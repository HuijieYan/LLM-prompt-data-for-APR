The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers on a Series. The function is not handling the case of a list indexer properly, which is leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the list-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where the behavior of list indexers is different from array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. It should properly check for the presence of the indexer in the index and raise a KeyError if it is not found.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers, resolving the KeyError issue and aligning the behavior with the expectations in the GitHub issue.
