The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block, where if `key` is not list-like it attempts to use `self.loc[key]`. The problem arises when `key` is a pandas Series, because it's treated as non-list-like and thus the code erroneously tries to access `self.loc[key]`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to add a check for pandas Series in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block and handle that case separately. The correction will involve treating a pandas Series as list-like in this context.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        # treat Series as list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

With the correction above, the `key` argument is checked to see if it is a pandas Series. If it is, `self.loc[key]` is utilized to handle the case of indexing the Series with another Series. This adjustment should fix the bug and allow the corrected version of the function to pass the failing test.
