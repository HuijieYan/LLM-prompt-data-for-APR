```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
``` 

Explanation:
- The bug occurs due to the inconsistent behavior of indexers, especially with list indexers, and leading to an incorrect KeyError when indexing a Series with a list.
- The bug is also associated with the improper handling of input key types within the _get_with function.
- The corrected version of the function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or not list-like, array-like, or Series, and then applies the appropriate indexing method.

This corrected version should address the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys, including lists. It also aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the issue posted on GitHub.
