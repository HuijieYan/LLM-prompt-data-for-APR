Since the cause of the bug seems to be how the function handles the `key_type` variable, assigning arbitrary strings instead of a properly inferred type, it is necessary to redefine the conditions and checks for `key_type`. The function also needs to be refactored to handle the input differently. 

Here's a potential strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to properly infer the type of the `key` and assign it to the `key_type` variable using appropriate pandas functions.
2. Refactor the function to handle different types of keys, such as integers, lists, Index, etc., in a unified manner, ensuring that the reindexing process is performed correctly.
3. Add error handling to ensure that unsupported data types, such as DataFrame, are properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == 'integer':
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == 'boolean':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == 'mixed':
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper type inference for the `key` and updates the logic to handle different key types appropriately.

Note: The above code assumes that the `ensure_index` function is available from the `pandas.core.indexes.api` module, but is not explicitly imported due to the prior provided list of available imports.
