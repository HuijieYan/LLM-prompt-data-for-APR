The bug in the function `_get_with` appears to be related to the determination of the key type. Based on the analysis of runtime inputs and expected outputs, it seems that the key type is not being determined accurately, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for determining the `key_type` by ensuring that the type is correctly inferred for different types of input keys. The function should be modified to handle different types of keys and index objects more accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.is_scalar(key)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the code has been updated to handle different types of input keys and determine `key_type` based on the type of the input key. The correct operation (selection by label or by position) is then performed based on the determined `key_type`.
