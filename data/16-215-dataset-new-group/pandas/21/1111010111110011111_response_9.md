The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when a list indexer is used, resulting in inconsistent behavior when compared to other array-like indexers. The issue is related to different treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and errors in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers behave consistently with other array-like indexers, producing the same results and not raising errors. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional checks and logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle the case for list indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246 and reindex the Series
            return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the case of scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these changes, the corrected function now properly handles list indexers, producing consistent results and avoiding errors.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values described. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This fix ensures consistent and predictable behavior for all types of indexers used with the Series.
