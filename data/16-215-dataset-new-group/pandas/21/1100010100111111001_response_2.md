The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to handling the `key` parameter. The error message suggests that the function is unable to index a Series with a certain type of key. The function seems to incorrectly determine the `key` type as "string" instead of an appropriate type.

To fix this bug, we need to handle different types of keys more accurately and return the result accordingly. Also, in the last condition, we need to reindex the Series with the given key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling different types of keys
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key).__name__}")
```

With the corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of keys accurately and return the expected results. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
