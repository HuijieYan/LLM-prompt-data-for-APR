Based on the information provided, the bug in the _get_with function is related to how different types of indexers are treated, specifically when using a list indexer that contains no matches. This inconsistency causes a KeyError to be raised.

To fix this bug, we can modify the _get_with function to handle list indexers with no matches in a consistent manner, similar to how other indexers are handled. This will involve updating the logic to ensure that list indexers are treated in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.reindex(key)
        except KeyError:
            return self._graceful_fail(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)

def _graceful_fail(self, key):
    # Handle failed reindex gracefully, returning a Series of NaNs
    dtype = self._constructor._maybe_cast_indexer_dtype()

    if is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, ABCMultiIndex):
        dt = dtype
    else:
        dt = None

    na = np.nan
    data = np.array([na] * len(key), dtype=dtype)
    index = ensure_index(key)

    return self._constructor(data, index=index, dtype=dt)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a try-except block around the reindex operation for list indexers. If a KeyError is raised during reindexing, it is caught, and a graceful fail approach is taken to return a Series of NaNs for the elements that were not found in the index.

This fix ensures that list indexers with no matches behave consistently with other array-like indexers, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
