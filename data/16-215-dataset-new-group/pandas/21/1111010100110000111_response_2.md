The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers. When using a list as an indexer, it is treated differently from array-like indexers such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The inconsistency in behavior leads to an error when trying to access a Series using a list indexer that contains no matches.

The error message `KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"` indicates that the list indexer `['C']` does not match any value in the Series index, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers. We can do this by modifying the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like indexers, which should resolve the inconsistency and fix the bug.
