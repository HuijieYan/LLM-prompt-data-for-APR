The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be attempting to access an element in a series by using a key. There are multiple errors in the function that could cause it to fail. One issue is that it fails to properly handle specific input types such as `pd.Index` and `pd.Series`. The error message indicates that it did not raise a `KeyError` which implies that the logic in the `_get_with` method is not handling certain types of keys correctly.

One useful strategy for fixing the bug in `_get_with` is to explicitly handle different types of keys, such as `pd.Index` and `pd.Series`, to ensure that they are processed appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # Convert the slice to positional or label-based and then return the result
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Return the result for location-based indexing
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, list)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle edge cases such as specific input types and ensure that both positional and label-based indexing behaves correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
