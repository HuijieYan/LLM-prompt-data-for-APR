The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. This is leading to different behaviors in the `ser[key]` operation, as demonstrated by the failing test cases.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and variables, it is clear that the `key_type` variable is being set to `'string'`, which is incorrect. This leads to the incorrect behavior in the function.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` should be revised to accurately identify the type of the key being passed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "bool":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised code includes additional checks for scalar keys and boolean keys, and the logic for determining the `key_type` has been updated to accurately identify the type of key being passed.

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass and the inconsistencies in how different indexers are treated will be resolved.
