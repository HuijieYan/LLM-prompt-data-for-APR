The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function due to the way it handles the `key` parameter. The function has a conditional block that checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different actions based on its type. However, the handling of different input types seems to be causing issues. The specific issue arises when the `key` is a list or an ndarray, as highlighted in the failing test cases.

The function incorrectly infers the type of the `key` parameter. In all the failing cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly assigned as 'string' at the end of the function, which is causing the subsequent logic to fail.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly infer the type of the `key` parameter and choose the appropriate action.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # check if the key is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # check if the key is a tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # check if the key is a scalar or other non-list-like object
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case where key is not a scalar, list, ndarray, or Index
    if not isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # determine the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle boolean type
    if key_type == "boolean":
        # this is not needed as the boolean type is caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle integer type
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle list type
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly infer the type of the `key` and perform the appropriate action based on its type.

Please note that the corrected version of the function assumes that `lib.infer_dtype` correctly infers the type of the `key` parameter. If there are specific cases where it fails, those would need to be handled separately.
