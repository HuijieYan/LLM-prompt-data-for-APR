The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different indexers such as list, array-like, Index, or Series. The error messages from the failing test indicate that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with the other types of indexers. This inconsistency is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of list indexers is causing a KeyError, while the other types of indexers do not.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to how the function handles different types of indexers. Specifically, when dealing with a list as an indexer, the function does not handle the case properly, leading to the KeyError. This inconsistency is the reason for the failing tests and the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle the list indexer in the same way it handles other types of indexers, ensuring consistency and preventing KeyError errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._slice(key)
    else:
        result = self.loc[key]
        return result if isinstance(result, ABCSeries) else self._constructor(result, name=self.name)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the `key` is a slice, DataFrame, or tuple, and if not, it directly uses `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values and return the result.

This change ensures that no matter the type of indexer used, the same behavior is expected, and the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
