The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be occurring when trying to index by passing a `key` that is a Series object. The code then tries to convert the `key` into a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, or Index, and then it attempts to infer the data type of the `key` using `lib.infer_dtype`. 

The bug arises when trying to infer the data type of the `key`, which doesn't handle cases where the `key` is a Series object well. This results in the `_get_with` function returning a result that doesn't match the expected behavior. This causes the failing test to raise a `KeyError` as it expects different behavior when indexing the `Series` with a similar object.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the `key` is a `Series` by performing the indexing directly and returning that result. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

It is important to note that the fix is to include a direct handling case for when `key` is a Series object by indexing the Series directly and returning that result.
