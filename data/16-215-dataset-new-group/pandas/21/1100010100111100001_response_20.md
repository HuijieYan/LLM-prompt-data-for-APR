The bug in the _get_with function is likely causing the failing tests due to the mishandling of the key parameter. The key parameter is being handled differently based on its type, but there are inconsistencies and incorrect assumptions in the function's logic.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately identify the type of the key parameter and handle it accordingly. It seems that key_type is being incorrectly assigned as 'string' in all cases, which is not a valid type for indexing a Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        # handle scalars and non-Series types
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, we handle different types of keys more accurately and efficiently, making sure that the correct operations are performed based on the type of the key parameter.

This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
