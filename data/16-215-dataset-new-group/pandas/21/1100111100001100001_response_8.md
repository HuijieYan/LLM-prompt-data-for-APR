The bug in the function seems to be related to how it handles different types of input for the variable `key`. The function is designed to return a specific type of output based on the type of `key`, but it seems to be incorrectly identifying the type in some cases.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it's clear that the `key_type` variable is being incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, regardless of the actual type of the `key` input. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key`.

One strategy for fixing this bug is to explicitly check the type of the `key` input using conditionals. By correctly identifying the type of the `key` input, the function should return the appropriate output based on that type.

Here is a corrected version of the function that includes explicit type checking for the `key` input:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = 'list'
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = 'ndarray'
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = 'Index'
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key_type = 'other'
    
    if key_type == 'list':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == 'ndarray':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == 'Index':
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly checks the type of the `key` input and returns the appropriate output based on that type. This should resolve the bug by properly identifying the type of the `key` input and handling it accordingly.
