## Analysis:
The function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object in pandas. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may be causing unexpected behavior. 

1. The function is checking if the `key` is a slice, but there is no clear handling of slice objects within the subsequent conditional block. This could lead to incorrect behavior when dealing with slice objects.
2. There is a check for whether the `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, but the intended behavior for this case is not clear. This could be causing unexpected type errors.
3. There are multiple checks for the type of the `key` using `is_list_like` and `isinstance`. The intended logic for handling different types of keys is not well-defined.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original function arises from the unclear handling of different types of keys for indexing. This leads to potential errors in handling slice objects, DataFrame keys, and non-list-like keys.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by explicitly defining the expected behavior for handling slice objects, DataFrame keys, and different types of keys. This can be achieved by providing clear conditional logic for each type of key.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for each type of key is explicitly defined. Slices are handled using `iloc`, DataFrame keys raise a type error, tuples are directly passed to `self.loc`, non-list-like keys are handled with `self.loc`, and other types of keys are passed to `self.reindex` for indexing.
