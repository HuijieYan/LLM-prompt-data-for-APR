The bug in the function `_get_with` occurs when trying to index a Series with an unsupported data type. Specifically, the bug occurs when the `key` variable is not recognized as a list-like object and is not a boolean, integer, or known data type. In this case, the function tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError, as demonstrated in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the function reverts to the desired behavior, such as raising an error or reindexing the Series.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Add handling for unrecognized data types
    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        raise KeyError(f"The key {key} is not a valid index for the Series")

    # Modify the condition for recognizing key as an integer
    if not is_list_like(key) and (is_integer(key) or is_scalar(key)):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function:
- We added an explicit check for unrecognized data types by using `is_list_like` and `is_scalar` functions.
- If the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an integer or scalar, the function raises a KeyError with an appropriate message.
- We modified the condition for recognizing the key as an integer to include `is_scalar(key)`.

This corrected version of the function should now handle unsupported data types correctly and pass the failing test.
