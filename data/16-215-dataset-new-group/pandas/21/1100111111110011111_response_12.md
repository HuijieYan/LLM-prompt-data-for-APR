The issue in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the indexing behavior when using a list as the indexer for a Series. The behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other array-like indexers such as pandas Index or numpy array.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers properly, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used. We also need to ensure that the correct type inference for the `key` parameter is used to determine the indexing behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (bool, np.bool_)):
        key = [key]  # Convert boolean scalar to list
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "boolean" or isinstance(key, bool):
        # Convert boolean arrays or scalars to list for consistent indexing
        key = list(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now handles list-like indexers, boolean scalars, and boolean arrays consistently, ensuring that the expected values are returned for different types of indexers.

This corrected function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
