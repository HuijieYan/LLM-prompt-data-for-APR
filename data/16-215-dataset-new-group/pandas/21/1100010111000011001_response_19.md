The issue in the `buggy` function is that it is returning the wrong `key_type` value before the function's return. It is consistently returning `'string'`, which is incorrect.
The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly infer the type of the key and set the `key_type` value to the correct type.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of the `key` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `buggy` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version incorporates the logic to infer the `key_type` based on the `key` parameter and uses it appropriately in the subsequent code. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
