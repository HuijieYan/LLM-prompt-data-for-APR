The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. The problem occurs when trying to access a series using a list indexer, which raises a KeyError, while using array-like indexers or a Pandas Index does not.

To resolve this issue, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with how it handles array-like indexers and Pandas Index. The logic for treating list indexers should be aligned with the behavior for array-like indexers and Pandas Index to ensure uniformity in accessing the series.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_get_with` function to address this issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected implementation, the handling of list indexers has been updated to be consistent with the handling of array-like indexers and Pandas Index. The conditional block now checks if the key is an instance of list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, and then uses `self.loc[key]` to access the series data.

With this correction, the inconsistent behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue will be resolved, and the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers uniformly. This fix ensures that accessing a series with a list indexer will no longer raise a KeyError, providing a consistent and expected behavior across different types of indexers.
