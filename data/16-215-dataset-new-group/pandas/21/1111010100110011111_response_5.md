The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent treatment of different indexer types, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when using list-like indexers. The issue was reported on GitHub, highlighting the inconsistency and suggesting that all indexers should behave similarly to the list case.

To fix the bug, we need to standardize the behavior of different indexers, ensuring that they all behave consistently and handle edge cases uniformly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, slice):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all indexers are handled consistently, preventing the inconsistency and errors encountered in the previous version. This fix addresses the reported GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
