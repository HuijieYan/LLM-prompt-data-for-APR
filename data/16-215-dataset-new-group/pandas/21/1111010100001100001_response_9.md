## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` is not handling the case where `key` is a list properly. It incorrectly converts the key to a list and does not differentiate between different types of keys. This leads to incorrect handling of the key, and as a result, the function may return the wrong value or raise an error.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the different types of keys and ensure that they are processed appropriately. We can create specific conditions for each type of key and handle them accordingly to ensure that the function returns the correct value.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_integer(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if key_type == "boolean" or key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we handle the different types of keys separately and ensure that they are processed appropriately. We also check for scalar types and handle them differently to avoid issues with incorrect index handling.
