The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for different behaviors based on the type of indexer passed to it. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically for `ser.loc[key]`. It shows that using `ser[key]` or `ser[pd.Index(key)]` does not raise an error, but using `ser[list(key)]` does. This inconsistency needs to be addressed in the `_get_with` function.

The bug is likely to be caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function, resulting in the error described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling for all types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Additionally, we need to address the specific case where `ser[list(key)]` raises an error, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = np.asarray(key)
    if not is_integer(key) and not is_bool(key) and not is_categorical_dtype(key) and not is_object_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly checks for non-list-like and non-scalar keys and handles them appropriately using NumPy's `asarray` function and the `ensure_index` function from Pandas. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
