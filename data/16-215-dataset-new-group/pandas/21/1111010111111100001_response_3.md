The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the input key properly and is not returning the correct value when trying to access the Series with a key that is not found in the index.

The function needs to be fixed to handle non-matching keys and raise the appropriate `KeyError` in such cases. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass without raising a `KeyError`.
