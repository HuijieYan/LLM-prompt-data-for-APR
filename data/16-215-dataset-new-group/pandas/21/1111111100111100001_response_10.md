The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect handling of the input `key`. The function should handle cases where `key` is a list, array, Index, or Series, but it incorrectly infers the type of `key` in some cases, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly handle each type of `key` and ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle slices, arrays, lists, Index, and Series types for the `key` parameter and use the `loc` method for indexing. This should address the KeyError issue and ensure that the function behaves correctly for different input types.
