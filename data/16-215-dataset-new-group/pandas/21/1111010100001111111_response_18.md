The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers in the input `key`. The `key` parameter is provided as either a list, ndarray, Index, or other data types, and the function is expected to handle each type of input correctly.

The bug occurs because different types of indexers are treated differently, leading to inconsistent behavior. Specifically, when the input `key` is a list, the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a KeyError, while it processes other types of indexers without issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that the function returns the expected values for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, and we use the `loc` method to retrieve the values based on the index passed in `key`. This approach ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and resolves the inconsistencies observed in the failing test cases.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue posted.
