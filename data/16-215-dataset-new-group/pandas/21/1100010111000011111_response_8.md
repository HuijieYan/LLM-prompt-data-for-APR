The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of indexers. The issue is specifically related to the handling of list indexers, which is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are treated. This inconsistency has been identified in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The cause of the bug is in the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers. When a list indexer is used, the function is not properly handling the KeyError that is raised, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, including list, numpy array, pandas Index, and Series. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional logic to handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers, ensuring that the KeyError is properly handled and consistent behavior is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = getattr(key, 'values', key)  # convert to array-like if necessary

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a step to convert the key to an array-like type if it's not already in that format. This ensures that list indexers are treated similarly to other array-like indexers.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
