The bug appears to be related to the behavior of the `_get_with` function when handling different types of indexers. The function is not consistently treating list indexers the same way it treats other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential errors.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the key_type is incorrectly determined as 'string' in all cases, which is likely causing the inconsistent and incorrect behavior when processing the key input parameter.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles it appropriately. Additionally, the function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other types
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've added a check to handle list indexers consistently with other types, and I've preserved the rest of the original logic for handling different types of indexers.

This approach should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and provide a more reliable and consistent behavior for the `_get_with` function.
