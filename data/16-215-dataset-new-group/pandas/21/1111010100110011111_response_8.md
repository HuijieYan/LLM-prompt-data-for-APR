To resolve the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas/core/series.py.

The bug occurs when the `ser[key]` operation behaves differently for `pd.Index`, `np.array`, and `list` indexers. It raises a `KeyError` for the `list` indexer, but not for the others. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to make all types of indexers behave consistently with the `list` case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers
    raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the index")
```

This correction will ensure that all types of indexers raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index, providing consistent behavior across different indexer types. This fix resolves the issue reported on GitHub and ensures consistent behavior for all cases.
