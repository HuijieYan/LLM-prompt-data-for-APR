The issue in the `_get_with` function is that it is not distinguishing between different types of input `key` correctly. This results in an incorrect determination of the variable `key_type`, leading to a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior when the function is called.

The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of input for the `key` parameter, as well as the incorrect determination of the `key_type` variable affecting the behavior of the function.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to properly identify and handle different types of input for the `key` parameter and ensure that the `key_type` variable reflects the correct type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, input `key` is appropriately handled and processed based on its type. Additionally, the determination of the `key_type` variable is adjusted to accurately reflect the type of the `key`.
