Firstly, the buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle various index types, but it is doing this in a way that is not consistent with pandas conventions and is leading to an incorrect selection. The bug occurs for a specific case where a key is passed for selection but none of the values in the key are present in the Series index. The bug can be fixed by explicitly handling this case and raising a KeyError when none of the values in the key are found in the index.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function should have the following structure:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    index = self.index
    indexer = index.get_indexer_for(key)
    mask = indexer == -1
    if mask.any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not index.equals(self.index):
        return self.reindex(indexer)

    return self._constructor(self._data.get_slice(indexer), index=index)

```

This corrected version ensures that if none of the values in the key are present in the Series index, it will raise a KeyError with a message indicating that none of the values are in the index. This aligns with the expected behavior of pandas Series indexing and will resolve the failing test issue.
