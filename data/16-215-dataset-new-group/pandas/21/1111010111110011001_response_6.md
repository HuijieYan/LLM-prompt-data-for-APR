The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how the function handles the `key` parameter and its type. It checks whether the `key` is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object and performs different actions based on the type. However, the handling of the `key` parameter might not be consistent with the expected behavior.

The failing test indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` when performing the operation `ser[key]`. This suggests that the function is not handling the key properly and is not raising the right exception when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the different types of keys correctly, and that it raises the appropriate exception when the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test cases.
