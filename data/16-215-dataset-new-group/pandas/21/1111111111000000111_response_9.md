The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas/core/series.py` file has a bug that causes it to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This bug arises when using a list indexer that results in a KeyError, while the same operation with an array-like indexer does not.

The cause of the bug is due to the conditional branching within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers in the `_get_with` function. We can achieve this by updating the conditional statements to handle different types of indexers uniformly and address the KeyError issue for list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle different types of indexers uniformly and address the KeyError issue for list indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.
