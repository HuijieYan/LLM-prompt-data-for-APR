The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the key parameter. The key parameter is expected to be used to access values from the Series, but the function is unable to handle it properly for certain types of input.

The cause of the bug is most likely the incorrect type detection of the key parameter and its processing based on that type. The function should be able to handle different types of keys, including lists, ndarrays, and Index objects, but due to incorrect type inference, it fails to do so.

Based on the analysis, the bug is occurring due to the incorrect inference of the key type, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to handle the key.

To fix the bug, you can modify the key type inference logic to accurately detect the type of the key parameter and handle it accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the incorrect type inference and ensure that the function can handle different types of keys properly. It should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
