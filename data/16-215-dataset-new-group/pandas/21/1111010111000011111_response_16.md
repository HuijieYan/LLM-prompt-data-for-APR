To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The issue is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically list indexers, and the inconsistency in the behavior of these indexers.

The bug occurs when using a list indexer. The bug is caused by inconsistency in how the function handles different types of indexers, particularly list indexers, and results in a KeyError when trying to index a Series with a list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. One option is to modify the function to use the same logic for list indexers as for other types of indexers, such as array-like or Index indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, pd.Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, pd.Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for `pd.Index` to ensure that it is handled consistently with other types of indexers. The fix ensures that list indexers are handled consistently and should now pass the failing test.
