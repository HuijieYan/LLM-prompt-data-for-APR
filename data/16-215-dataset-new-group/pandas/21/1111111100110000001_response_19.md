The `ser[key]` operation fails with a `KeyError` as the error message shows. An issue seems to arise from the `_get_with` function, as it takes a `key` as input, and the bug appears to be related to the handling of the `key`.

The root cause of the bug may be that the `key` variable is not being handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. It is being checked against a series of conditions and it seems to not follow the expected processing flow.

To fix the bug, we can revise the conditions used to process the `key` variable and ensure that it is being handled properly. We'll need to determine how to correctly deal with the types of `key` that are being checked in the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray)):
        slobj = key
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type in ['list', 'boolean']:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # if the key does not match any condition above, reindex the series
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By refining the handling of different data types within the `_get_with` function, this corrected version will likely address the previous errors. However, further testing and validation with respective test cases is necessary to confirm that the function passes the failing tests.
