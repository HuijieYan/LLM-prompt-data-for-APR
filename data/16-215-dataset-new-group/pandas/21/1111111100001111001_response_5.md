The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it does not properly handle the case when the input `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray. It ends up reusing the `reindex` method when it should be using the `loc` method instead. Additionally, it incorrectly infers the `key_type` and does not handle the case where the `key_type` is 'string'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs and properly perform slicing or indexing based on the type of the key.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we removed the unnecessary check for `key_type` and directly used the `loc` method for handling all types of key inputs, including lists, ndarrays, Index objects, Series objects, and ExtensionArray objects. This aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the bug.
