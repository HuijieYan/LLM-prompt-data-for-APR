The bug in the `key_type` variable being assigned the value `'string'` regardless of the type of the `key` input. This is likely because the conditional checks in the function are not accurately capturing the type of the input `key`. Additionally, the specific problem identified in the GitHub issue is related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, which is also directly related to the bug in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to accurately determine the type of the `key` input and handle each type appropriately. Also, we need to ensure consistency in handling list indexers and array-like indexers as described in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we have added additional checks to accurately determine the type of the `key` input and handle each type appropriately. Additionally, we have included consistent handling for list indexers and array-like indexers as described in the GitHub issue.
