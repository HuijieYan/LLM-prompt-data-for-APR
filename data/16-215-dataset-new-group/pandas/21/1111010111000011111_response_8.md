The buggy function `_get_with` has a code path that handles the case when the `key` is a list, and it seems to be the source of the bug. The expected return values are not correct for this case, which leads to the failing test.

The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. This inconsistency is highlighted in a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue describes how different types of indexers are treated differently, leading to inconsistent behavior and an unexpected KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, especially when handling a list as an indexer. We should update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the handling of list-like key is improved to match the behavior of other array-like indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and address the failing test case.
