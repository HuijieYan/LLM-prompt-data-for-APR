The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `Series` class. The provided function `_get_with` seems to have issues with handling different types of indexers, leading to incorrect behavior.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it can be seen that the `key_type` is being inferred as a string regardless of the type of `key` being passed. This incorrect inference of the `key_type` is the cause of the bug, resulting in the function returning unexpected output.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should correctly identify the type of `key` and handle it appropriately to return the expected output. Specifically, the function should correctly infer the type of the `key` and implement the logic to handle different types of indexers and return the appropriate result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly determines the type of `key` and then handles it based on the inferred type. It also ensures that different types of indexers are handled appropriately, resulting in the expected output for each case.

By implementing this corrected version, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the function should behave consistently for different types of indexers, as expected.
