The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are:
1. The function does not handle all possible cases correctly.
2. The function does not clearly differentiate between positional and label-based indexing.

The cause of the bug may be due to the improper handling of different types of indexers and incorrect inference of the key type.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to:
1. Clearly differentiate between label-based and positional indexing.
2. Handle all possible cases including different types of indexers.
3. Ensure proper inference of the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not (is_bool(key) or is_dict_like(key)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key) and not is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Proper checks for scalar and list-like key types are included.
2. The inference of the key type is improved to handle more cases.
3. The differentiation between label-based and positional indexing is clarified.
