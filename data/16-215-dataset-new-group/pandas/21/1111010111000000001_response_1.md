Based on the buggy function provided, the potential error locations within the function are identified in the conditional statements. The specific bugs in the _get_with function are related to the if-elif-else chain at the beginning and improper indexing when the key_type is neither boolean nor integer. When the condition for isinstance(key, tuple) is not met, the function should return a KeyError for failed indexing.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle various types of key inputs, resulting in unexpected errors such as KeyError when indexing with a key that is not found. This leads to failing test cases as the expected behavior is not met.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle different key types appropriately and ensure that failed indexing returns a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles different types of keys and raises a KeyError for failed indexing.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases.
