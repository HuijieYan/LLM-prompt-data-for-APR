The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has several potential error locations. 

1. The check for DataFrame in the `key` parameter is incorrect. Instead of `ABCDataFrame`, it should be checking for `pandas.DataFrame`.
2. The logic for handling different types of keys is complicated and can be simplified.
3. The logic for handling different data types like integer, boolean, and reindexing may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling different types of keys correctly, leading to potential errors in indexing and slicing.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that the correct actions are taken for each type of key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, we simplified the logic by removing unnecessary checks and handling all other cases using `self.loc[key]`, which is the recommended way to access elements. Additionally, we changed `ABCDataFrame` to `pd.DataFrame` for the correct DataFrame type checking.
