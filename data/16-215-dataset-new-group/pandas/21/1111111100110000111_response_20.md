## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of indexers, such as slice, tuple, DataFrame, list, numpy array, etc. However, the issue seems to be arising when a list indexer is used. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers, as described in the GitHub issue.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that when a list indexer is used, a KeyError is raised, while the behavior for other types of indexers is different.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function, particularly when a list indexer is used. This inconsistency is leading to the KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle a list indexer in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. The behavior for list indexers should align with the behavior for other types of indexers, and also align with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

The correction involves removing the redundant type check for list-indexing, and handling the list-indexing in the same manner as other indexers are handled. This modification should align with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.
