## Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the different behaviors of list indexers and array-like indexers when used with the `ser[key]` syntax. The `ser[list(key)]` case is raising a `KeyError` while the other cases are not raising errors.

The `_get_with` function seems to be treating different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which might be causing the function to reindex the series, leading to the KeyError.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index) inside the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and KeyError when using list indexers.

The function doesn't handle the list indexer case properly, resulting in a Key error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to handle different types of indexers consistently.
2. Ensure that the function does not raise a KeyError when using list indexers.
3. Verify the inferred type of the key and ensure it aligns with the behavior of the indexing.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle list indexer case
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a specific handling for list indexers to ensure that it returns the expected result without raising a KeyError. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue and fix the KeyError in the failing tests.
