The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when a list is used as the key. The issue on GitHub suggests that the behavior is inconsistent when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers like `np.array` or `pd.Index`.

Given the failing test cases and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug may be related to the way the function handles different types of indexers, especially lists.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers. We can update the code to properly validate and handle the different types of indexers for `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not supported"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert scalar key to list
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "unicode"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the `slice` type, then check for `ABCDataFrame` or `np.ndarray` types. Next, we convert a scalar key to a list if it's not already list-like. Then, we infer the type of the key using `lib.infer_dtype`. Depending on the inferred type, we handle integer or unicode types differently, and finally, we handle the reindexing for other types of keys.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
