The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values. However, it has a bug where it incorrectly infers the key_type when the key is not list-like.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly identifies the key_type when it's not list-like, which leads to inconsistencies in handling the indexers.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for inferring the key_type when the key is not list-like and handle the cases where the key is a list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is not list-like and is either an Index or a Series. If it is, we return the corresponding values using `self.loc[key]`. Otherwise, we infer the key_type and handle the cases based on the inferred key_type. If the key is a list, we use `self.loc[key]` to handle the duplicate indexing case. If none of the conditions match, we reindex the key.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output values and types. This fix also addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers as reported in the GitHub issue.
