The issue is related to the handling of different types of indexers in the `pandas` library, specifically when using a list indexer with no matches. The `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, and the behavior is inconsistent.

The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, including list indexers. The bug appears to be related to the handling of the list indexer, leading to inconsistent behavior with no matches.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers in comparison to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of list indexers with no matches differs from other types of indexers.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent handling of list indexers in comparison to other types of indexers, especially in cases where there are no matches.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list and array-like indexers
    if not self._get_indexer(key).empty:
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]

```
