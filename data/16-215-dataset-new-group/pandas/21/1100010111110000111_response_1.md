The bug is in the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue arises when using list-like indexers, causing inconsistency in the behavior of accessing elements with different types of indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` provides a `KeyError` for indexers of type `list`, indicating that none of the elements are found in the index.

The corresponding GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" explains the inconsistency in behavior when accessing elements using different types of indexers. The issue suggests that all indexers should behave like the list case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type for indexer: {type(key)}")
```

In the corrected function, a check is added to handle different types of indexers and ensure that the behavior is consistent for all cases.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should behave consistently for different types of indexers, passing all relevant tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
