The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. When a list key is passed, it raises a `KeyError` while other array-like indexers do not. This behavior is inconsistent and not aligned with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to maintain consistency. We can do this by handling list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the key is not list-like or if it is an instance of Index, we can handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub regarding inconsistent handling of list indexers.
