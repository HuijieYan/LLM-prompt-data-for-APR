The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when passing a list indexer, but not when passing other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that for list-like indexers, the code is not handling them properly, causing the inconsistency in behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to correctly handle list-like indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self[key]
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function correctly handles list-like indexers by using `loc` for list and array-like indexers and falling back to the default indexing behavior for other types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure consistent behavior when using different types of indexers.
