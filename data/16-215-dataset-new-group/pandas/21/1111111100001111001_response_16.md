Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the determination of the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` parameter, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent code execution. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables as well as the expected values and types during the test execution.

The bug is present in the conditional statements that determine the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter. The function is incorrectly identifying the `key` type, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to accurately determine the type of the `key` parameter and assign the correct `key_type` value based on its type. The conditional statements should be revised to accurately handle the different types of `key` and assign the appropriate `key_type` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = None
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
            key_type = 'others'  
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif is_scalar(key):
        key_type = 'scalar'
        
    if key_type is None:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid key type: {type(key)}")

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we accurately determine the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter using the conditional statements. We handle different types of `key` and assign the appropriate `key_type` value. The function also includes a check for invalid key types and raises a `TypeError` in such cases. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.
