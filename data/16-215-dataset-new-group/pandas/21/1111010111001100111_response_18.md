The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior when using a list as the indexer for a Series object.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when the indexer is list-like. This results in an inconsistent behavior where the `ser[list(key)]` statement raises a KeyError, while other indexers like `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers properly. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for handling list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across all indexer types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For list-like indexers:
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This modified version of the function ensures that all list-like indexers are handled consistently and appropriately. It checks if the indexer is an Index type or a numpy array type and uses the `reindex` method in those cases. For other list-like indexers, it defaults to using the `loc` attribute to return the values.

With this corrected implementation, the function should behave consistently for all types of indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
