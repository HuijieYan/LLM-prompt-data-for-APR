The issue on GitHub is related to the inconsistency in behavior when using different indexers in a Series. The problem is that the behavior is not consistent between using a list indexer and other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers or a Series index.


Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Handling of different key types and the nature of indexers.
2. Inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers.


Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer with a Series.


Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with that of other types of indexers. This may involve updating the logic to handle different types of indexers, including list indexers, array-like indexers, and Series indexers.


Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version of the function, we have updated the logic to handle different types of indexers consistently. This includes checking for scalar values, array-like indexers, Series indexers, and list indexers, and handling them appropriately. This should resolve the inconsistency and the issue reported on GitHub.
