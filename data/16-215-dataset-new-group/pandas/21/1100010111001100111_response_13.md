The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it fails to handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError in certain cases. The issue on GitHub points out the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

The key_type is incorrectly set to `'integer'` for string indexers, which leads to the function returning a KeyError when it should be handling the indexers as list-like.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling list-like indexers and ensure that they are treated appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("category", "object", "string"):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like indexers and categorizing them separately based on their inferred type, we ensure that the function treats string indexers appropriately and avoids the KeyError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
