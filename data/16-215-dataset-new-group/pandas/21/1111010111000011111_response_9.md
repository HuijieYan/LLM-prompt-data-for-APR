One potential error location in the given buggy function is the conditional statement that checks for the type of the key. There are multiple conditional blocks checking for different types of `key`, but it seems that the `list` type indexer case is not being appropriately handled, which is consistent with the GitHub issue reported.

The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list type, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The list type indexer is not being handled in the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to an unexpected KeyError and inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the list type indexer is handled in the same way as other array-like indexers, as requested in the GitHub issue. This means addressing the conditional block for the list type indexer to handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional block handling the list type indexer has been adjusted to match the handling of other array-like indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the inconsistency and the unexpected KeyError when using a list type indexer.
