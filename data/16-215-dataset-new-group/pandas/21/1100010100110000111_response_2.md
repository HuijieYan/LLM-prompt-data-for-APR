### Bug Analysis
The error messages indicate that the `ser[key]` operation fails to raise a `KeyError` when the key is provided as a list, but it works for other array-like input types such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. This inconsistency in the behavior of different input types leads to the failing test.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are related to the handling of the input key types. Specifically, there are conditional statements to handle different input types, and the bug might be related to how lists are processed compared to other array-like input types.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. It was reported in the GitHub issue that the `ser.loc[key]` also raises an error for all input types, indicating that the behavior of `ser[key]` is inconsistent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be aligned with the behavior of other array-like indexers such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. This can involve modifying the conditional logic to provide a consistent treatment for all array-like input types.

### The corrected version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = ensure_index(self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem"))
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Convert scalar key to list
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures that the key is always converted to an Index type if it's an array-like input. If the input is a scalar value or unsupported type, it is converted to a list before further processing. This ensures consistent handling of all input types.
