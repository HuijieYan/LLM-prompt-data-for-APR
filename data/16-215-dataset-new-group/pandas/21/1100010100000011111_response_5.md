The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list indexers correctly, especially when there are no matches. This inconsistency is causing unexpected behavior and raising errors. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently, ensuring it behaves correctly when no matches are found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_iterator(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for list indexers before trying to perform a lookup using `.loc`. If the key is a list and not an iterator (which would include arrays, for example), we attempt to access the data using `.loc`, and if a `KeyError` is raised, we fall back to reindexing the data.

This approach ensures consistent handling of list indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub while satisfying all expected input/output values.
