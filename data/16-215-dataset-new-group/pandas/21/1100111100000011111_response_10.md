The buggy function has a logical error in the key type check, causing it to return incorrect values. The key type is not being determined correctly, which leads to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is identified correctly and that the function returns the expected values based on the key type. We can use the `type` function to check if the key is a specific type, such as a string or list, and then return the corresponding values accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = type(key).__name__
    else:
        key_list = list(key)
        key_type = type(key_list).__name__

    if key_type == "str":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key_list]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function checks the type of the key and returns the expected values based on the key type, ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

The correction addresses the issue posted in GitHub by handling different types of indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for all cases.
