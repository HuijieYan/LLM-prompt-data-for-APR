The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically with list indexers. The failing test cases indicate that when using a list indexer as the key to access the Series, a `KeyError` is raised, while it should not be.

The cause of the bug is likely in the handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is passed, it is determined whether it should be treated as a positional indexer (`self.iloc`) or label-based indexer (`self.loc`). However, the implementation appears to be incorrect, as it is resulting in a `KeyError` for list indexers.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling list indexers needs to be revised in order to avoid the `KeyError` when accessing the Series with a list-like key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the implementation for handling list indexers has been adjusted to properly access the Series without raising a `KeyError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test cases pass.
