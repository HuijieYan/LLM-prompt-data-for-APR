The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when it should not. This is happening because the function is not properly handling the input `key` in some cases.

In Case 1, 2, and 3, the function is not correctly inferring the type of the `key` variable, resulting in the `key_type` being set as `'string'` instead of an appropriate type like `'object'`. This causes incorrect indexing operations and eventually leads to a `KeyError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the type inference part of the function to correctly handle the different types of the `key` input. By ensuring that the type inference is properly done, we can prevent the function from incorrectly attempting indexing operations and avoid the `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes an additional step to ensure that the `key` input is converted to an `Index` type using `ensure_index`. This step will help with properly inferring the type of `key` and ensure that the indexing operations are handled correctly.

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle different types of `key` inputs and avoid raising a `KeyError` in the failing tests.
