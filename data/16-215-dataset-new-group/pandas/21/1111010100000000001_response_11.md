The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the pandas library is supposed to handle different types of indexing keys and return the appropriate values. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function that need to be fixed:

1. The check for `ABCDataFrame` is not valid as the intention is to check if the key is a DataFrame.
2. The check for `ABCDataFrame` does not cover nested dataframes, which should also be handled.
3. The type check for the `Index` class and the subsequent `key_type` logic are not handling all the necessary cases for different index types.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all possible cases of indexing correctly, leading to potential errors or incorrect behavior when indexing a Series.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Correctly handle the case of indexing with a DataFrame.
2. Refactor the check for different key types to handle all possible cases and reduce redundancy in the code.
3. Add appropriate error handling and messages to clearly indicate the type of error when it occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles different types of keys more consistently and utilizes the functions from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` module to properly determine the type of key for indexing. Additionally, the error handling for indexing with a DataFrame is now part of the function.
