            elif not is_list_like(key):
                # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684

```

A potential issue in the provided function is that the `is_list_like` check is assuming that the `key` is returning false when it is of type `Index`, which is not the expected behavior. This leads to the function returning a `self.loc[key]`, which may not be the correct way to handle the `key` type.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `is_list_like` check to also include the check for `Index` type. Additionally, we need to handle the `Index` type separately and not directly return `self.loc[key]`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
    # The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/series.py

    # The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
    class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
        # ... (other parts of the class)

        # this is the corrected function
        def _get_with(self, key):
            # other: fancy integer or otherwise
            # existing code
            if isinstance(key, slice):
                # remaining code
            elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
                raise TypeError(
                    "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                    "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
                )
            elif isinstance(key, tuple):
                return self._get_values_tuple(key)

            elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
                # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, list):
                return self.reindex(key)

            # remaining code
```
