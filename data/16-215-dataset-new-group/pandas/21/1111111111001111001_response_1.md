The bug lies in how the function processes the key. The key_type is inferred incorrectly due to an issue with the type checking of the key.

The key_type should be identified correctly based on the type of the key, and the corresponding branch should be executed accordingly.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the logic for identifying the key type, which would involve adjusting the type checking conditions and the corresponding branches.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function should correct the issue by accurately identifying the key type and executing the appropriate branch.
