The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function inside the `Series` class. The error message indicates that it's failing during a test where indexing a Series with various types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) is expected to raise a KeyError.

The bug is likely at this line: `msg = r"None of \[Index\(\['C'\], dtype='object'\)\] are in the \[index\]"`. This line creates a regular expression pattern to look for in the error message, so the issue is likely related to the error message not containing the specified pattern.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to reevaluate how the error message is raised and ensure that the correct pattern is used to match the error message. Additionally, this may involve making sure that each of the individual cases (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are correctly handled in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Rewrite the condition for isinstance(key, Index) to handle the different types in an accurate way
    if isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Index)):
        # Extract the inferred type directly from the key
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # update the reindex call to use the new `index` functionality
    return self.reindex(index=key)
```

With the corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
