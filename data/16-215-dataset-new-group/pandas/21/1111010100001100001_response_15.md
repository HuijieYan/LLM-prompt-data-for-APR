The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic to determine the type of the key, which leads to incorrect handling of the input and returns inconsistent results.

The problematic part is the logic to determine the type of the key and how it is processed, leading to the incorrect variable `key_type` with the value `'string'`. This occurs because the function mistakenly infers the type of the key, but in reality, it should be identified as a label-based indexer and converted to positional.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the key type and its subsequent handling needs to be revamped to ensure that the correct type is inferred and processed accordingly. Additionally, the conditional branches need to be restructured to prevent overlapping cases and ensure appropriate handling for each type.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the key has been revised to address each type specifically, ensuring that the appropriate action is taken for each case. This revision should resolve the bug and enable the function to handle the input correctly.
