The issue with the provided function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The bug occurs when using the `ser[list(key)]` approach, as it raises a `KeyError` when trying to use a list indexer that contains no matches in the index.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer")
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It ensures consistent behavior when using different types of indexers.
