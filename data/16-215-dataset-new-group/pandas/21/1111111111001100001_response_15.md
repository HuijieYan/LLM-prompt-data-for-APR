The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely to be caused by the key being a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, which results in the IndexError being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where the key is not found in the index. We can use the `try` and `except` blocks to catch the KeyError and return an appropriate response.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes made include wrapping the `self.loc[key]` logic in a `try` block and catching the KeyError to raise a more meaningful error message if the key is not found in the index. This should address the issue of the failing tests.

By providing this update to the `_get_with` function, the failing test should pass, as the function now handles the case where the key is not found in the index.
