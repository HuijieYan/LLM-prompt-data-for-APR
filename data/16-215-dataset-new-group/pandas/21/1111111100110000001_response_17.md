The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle the case where a series is accessed using another series as the key, resulting in a KeyError. We will modify the code to handle this case and return the expected result.

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function because it does not properly handle the case where the key is another Series, Index, list, or np.ndarray, leading to a KeyError. This is evident from the error message indicating that the code "Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>".

To fix this bug, we can make use of the `_convert_for_reindex` function to properly handle the case when the key is another Series, Index, list, or np.ndarray. By doing so, we can ensure that the key is reindexed properly and the KeyError is avoided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index, list, np.ndarray)):
        # Reindexing the Series using the key
        return self._convert_for_reindex(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle all the cases properly and avoid the KeyError, passing the failing test.
