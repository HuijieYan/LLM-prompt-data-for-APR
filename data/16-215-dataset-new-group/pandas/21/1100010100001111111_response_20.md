Since the bug seems to be related to the dtype of the key when trying to index a Series, one potential error location is the determination of the key's type in the buggy function `_get_with`. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of different indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug could involve standardizing the behavior of different indexers and addressing the inconsistent behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the analysis and provided cases:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
            "supported, use positional indexing (i.e., self.iloc) or label-based indexing (i.e., self.loc)"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the if-else conditions have been revised to handle the different indexer types consistently, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post. Additionally, the TypeError message has been updated to provide more clear guidance on how to index a Series with DataFrame or Index.
