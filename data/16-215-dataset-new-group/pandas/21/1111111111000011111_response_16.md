To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. Currently, using a list indexer causes an error, while using other array-like indexers works as expected.

The root cause of the bug is in the conditional handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function. It incorrectly processes the list indexer differently from other array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError when a list indexer is used.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like indexers. This would align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle all non-list indexers in the same way as list indexers
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        # Both integer-based and label-based indexing should be handled
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Ensure consistent handling for all array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle all non-list indexers in the same way as list indexers, ensuring consistency and alignment with the expected behavior for array-like indexers. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
