The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing it to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the different types of indexers consistently, leading to the KeyError when using a list as the indexer.

To fix the bug, the function should handle all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently to avoid the inconsistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function should handle all types of indexers consistently and avoid the KeyError when using a list as the indexer.
