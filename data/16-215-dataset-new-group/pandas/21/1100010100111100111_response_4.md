The cause of the bug is that the condition `if key_type == "integer"` is not handling the case where the key is a list with no matches, and it's not reindexing the Series properly.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function properly handles the case where the key is a list with no matches by reindexing the Series based on the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported key type: {key_type}")
```

With this fix, the function properly handles the case when the key is a list with no matches by reindexing the Series based on the key, ensuring that the error reported in the GitHub issue is resolved.
