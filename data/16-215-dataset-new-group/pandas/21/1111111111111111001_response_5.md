The issue is caused by the `_get_with` function when it's supposed to handle the reindexing of the series. It fails to handle the case when the key is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or a pandas Series.

The bug can be fixed by properly handling these cases in the `_get_with` function.
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, Series)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling the cases of lists, numpy arrays, and pandas Index or Series specifically, we can ensure that the function will return the expected output for these data types.
