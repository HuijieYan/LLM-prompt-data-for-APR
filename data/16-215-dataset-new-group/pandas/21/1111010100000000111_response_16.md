The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is causing inaccurate behavior with list indexers, as described in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue focuses on the inconsistency of behavior when using different types of indexers when there are no matches. The specific problem arises when using a list indexer, which leads to a `KeyError` when there are no matches, unlike other types of indexers.

The bug is related to the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. The issue arises from the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` followed by `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))`. This logic is not correctly identifying list indexers and is causing them to behave differently from other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, you should modify the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly identify list indexers and handle them in the same way as other types of indexers. Additionally, the behavior for handling no matches with list indexers should be made consistent with other types of indexers. 

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = [key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We treat integer indexers consistently, using loc or iloc
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The modified function includes a check to ensure that the `key` is treated as a list if it is not an instance of any of the specified types. The logic for handling integer indexers has also been modified to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, the duplicate indexing case has been explicitly handled to provide consistency.
