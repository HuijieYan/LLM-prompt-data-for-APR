One potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the code block below the first `if` statement `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` where it checks `if isinstance(key, Index):`. When the parameter `key` is a series, it fails to fall into the correct condition.

Another potential error location is inside the `if` statement `if key_type == "integer":`, within the block that differentiates between positional and label-based indexing.

The cause of the bug is that the type-checks within the conditional statements are failing, causing the function to execute incorrect blocks of code. This bug creates an error where it does not raise the expected `KeyError` exception when accessing an element which does not exist in the series.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks inside the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle the types properly and execute the correct block of code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function checks for different types of indexes and handles them appropriately, ensuring that the correct block of code is executed and addressing the bug that caused the failing tests.
