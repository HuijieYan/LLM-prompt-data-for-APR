To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue of list indexers being treated differently from array-like indexers. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError for list indexers.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional statement that checks the type of the key and handles it accordingly. The condition for handling list indexers is not functioning as expected, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and do not produce a KeyError. We also need to make sure that the behavior is aligned with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and provides consistent behavior for different types of indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have made adjustments to the handling of different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior. We have added additional checks for list and ndarray types to handle them appropriately without causing a KeyError. This fix aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue and provides a solution for the inconsistent behavior in the original function.
