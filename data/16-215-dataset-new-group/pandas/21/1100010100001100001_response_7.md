The buggy function is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there are some issues with the implementation.

Firstly, the function checks the type of the `key` parameter and then determines the `key_type` at runtime. The problem is that after the type of `key` is determined, the subsequent checks and operations do not seem to use this type consistently.

Based on the runtime variable values provided for the cases, it seems that the function is incorrectly determining the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, even though the input `key` can be a list or an ndarray. This is likely due to the inconsistent and redundant checks of `key` type within the function.

To fix the bug, the function should consistently use the `key_type` variable to determine the appropriate operations for different types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key_type is determined consistently, and the subsequent operations use this type to handle the different types of keys for indexing the Series.
