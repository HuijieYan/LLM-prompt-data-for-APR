To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, it is necessary to handle the case when the key is a list or ndarray with an object dtype. In this case, we should return the result of `self.loc[key]`. This will ensure that the correct items from the Series are retrieved when using list or ndarray-like inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the cases for handling list/ndarray inputs have been combined into a single `if` statement. This is done to ensure that when the key is a list or ndarray, the function returns the result of `self.loc[key]`, which was the desired behavior based on the failing test cases.

After making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
