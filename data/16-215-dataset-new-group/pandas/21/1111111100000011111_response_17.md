First, we see that the `_get_with` function checks the type of the `key` parameter and then performs different actions based on the type. The bug may be related to how the function handles the case when `key` is a list-like object.

The bug appears to be caused by how the function handles the case when `key` is a list-like object, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers. This may involve modifying the conditional statements and the actions taken based on the type of the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like objects consistently with array-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like objects are handled consistently with array-like indexers, addressing the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue.
