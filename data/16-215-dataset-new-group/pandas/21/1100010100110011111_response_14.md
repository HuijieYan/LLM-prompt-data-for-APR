The buggy function `_get_with` has several issues that need to be fixed. The function is intended to handle various types of indexers, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, etc. However, there are some inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to failing test cases.

## Bug Analysis
1. The `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` condition is unreachable and should be removed, as a Series does not need to be indexed with DataFrame.
2. The inference of the `key_type` variable is inconsistent for different types of indexers.
3. The handling of boolean indexers is not addressed in the function.

## Bug Cause
The failing test cases are a result of inconsistencies in the handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. In particular, the list indexer is treated differently from other array-like indexers, which leads to the KeyError being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Remove the unreachable condition `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` as it is not necessary.
2. Consistently infer the `key_type` for different types of indexers.
3. Address the handling of boolean indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

## Corrected Function
The corrected version of the function `_get_with` is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        # Handle boolean indexing
        return self._get_values(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, all the failing test cases should pass, and the function should behave consistently for different types of indexers. The unreachable condition has been removed, and the inference of `key_type` has been made consistent. Additionally, boolean indexing has been handled to ensure consistent behavior.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
