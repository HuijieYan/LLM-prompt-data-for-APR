The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic that determines the type of the `key`. The key is being incorrectly classified as a string ('string') when it should be recognized as a list-like or an ndarray in the provided cases. This leads to incorrect handling of the key within the function, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key` needs to be revised. Additionally, the handling of the key based on its type also needs to be improved to ensure that it is processed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        # handling scalar values
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handling list-like objects
        return self.reindex(key)

    # default case, treating as positional indexer
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the key is scalar or list-like and processes it accordingly. Additionally, the default case for handling non-list-like, non-scalar keys has been updated to consider positional indexing based on the index's fallback behavior.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys, ensuring that the key is processed appropriately based on its type.
