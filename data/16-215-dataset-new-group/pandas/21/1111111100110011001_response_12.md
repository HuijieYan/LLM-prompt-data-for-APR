The cause of the bug is that the key_type is being set to 'string' regardless of the input 'key' type. This results in an incorrect error message being raised, as the key_type is being used to determine the type of indexer to use. As a result, the function is not handling the input types correctly, leading to a failure in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the input 'key' type. This can be achieved by using the appropriate functions to determine the type of 'key' and set the key_type accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Infer the type of key and set key_type accordingly
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the input types correctly and pass the failing test cases.
