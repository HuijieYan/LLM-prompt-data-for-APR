The issue is most likely occurring due to the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` within the `_get_with` function, which is trying to index `ser` using the variable `key` (array-like, Iterable, dict, or scalar value). The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not behaving as expected as it does not raise a `KeyError` as it should.

Given the logic of the `_get_with` function and the error message from the failing test, it seems that the bug arises from improper handling of the indexing process when the `key` variable is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series within the `_get_with` function. It's possible that there might be a misinterpretation of the `key` variable, or the error handling may not be optimal for these types.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the logic in the `_get_with` function correctly handles the different types of `key`. It should first determine the type of `key` and then apply indexing operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling different types of `key` has been updated to ensure consistent and correct indexing operations for each type. The specific condition `if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series))` has been added to properly handle these types of `key` by using the `loc` method for indexing. Additionally, the check `if not is_list_like(key)` is retained to handle non-list-like keys, such as scalars.
