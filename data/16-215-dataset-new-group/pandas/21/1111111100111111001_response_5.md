The bug in the given function appears to be related to the incorrect handling of the input parameter `key` of the function `_get_with`. The function is meant to handle different types of keys, such as slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple, and other list-like keys, but the current implementation is not able to handle some of these types correctly, resulting in the failing tests.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly returning the expected result for different types of keys when used as input parameters. Specifically, it seems that the function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, which is not expected. Instead, for each input type, the function should identify the type of the `key` accurately and return the corresponding result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_get_with` to correctly handle different types of keys and return the expected results.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Unsupported key type, use the appropriate type for indexing"
        )
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                "Unsupported key type, use the appropriate type for indexing"
            )
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle different types of keys and raise appropriate exceptions for unsupported types. This should resolve the failing tests and ensure that the function returns the expected results for different input types.
