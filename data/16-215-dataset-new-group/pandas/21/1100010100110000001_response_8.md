The code has a bug that causes it to fail with a KeyError in the given test cases. The bug is present in the `_get_with` method of the Series class in the pandas.core.series module. 

The bug arises because when passing a Series as the key for indexing, the `_get_with` function does not handle it correctly. Instead of checking for a Series, it's checking for an instance of ABCDataFrame and not taking the right corrective action when a Series is passed as 'key'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles a Series as a key for indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Correct the handling of a Series object as the key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = key

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This should fix the bug and resolve the KeyError issues encountered in the failing test cases.
