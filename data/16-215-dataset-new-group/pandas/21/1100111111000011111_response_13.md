The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing it to handle list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior. As per the GitHub issue, the inconsistent behavior is observed when using different indexers, with `ser.loc[key]` raising an error for all cases. The expected behavior is for all cases to behave consistently with the list case.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError for the list case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle all array-like indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected outcome for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Handle all array-like indexers consistently
        key_arr = np.array(key)
        return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

This corrected version ensures that all array-like indexers, including lists, numpy arrays, and pandas Series or Index objects, are handled consistently. This fix should resolve the inconsistencies observed in the behavior of the original `_get_with` function.
