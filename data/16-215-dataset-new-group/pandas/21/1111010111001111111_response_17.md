The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The function does not handle the case of a list indexer properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle all types of indexers consistently. We should make all indexers behave like the list case, ensuring that the function correctly handles all types of indexers without raising errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and no longer raise errors for list indexers. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases.
