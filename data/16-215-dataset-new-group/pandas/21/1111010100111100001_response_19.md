To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that when the key is in the form of a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, it is properly handled. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly inferring the type of the key in these cases.

The bug arises from the use of the `lib.infer_dtype` function and an incorrect type being inferred for the provided keys. In all input cases, the `key_type` variable is being inferred as `'string'` which is incorrect.

This leads to incorrect indexing or reindexing operations, causing the KeyError to be raised when attempting to access the key within the series.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for inferring the key type and ensure that the correct type is identified for indexing or reindexing operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_list_like(key):
            # Inferring the type of a list-like object
            if is_bool(key):
                key_type = 'boolean'
            elif is_integer(key):
                key_type = 'integer'
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            # Inferring the type of a scalar object
            if is_bool(key):
                key_type = 'boolean'
            elif is_integer(key):
                key_type = 'integer'
            else:
                key_type = 'string'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly infer the type of the key by checking if it's list-like and then inferring the appropriate type based on the contents of the key. This ensures that the correct type is used for indexing or reindexing operations, fixing the bug.
