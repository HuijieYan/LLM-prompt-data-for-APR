Based on the above analysis, it seems that the bug is caused by incorrect type checking in the `_get_with` function. The condition check for the type of the `key` is not handling the input properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

It's expected that the function properly handles different types of input for the `key` parameter and based on its type should determine the return value.

Therefore, the bug can be fixed by refining the type checking logic and always returning the expected value corresponding to the input type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Update the condition to check for types properly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other types of inputs, e.g., tuples, Index, etc.
    return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

By updating the type checking and returning the corresponding value for different types of input, we can ensure that the function works as expected for all input cases.
