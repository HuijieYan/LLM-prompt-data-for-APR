The bug in the provided function `_get_with` seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers. The function does not handle list-like indexers properly, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistency.

The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `ser` series. The issue demonstrates that `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError, while the other cases do not. This inconsistency is undesirable and needs to be addressed.

To fix the bug in the function `_get_with`, the handling of list-like indexers should be modified to ensure consistency and proper error handling.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if the key is a scalar using `is_scalar` and handle it accordingly by calling `self.loc[key]`.
- We also check if the key is list-like using `is_list_like` and ensure proper error handling for list-like indexers by calling `self.reindex(key)`.
- For any other unsupported key types, a ValueError is raised to indicate that the key type is not supported.

With these modifications, the corrected function should handle list-like indexers and scalars consistently and provide the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
