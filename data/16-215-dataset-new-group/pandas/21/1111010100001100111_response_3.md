The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the key parameter when it is a list. The code has different behaviors based on the type of the key parameter, leading to inconsistencies and raised errors when using a list indexer.

In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the key_type is identified as a string, which is not the correct type to handle the key parameter. This inconsistency in handling the key types is causing the issue when the key is a list.

Based on the GitHub issue, it is clear that there is inconsistency in the behavior of indexers. The desired behavior is for all types of indexers (array-like, list, index) to be treated consistently.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle all types of indexers uniformly by treating them as a list. This will ensure consistent behavior and prevent errors and inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):  # added condition for ABCSeries
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat all types of indexers as a list
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key parameter is handled uniformly as a list, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
