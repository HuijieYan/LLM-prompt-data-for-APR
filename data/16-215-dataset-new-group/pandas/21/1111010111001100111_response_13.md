One potential error location is the `if not is_list_like(key):` condition, where the bug might be occurring due to the difference in behavior for array-like indexers compared to list indexers.

The bug is caused by the inconsistency in treating different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) in the `_get_with` function. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for all types of indexers, but the function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the treatment of list indexers should be aligned with the behavior of array-like indexers and Index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers by converting them to a list and then inferring the dtype to ensure consistent treatment with other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and make the function behave consistently for all types of indexers, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
