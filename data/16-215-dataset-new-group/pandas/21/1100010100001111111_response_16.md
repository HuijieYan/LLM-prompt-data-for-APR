The issue seems to be related to the behavior of different indexers (list, array-like, Index) when used with a Series. The bug may be related to the treatment of list indexers differently from other types, such as array-like indexers and Index.

Based on the provided information, it seems that when using a list indexer, the function is raising a KeyError for a case where it shouldn't. More specifically, the function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers and Index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type in ["boolean", "string"]:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers by converting the key to an Index using `ensure_index`. This ensures that list indexers are treated in the same way as other types of indexers. Additionally, the key_type check has been updated to properly handle different types of keys.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure consistent behavior when using different types of indexers with the Series.
