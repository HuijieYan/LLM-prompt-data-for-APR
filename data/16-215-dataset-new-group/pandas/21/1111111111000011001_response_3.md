To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of the `key` variable and its type. The function currently checks the type of `key` and then assigns a new value to it, potentially overwriting the original value. This causes incorrect behavior and results in a KeyError when using `ser[key]` in the test function.

We need to ensure that the original `key` value is preserved and not overwritten. Additionally, the key_type is incorrectly assigned and inferred. We need to accurately determine the type of `key` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the original value of `key` is not overwritten and accurately determine the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the test function `test_getitem_no_matches` passes successfully.
