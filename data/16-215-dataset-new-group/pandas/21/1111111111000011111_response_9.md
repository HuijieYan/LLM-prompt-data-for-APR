The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by a discrepancy in how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. This causes an inconsistency in behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. 

To fix the bug, the function should treat all types of indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is the same regardless of whether the indexer is a list, array-like, or a pandas Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Always convert key to a list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)

    if key_type in ("integer", "floating"):
        # Always use positional indexing
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By converting all types of indexers to a list before processing them, the function now treats all indexers consistently and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
