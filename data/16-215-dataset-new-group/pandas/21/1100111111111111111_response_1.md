The issue appears to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when using a list as the key. The reported behavior seems unexpected and inconsistent with how array-like indexers are handled.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to ensure that all indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if not already list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of indexers consistently, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report and ensuring it passes the failing tests.
