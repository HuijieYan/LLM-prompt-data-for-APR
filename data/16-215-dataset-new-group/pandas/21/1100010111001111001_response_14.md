The bug in the given function lies in the conditional check for the `key_type` variable. The function incorrectly identifies that the `key_type` is `'integer'` and tries to return the positional indexer. This leads to a KeyError in cases where the key is not found in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and determine the correct `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # checking for list-like, scalars, etc.
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    if is_scalar(key) or is_index(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the specific conditional checks for `key_type` and used the `is_scalar` and `is_index` functions to handle scalars and indexing cases. We have also handled the list-like objects using `is_list_like` and used `reindex` where necessary.

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle different types of keys and avoid the KeyError that occurred in the buggy version.
