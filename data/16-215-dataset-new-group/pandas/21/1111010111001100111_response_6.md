The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers. The failing test indicates that the function is not treating list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError in one specific case.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the conditional checks for different types of indexers and the logic that follows. Specifically, the bug may be related to the handling of list-like indexers and the corresponding inference of `key_type`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks for handling different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handling list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Update this condition to handle list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, list) or key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers consistently and should pass the failing test case. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the inconsistent behavior of different indexers.
