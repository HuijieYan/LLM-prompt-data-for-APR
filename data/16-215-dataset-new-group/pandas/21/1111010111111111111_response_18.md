The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled in the `Series` class. The failing tests indicate that using a list as an indexer results in a `KeyError` while other types of indexers do not.

The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be the cause of this inconsistency as it contains conditionals for different types of indexers but may not handle the list indexer correctly.

To resolve this issue, the bug in the `_get_with` function needs to be fixed. Specifically, the conditional block for handling list indexers may need to be revised to align with the behavior of other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been unified with the handling of numpy arrays. This should address the inconsistency and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
