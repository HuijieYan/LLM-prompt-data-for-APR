Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from how different indexers are treated, specifically with list indexers. The function should handle the list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

The bug appears to be occurring because when the input `key` is a list, it is not being handled correctly. The function needs to ensure that it treats list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. 

To address this bug, the function can be updated to handle list indexers in a manner consistent with how other indexers are handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, addressing the issue identified in the GitHub post.
