To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the key_type determination and the branching logic based on the type of key.

The bug seems to be in the section where the key_type is determined, as it always seems to evaluate to "string". This is likely due to the implementation of the `lib.infer_dtype` function in the `if key_type == 'integer'` section.

To fix the bug, we need to review the `lib.infer_dtype` function and ensure that it correctly identifies the type of the key. It's also important to note that the logic for handling different key types should cover all possible types and handle them appropriately in the respective branches.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case where key is an array
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = 'integer' if is_integer(key[0]) else 'string'
    else:
        key_type = 'string' if is_scalar(key) else 'sequence'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "sequence":
        return self.loc[key].reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")

```

In this corrected version, we first handle the case where the key is an array and determine the key_type based on the type of the array elements. Then, based on the key_type, we branch into appropriate logic for handling the key. This should address the issues seen in the failing cases.
