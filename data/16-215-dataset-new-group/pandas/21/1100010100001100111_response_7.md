The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, especially when it comes to lists. The issue mentioned in the GitHub report also suggests that there's an inconsistency in how different indexers are treated and that the behavior does not match across all cases.

The buggy function appears to incorrectly identify the type of the indexer when it is a list. This leads to an incorrect method of indexing being chosen, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors. The function should uniformly handle different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior across all cases.

To fix the bug, we'll need to update the logic for handling different indexer types, especially when it comes to lists, arrays, and indices.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/series.py

def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the redundant checks and consolidated the handling of different indexer types. We no longer convert list-like indexers to lists, and instead directly use them for indexing. Additionally, we have updated the logic to handle string indexers appropriately.

By making these changes, the function should now produce consistent results across different types of indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
