The function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is intended to handle different types of keys when getting items from a Series, but it has several issues that cause it to fail.

The test function `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` fails because when a key of type `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series` is passed, the function does not handle it properly and raises a `KeyError`.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` may not be sufficient to handle different types of keys.
2. The handling of different key types and conversions using `isinstance` and `type checks` may be inefficient and error-prone.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle all the different types of keys properly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised when certain key types are used.

To fix the bug, a more comprehensive approach is needed for handling different types of keys. Instead of using individual `isinstance` checks for each type of key, a single consistent approach for treating keys should be implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported"
        )
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Index)):
            if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the function handles different key types in a more consistent and comprehensive manner, using nested conditional checks. This approach ensures that the appropriate action is taken for each type of key, resolving the issues present in the original buggy function.
