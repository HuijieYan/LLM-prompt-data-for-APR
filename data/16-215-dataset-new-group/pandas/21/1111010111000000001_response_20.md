Strategy to fix the bug:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of the 'key' in the '_get_with' function. It is not being handled properly for certain data types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to access a non-existent index from the Series object. To fix this, the 'key' needs to be properly handled for different data types.

Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.dtype.kind in ["i", "u", "f"]:
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self._get_values(key)
```
