The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list as compared to array-like indexers such as `pd.Index(key)` or `np.array(key)`. The failing test demonstrates this inconsistency and points to a KeyError for the list case, which is not expected.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the `key_type` is being inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which may indicate an issue with key inference when the key is a list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of the function is consistent across different types of indexers and that the key inference mechanism works as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:  # Updated condition to include 'boolean' as well
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # Handle the rest of the cases
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with unsupported type, use appropriate indexers"
        )
```

This corrected version includes additional checks for key types to ensure proper handling of different types of indexers. It also addresses the inconsistency in key inference and provides a more comprehensive approach to handle different indexers.
