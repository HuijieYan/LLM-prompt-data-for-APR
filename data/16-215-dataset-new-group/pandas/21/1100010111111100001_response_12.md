The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle keys of type `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, or `Series` properly. It tries to infer the type of the key using the `lib.infer_dtype` method, which incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'` in all cases.

To fix this bug, we need to identify the type of the key correctly and handle each type separately, ensuring that the indexing operation is performed appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle list, np.array, Index, and Series separately
    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the keys of types `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, and `Series` separately by directly using `self.loc[key]` for these types, and otherwise falling back to `self.reindex(key)`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
