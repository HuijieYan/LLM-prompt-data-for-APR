The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in an inconsistency in behavior. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a `KeyError` for the `list` case while the other cases do not raise this error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing a `KeyError` to be raised specifically for the list case. This inconsistency in behavior is highlighted in the GitHub issue where the behavior for `ser.loc[key]` differs from the behavior of `ser[key]` for the list case.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers consistently with array-like indexers. This could involve removing the specific check for list indexers and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across different types of key indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_bool(key):
        key = list(key)

    if self.index.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function treats list indexers consistently with array-like indexers and should resolve the inconsistency in behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.
