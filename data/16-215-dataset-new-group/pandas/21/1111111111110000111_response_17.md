The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when indexing with a list that contains no matches. This issue was raised in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The cause of the bug is due to the discrepancy in how different types of indexers (array-like, Index, and list) are handled in the `_get_with` function. The failing test case, `test_getitem_no_matches`, demonstrates this discrepancy and leads to a KeyError when a list indexer contains no matches.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers, such as array-like and Index indexers, to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of data structures.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Use loc for scalar or non-list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already
    key = list(key)

    # Use loc if the key is a scalar, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Reindex for other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers is made consistent, ensuring that the function correctly handles list indexers when there are no matches.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
