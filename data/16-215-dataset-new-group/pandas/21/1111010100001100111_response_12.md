The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the inconsistent behavior in handling different indexers (list, array-like, index). The GitHub issue further confirms the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling indexers consistently, leading to unexpected errors or behaviors in some cases, especially when using a list indexer. It seems that the function is not properly identifying the type of the key, leading to incorrect handling in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle all types of indexers (list, array-like, index) consistently and accurately. This can be achieved by checking the type of the key and then performing the appropriate actions based on its type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified and then handle it accordingly. This approach should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and address the issue reported on GitHub.
