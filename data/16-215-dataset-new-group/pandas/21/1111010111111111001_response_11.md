The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the conditional block that determines the type of the `key` parameter and how to process it. The `key` parameter can be of different types, such as list, np.array, Index, or Series, and the function uses conditional statements to handle each type accordingly.

Based on the failing tests and the input/output values, it appears that the bug might be related to how the function handles a key of type `Index` or a list-like object. The key type is inferred based on its value, and based on that type, certain operations are performed. However, there seems to be inconsistency in handling the different types of keys.

To fix the bug, the function should provide consistent handling for different types of keys and ensure that the inferred key type is properly identified and processed according to the logic specific to its type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all types of key that are list-like
    key = list(key)
  
    # Perform operations based on the type of key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
  
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures that all types of key are processed consistently, resolving any inconsistencies in handling different key types. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
