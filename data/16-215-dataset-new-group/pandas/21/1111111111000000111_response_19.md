The buggy function `_get_with` is causing an issue when using a list as an indexer for a Series. This is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled, and it's also inconsistent with the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` for all 4 cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the list case in the same way as other array-like indexers. This is evident from the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` where a KeyError is raised specifically for the list case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list case in the same way as other array-like indexers to maintain consistency in behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the list case and other array-like indexers in the same way
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the list case in the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing test. The correction maintains consistency with the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` for all 4 cases, as well as addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
