The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug related to the indexing of a Series using a list key. It incorrectly handles the list indexers differently from other array-like indexers.

The bug causes inconsistencies in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys, resulting in unexpected errors being raised for list indexers but not for other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers needs to be made consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers. This will ensure that the behavior is uniform and that errors are raised consistently across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, ensuring that errors will be raised uniformly for different types of indexers.

This correction will resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the behavior is consistent across all types of indexers.
