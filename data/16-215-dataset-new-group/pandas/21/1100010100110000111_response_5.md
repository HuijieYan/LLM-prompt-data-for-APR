The bug occurs within the `_get_with` function, specifically in the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` block. This block incorrectly assumes that `key` is a list, while the failing test indicates that this assumption is not always true. The error message from the failing test indicates that there's inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, and `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles different types of indexers consistently. We should avoid assuming that the `key` is always a list, and instead handle it based on its true type.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `key` is list-like. If it is, we infer its type using `lib.infer_dtype`. If it's an array-like type, we directly infer its type without converting it to a list. Then, we handle the `integer` and `boolean` cases accordingly. This modification ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
