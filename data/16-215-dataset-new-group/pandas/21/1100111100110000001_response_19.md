The bug appears to be in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, specifically in the section where it is trying to handle different data types for the `key` parameter. The bug is causing failing tests with a `KeyError` when trying to call the `ser[key]`.

The issue arises when trying to use different types as `key` such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The bug is causing the DataFrame to fail at the type checks in `_get_with` and raise a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should correctly handle different types for the `key` parameter and return the appropriate output without raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I modified the condition to handle different types for the `key` parameter. I also removed unnecessary type checks for `Index` or `key` as it was redundant and causing errors in the previous implementation.

With the corrected version, the failing tests should pass successfully without raising a `KeyError`.
