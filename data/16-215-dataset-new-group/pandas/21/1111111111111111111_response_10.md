Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies with how the function `_get_with` is handling different types of indexers. The GitHub issue also suggests that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

The key problem is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, which leads to a `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in a consistent way with other array-like indexers. This may involve updating the logic for handling different types of indexers to ensure that all types are treated consistently.

Below is the corrected version of the function `_get_with` based on the analysis:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handle the case of list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes handling list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and ensures that all types of indexers are treated in a predictable and reliable manner.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The GitHub issue regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers should also be resolved with this fix.
