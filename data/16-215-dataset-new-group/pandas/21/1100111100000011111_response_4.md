## The bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to different behavior when using different types of indexers, resulting in unexpected errors and incorrect results.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for list indexers and array-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating how the function handles different types of indexers and ensuring that the appropriate indexer type is used in all cases.

## The corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Validate if key is a list-like indexer
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Use iloc for positional indexer
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # Use loc for label-based indexer
        return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as above, we ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers, thus addressing the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue. This correction aligns the behavior of the function with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
