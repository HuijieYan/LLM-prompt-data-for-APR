The bug in the given function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys correctly and return the result accordingly. However, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, leading to an error when trying to access a non-existent key from the series.

The key issue in the code is how the function is handling different types of keys. It incorrectly identifies the `key_type` and does not handle certain key types correctly, resulting in the KeyError during the test execution.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should properly identify the type of the key and handle each type accordingly, ensuring that the correct method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used for indexing.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified and handle different types of keys accordingly. This should prevent the KeyError during the test execution and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of keys.
