The bug results in the function throwing unexpected errors when it is executed. The function is supposed to return a series of values based on the key input. However, it is not handling the different potential types of the key input (list, series, and index). Instead of returning the expected result, it results in errors such as KeyError and TypeError.

The first issue is with assigning arbitrary randomness to the key, which would cause an inappropriate response from the system. We can resolve it by passing a machine-generated and appropriate key to the function. Additionally, we need to handle different input types (list, series, and index) correctly to avoid unexpected errors. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Case 1: slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Case 2: DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    # Case 3: Tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # All other cases
    return self.loc[key]
```
