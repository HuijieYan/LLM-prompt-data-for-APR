The issue stems from the inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as the indexer. The last case, returning `self.loc[key]`, should be handling all types of key, but it's not. The error message from the failing test also indicates that there is an issue with the list indexer. The bug may be related to the way the function is handling the list indexer differently from other types.

The bug should be fixed by ensuring that the function handles the list indexer in the same way it handles other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling the list indexer in the same way as the other types of indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue.
