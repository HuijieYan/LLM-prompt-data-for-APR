First, let's analyze the buggy function and the error message. The function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in Pandas, which handles the indexing for the `Series` object. The error message indicates that there is an issue when indexing a `Series` with a list, ndarray, Index, or another `Series`.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, particularly when it receives a list-like indexer. It may be incorrectly treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

Based on the information from the failing tests, the cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like indexers correctly and may raise a KeyError in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently, ensuring that it behaves the same way for list, ndarray, Index, and Series input types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, after checking if the input `key` is list-like, it is converted to a list if it is not already. Then, the function continues handling the list indexers consistent with other array-like indexers, ensuring a uniform behavior for all types of input.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.
