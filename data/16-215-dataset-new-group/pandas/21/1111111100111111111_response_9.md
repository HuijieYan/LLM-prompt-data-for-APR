To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the pandas module. The bug arises from the different behaviors when indexing with a list compared to indexing with an array-like indexer such as a numpy array or a pandas Index.

The cause of the bug is that when indexing with a list, the function raises a KeyError with a specific message, but when indexing with other array-like types, the behavior is different.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers by checking the type of the indexer before processing it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks for the type of the `key` parameter, and if it is a DataFrame, an Index, or a numpy array, it uses the `reindex` method. If it is not list-like, it uses the `loc` method to handle scalar values, and for all other cases, it also uses the `reindex` method.

With this correction, the function should now handle indexing consistently for all array-like indexers, and the failing test cases should pass.
