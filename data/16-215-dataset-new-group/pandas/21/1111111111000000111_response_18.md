The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different indexers are handled, especially when a list indexer is used. This bug causes inconsistent behavior in how different indexers are treated, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

One potential error location is in the block of code that handles list-like indexers, as it tries to handle different types of indexers and might not be correctly identifying the type of the indexer.

The bug seems to be caused by inconsistencies in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to incorrect behavior for list indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` which expects consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers aligns with the behavior of other indexers like numpy arrays, Pandas series, and Index objects. Additionally, we need to address the inconsistency in handling list indexers when compared to other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Consistently handle different types of indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `key` input is converted to an index using `ensure_index`, and we consistently handle the different types of indexers, including the special case for list indexers. This should address the inconsistent behavior and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
