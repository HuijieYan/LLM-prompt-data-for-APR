The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional statement to handle non-list-like keys. The function fails to handle a list-like key correctly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access the index. The cause of the bug can be identified using the failing tests and the GitHub issue, where the different behaviors for various indexers are compared.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like keys, and handle them appropriately to avoid KeyError when accessing the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that both list-like and non-list-like keys are handled consistently, addressing the inconsistent behavior identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue. It attempts to access the index using `self.loc[key]` for list-like keys and falls back to `self.reindex(key)` if a KeyError occurs.
