The bug in the _get_with function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The bug is most likely in the section of code where the type of the key is being determined and handled.

The cause of the bug can be identified by examining the runtime input/output variable values:
- In all the test cases, the key_type is being incorrectly identified as 'string' instead of being inferred based on the actual type of the key, which leads to inconsistent behavior and potentially incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the actual type of the key. We should also consider the different types of indexers being used and handle them consistently to avoid the inconsistency in behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        # If the key is a scalar, use self.loc for label-based indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # For array-like indexers, use reindex to handle all cases consistently
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By using the is_scalar function to check for scalar values and then performing label-based indexing with self.loc, we can ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers. For array-like indexers, we handle them using reindex to ensure that the key_type is inferred correctly based on the actual type of the key.

This correction should address the inconsistency and potential errors in the original function.
