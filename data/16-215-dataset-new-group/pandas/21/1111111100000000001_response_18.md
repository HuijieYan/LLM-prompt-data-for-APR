The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The condition `if not is_list_like` is incorrect, as it should be checking for scalar values. The wrong approach can lead to incorrect indexing.
2. The condition `if isinstance(key, list)` is incorrect and should be removed, as it can cause incorrect indexing.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not properly handling the input parameter 'key'. The type of the key is being incorrectly inferred and leads to improper indexing due to incorrect condition checks.

The following strategy can be used to fix the bug:
1. Correctly identify if the key is a scalar, list-like, tuple, DataFrame, or other type.
2. Handle each case explicitly and perform the indexing operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
            
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
            
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, Index) else key
            key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
                    
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, scalar values are explicitly checked and indexed using `self.loc[key]`. The unnecessary condition `if isinstance(key, list)` has been removed. The key type is correctly identified and indexed accordingly.
