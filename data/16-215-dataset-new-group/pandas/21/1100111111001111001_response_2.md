Based on the analysis, the bug appears to be caused by an issue with the handling of string keys in the _get_with function when the key is type list or ndarray. The incorrect key_type is leading to unexpected behavior for string keys.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for determining the key_type for string keys. We can identify the key_type by checking the type of the first element of the key when the key is a list or ndarray.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # For list or ndarray, check the type of the first element
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) and key and isinstance(key[0], str):
        key_type = "string"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the check for the type of the first element when the key is a list or ndarray, and sets the key_type to "string" accordingly. This should address the issue where the key_type was incorrectly being set to "integer" for string keys in certain cases.
