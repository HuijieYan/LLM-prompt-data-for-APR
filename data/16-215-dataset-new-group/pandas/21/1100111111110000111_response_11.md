The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the file `pandas/core/series.py`. The function fails to handle the case where a list-like key has no matches in the index.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` demonstrates that when a list indexers is used, an error is raised due to no matches in the index, while array-like indexers do not raise such an error.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. It points out that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases, and suggests that the behavior of array-like indexers should be similar to that of list indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexers and array-like key indexers consistently, following the expected behavior shown in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. 

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like or array-like key indexers
    if not is_list_like(key) or not any(self.index.isin(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # Handle array-like key indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle scalar key indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_get_with` function will now handle list and array-like key indexers consistently, and the corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
