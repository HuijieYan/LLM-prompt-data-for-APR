The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles certain types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when attempting to access elements that are not present in the index. This inconsistency causes the test cases to fail.

The bug occurs in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block, which does not handle indexers correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior and error messages in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to handle all types of indexers consistently and ensure that the function returns the expected values and types for the given inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now handles all types of indexers consistently and should pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
