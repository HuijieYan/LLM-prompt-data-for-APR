The bug in the function `_get_with` causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches". The issue points out that there is inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers, where a list indexer raises an error while other types of indexers do not.

The cause of the bug is the conditional statements that check the type of the `key` parameter. The function does not handle list-like indexers properly, leading to the KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. It should also ensure that the behavior is aligned with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the case where none of the index elements are found
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly handles list-like indexers by attempting to access the elements using `self.loc[key]`. If a KeyError is raised, it re-raises the exception with a more informative message, aligning with the behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should now behave consistently when indexing a Series with different types of indexers and satisfy the expected input/output values.
