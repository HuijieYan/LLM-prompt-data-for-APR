To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers. This means ensuring that the function correctly handles list indexers to avoid raising a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index.

The cause of the bug in the current `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The code logic incorrectly raises a `KeyError` when using a list indexer, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers, such as arrays, Indices, and Series. This will involve updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that list indexers are processed correctly and do not trigger a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, we ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently and does not raise a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index. This corrected version of the function addresses the inconsistency in behavior and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
