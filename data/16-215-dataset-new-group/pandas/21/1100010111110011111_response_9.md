## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with {} is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate Series or Index".format(type(key).__name__)
        )
```

The buggy function incorrectly handled the case when the key was a list, resulting in an inconsistency in behavior. The corrected version of the function simplifies the handling of different key types and ensures a consistent approach is used for all input types. It also raises a TypeError when an unsupported key type is provided.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported on GitHub by providing a more consistent and predictable behavior for different types of indexers.
