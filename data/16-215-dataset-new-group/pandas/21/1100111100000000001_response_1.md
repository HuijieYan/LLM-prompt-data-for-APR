The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of the `key` parameter. The code checks the type of `key` and then proceeds to perform different actions based on its type. The issue seems to be with the logic for processing the different types of keys. The bug is causing the `_get_with` function to not correctly handle the different types of keys, which would lead to unexpected behavior or errors when using this function.

To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to revise the logic for handling the different types of keys to ensure that the function behaves as expected for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.infer_dtype()
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self._is_certain_index_type:
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the logic to handle different types of keys. We have used the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to correctly process scalar and list-like keys, and used the `infer_dtype` function to determine the key type and perform the appropriate indexing based on that type.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle the different types of keys correctly and avoid the issues present in the original buggy function.
