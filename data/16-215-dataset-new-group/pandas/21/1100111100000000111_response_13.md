The issue seems to revolve around the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used with the `Series` class. The bug appears to cause inconsistencies in the behavior when attempting to access a `Series` with a list index that has no matches. The bug seems to be related to the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.

Based on the given code, it seems that the bug could be occurring due to the handling of list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. The behavior is inconsistent and seems to result in an error when attempting to access a `Series` with a list index containing no matches.

To fix this bug, we can modify the handling of list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior. We can modify the condition for list-like indexers and handle the case where there are no matches in a way that avoids raising errors. This will align the behavior of list-like indexers with array-like indexers and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers with no matches
    try:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex([])
``` 

In the corrected version, we added a try-except block to handle the case of list-like indexers with no matches. If a `KeyError` is raised when attempting to `reindex` with the key, we catch the exception and reindex with an empty list to avoid the error.

This should ensure consistent behavior for all indexers, and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
