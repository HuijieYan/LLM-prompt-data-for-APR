The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of key types, specifically when the key is a list. The function wrongly assumes that the key will be a list-like type, but it does not handle it correctly when it is actually a list.

The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types, leading to KeyError in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, you can modify the condition that checks for list-like types and handle lists separately. Additionally, the handling of key types should be more robust to avoid unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key = [k for k in key if k in self.index]
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, when the key is a list, we filter out the elements that are not in the index before passing it to `self.loc[key]`, preventing the KeyError that was occurring previously. Additionally, the conditions for handling different key types have been rearranged and made more explicit to cover all cases and provide the expected behavior.
