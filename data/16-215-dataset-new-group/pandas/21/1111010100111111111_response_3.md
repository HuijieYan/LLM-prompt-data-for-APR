The issue seems to stem from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, particularly in how it handles different types of indexers. The failing tests indicate that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the conditional statement that checks for list-like indexers. It appears that for list indexers, the code is attempting to return `self.reindex(key)`, which is likely leading to the `KeyError` due to incorrect handling of the index values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            key_type = "string"  # Assuming the remaining cases are string-like

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers and should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub thread. It also ensures that the behavior aligns with other types of indexers, improving the overall consistency of the function.
