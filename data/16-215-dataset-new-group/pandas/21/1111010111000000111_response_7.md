The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class, where a KeyError is being raised for the list case when the key does not match any index values. This behavior is inconsistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers like `pd.Index` and `np.array`.

The bug results in a KeyError being raised when using a list as the key to access elements from the `Series` object, even if the key does not match any index values.

To fix the bug, the KeyError needs to be handled differently for the list case within the `_get_with` function to ensure consistency in behavior with other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `KeyError` handling for the list case has been removed and replaced with a call to `self.reindex(key)` to ensure consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.
