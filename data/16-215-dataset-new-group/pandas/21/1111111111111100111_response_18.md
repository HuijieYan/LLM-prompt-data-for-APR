## Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series.

The issue arises when a list-like key is passed to the function. The function then checks the type of the key, and if it is not recognized as a specific type (such as an integer, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index), it attempts to reindex the Series using the key. However, the reindexing process fails to handle list-like keys properly, resulting in a KeyError.

Additionally, the behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects, which do not result in a KeyError.

## Bug fix strategy

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like keys properly. It should first check the type of the key and then branch into the appropriate processing logic for list-like keys. This logic should include handling the list-like key in a manner consistent with other types of indexers.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = "object"

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "object":
        # handle the list-like key
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional logic to handle the list-like key type specifically and ensure that its behavior is consistent with other types of indexers.

This should resolve the issue and fix the bug in the `_get_with` function.
