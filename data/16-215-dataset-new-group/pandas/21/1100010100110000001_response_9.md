The bug arises from the `_get_with` function's handling of various types of keys provided for indexing. Specifically, the function does not handle the key type of `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series` correctly. It's not explicitly returning the expected KeyError as part of the reindexing process for these key types, leading to test failures.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle these key types explicitly and ensure that they are compatible with the indexing process. Subsequently, it's important to add explicit checks and correct return statements to handle different types of keys to avoid raising errors and failing the tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        # check if scalar value
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        try:
            return self.reindex(key)
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}") from e

    elif is_bool(key):
        # handling boolean indexer
        return self[self.index.to_series().reindex(key).isna()]

    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
        # handle categorical indexing
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

I've added detailed checks and handling for each type of key, ensuring that the function correctly reindexes the specified key and raises a KeyError if the reindexing fails. This updated version should fix the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass successfully.
