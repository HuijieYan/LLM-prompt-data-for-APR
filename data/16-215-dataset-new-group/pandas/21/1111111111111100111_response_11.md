To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class and make sure it handles list-like indexers consistently.

The issue stems from inconsistent behavior when accessing a `Series` using different types of indexers (e.g., a list, an array, or a `pd.Index`). The current implementation of the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like indexers consistently, leading to a `KeyError` in some cases.

We can address this inconsistency by modifying the logic inside the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner. Specifically, we need to ensure that all types of indexers produce the same result when accessing the `Series`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now treats list-like indexers consistently and should produce the expected results in all cases.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that accessing a `Series` with different types of indexers produces consistent outcomes.
