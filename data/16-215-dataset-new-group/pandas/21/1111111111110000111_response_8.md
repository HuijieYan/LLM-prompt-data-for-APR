The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError when trying to access a Series with a list-like object. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers such as pd.Index and np.array. The bug is also raised as an issue on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in different behaviors. This causes the KeyError when trying to access a Series with list indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function so that it treats all indexers consistently, whether they are list, np.ndarray, or pd.Index. The corrected version of the function should handle all types of indexers in a uniform manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index if not already
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes made to the function involve using `ensure_index` to convert the key to an Index if it's not already, and then calling `self.reindex(key)` at the end to handle all types of indexers uniformly.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
