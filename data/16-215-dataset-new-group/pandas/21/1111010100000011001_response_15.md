The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the key_type assignment when the key is a list. The bug is likely to result in incorrect type inference for the key_type, causing unexpected behavior in the subsequent conditional statements and returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the key_type is properly inferred for all types of inputs, including lists. We can achieve this by moving the inference logic to the beginning of the function and handling the various input types explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = None
    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the key is a scalar, list, or other supported types. We also ensure that the key_type is inferred accurately for all types of inputs. This should prevent the incorrect type inference and ensure that the function returns the expected results for all input cases provided.
