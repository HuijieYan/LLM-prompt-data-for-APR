The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the key input. The function is unable to handle the key properly when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series object. It results in the KeyError exception when trying to retrieve the value from the Series.

The runtime input/output values and types for each case show that the `key_type` is identified as `'string'` for all cases, which indicates that the key is being incorrectly processed as a string rather than a list, ndarray, or Index.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should handle different data types of the key input appropriately, especially when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. It should also correctly infer the `key_type` based on the type of the input key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # treat scalars as positional indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the different data types of the key input by using the `is_list_like` and `is_integer` functions to appropriately determine the type of the key. Additionally, it ensures that the key is processed correctly based on its type to avoid the KeyError exception.
