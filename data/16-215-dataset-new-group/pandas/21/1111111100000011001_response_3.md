## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys and return the corresponding values. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including incorrect handling of the key type and the determination of `key_type`. The type of the inferred key (`key_type`) is crucial for the correct functioning of the function.

### Potential Errors
1. Incorrect handling of the key type, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrect determination of `key_type` may result in wrong branching conditions.

### Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling and determination of the key type (`key_type`). This can lead to an incorrect branch being taken, resulting in unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to reconsider the method of handling the key type and ensure that the correct type is being inferred for the key. Additionally, proper branching conditions need to be set based on the type of the key.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling and determination of the key type have been revised to ensure that the correct type is being inferred for the key. Proper branching conditions have been set based on the type of the key to avoid unexpected results. This should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
