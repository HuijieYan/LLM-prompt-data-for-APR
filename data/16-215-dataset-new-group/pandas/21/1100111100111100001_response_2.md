The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. Based on the error messages, it seems that the function is not properly handling certain types of input, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

The function checks if the `key` is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or not list-like, and then performs some operations based on these conditions. However, the handling of the `key` and its type in each condition might be incorrect, leading to the `KeyError`.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key`. This could be due to inconsistencies in how the `key` is being passed to the function or how its type is being inferred within the function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` and handles it appropriately in each condition.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, PDIndex)):
        if isinstance(key, PDIndex):
            indexer = key
        else:
            indexer = key
            if isinstance(indexer, list):
                indexer = np.array(indexer)
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(indexer)

        # Here key_type is the final inferred type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the type of `key` is handled consistently and appropriately in each condition, avoiding the potential for a `KeyError` to be raised due to an incorrect type inference. This should address the issues reported in the failing test cases.
