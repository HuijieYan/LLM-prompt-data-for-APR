The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling all possible cases for the input `key`, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where using a list as an indexer raises an error, while other types of indexers do not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle all possible cases for the input `key` and ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when `key` is a list, array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index by returning the result of `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the issue of inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
