## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers and perform the corresponding operations. However, the issue arises when a list-like indexer is used, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` being raised for list-like indexers, while other indexers do not result in this error. The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to the inconsistent behavior and the `KeyError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. By handling list-like indexers in a manner that aligns with the behavior of other indexers, the `KeyError` issue can be resolved.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug related to inconsistent behavior for list-like indexers can be resolved. This corrected version should now handle list-like indexers in a manner consistent with other types of indexers, effectively addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
