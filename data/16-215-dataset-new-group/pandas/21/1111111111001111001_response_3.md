The bug in the given function is likely causing an incorrect type to be assigned to the variable `key_type`, which is leading to the failing tests. The key type should be inferred based on the input, and this inferred type should determine the behavior of the function.

Based on the analysis of the failing tests and expected input/output values, it seems that the inferred key type `key_type` should be based on the input `key`, rather than being set to the string `'string'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred and used to determine the appropriate behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        # The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, `key_type` is properly inferred based on the input `key` and used to determine the behavior of the function. The correction should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
