## Analysis
The function `_get_with` is meant to handle various types of indexing for a pandas series, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and reindexing. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, such as the incorrect handling of the `is_list_like` condition, the mishandling of key types, and the ambiguity in the logic flow.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the mishandling of different types of keys for indexing. The conditions for checking the key types and the corresponding actions to be taken are not well-defined, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Refactor the logic for handling different key types, ensuring that each type is properly identified and processed.
- Define clear conditions for each key type and the corresponding action to be taken.
- Ensure that edge cases and unexpected input types are accounted for.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # handle dataframe
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    # handle tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle scalar or non-list-like key
    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other cases
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

        if is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In the bug-fixed version, the logic is refactored to handle different cases for indexing keys, ensuring that each type is properly identified and processed. The conditions for each key type are well-defined, and the handling of edge cases and unexpected input types is improved.
