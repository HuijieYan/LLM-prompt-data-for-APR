## The potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `isinstance(key, Index)` check may not be handling the type of `key` correctly and causing unexpected behavior.
2. The handling of the `key_type` variable may not be distinguishing between different types of keys correctly, leading to unexpected results.

## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `Series` class. Specifically, the `list` indexer is being treated differently from other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and failure of the test cases.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This may involve revisiting the logic for determining the type of indexer and handling it appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or (is_object_dtype(key) and is_list_like(key)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the distinction between different types of indexers and ensured consistent behavior for handling them. This should resolve the inconsistent handling of indexers and fix the failing test cases.
