The bug in the function `_get_with` occurs while determining the type of the `key`. This results in the incorrect handling of the input and leads to a KeyError, as observed in the failing test. The issue arises from the logic used to determine the type of the `key` and its subsequent processing within the function.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to simplify the logic for determining the `key` type and its handling within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the type of the `key` has been simplified and improved to correctly handle both scalar and non-scalar input values.

This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
