The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be causing a KeyError when indexing a Series with a list that has no matches in the index. The issue is related to the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in pandas.

The cause of the bug appears to be the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. When a list indexer has no matches in the index, a KeyError is raised, whereas array-like indexers do not raise a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent and is causing issues with the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers. The function should not raise a KeyError when a list indexer has no matches in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not key:
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the case where `key` is a list and has no matches in the index by returning an empty Series instead of raising a KeyError. This behavior is consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
