The issue with the buggy function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, and the particular case of `ser[list(key)]` throws a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior of the other cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistency in how different types of indexers are treated, so they all behave in a similar way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer" or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub by ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
