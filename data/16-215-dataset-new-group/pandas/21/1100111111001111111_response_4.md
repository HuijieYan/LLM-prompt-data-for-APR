Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, and the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, it appears that the bug is caused by the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.

The GitHub issue also confirms this inconsistency and suggests that all indexers should behave the same way to maintain consistency.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to treat all indexers in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed-integer"):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers has been made consistent to address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as the GitHub issue.
