The issue appears to be related to inconsistent behavior in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The bug causes the function to not handle certain input types correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The potential error may lie in the conditionals used to determine the type of key and how it should be handled. Additionally, the type inference for the key may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect handling.

The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function does not uniformly handle indexers of different types, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent results.

To fix the bug, the function should first determine the type of the key and then handle it consistently based on its type. Additionally, the type inference for the key should be improved to ensure correct handling.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to list if it's not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index type

    key_type = key.inferred_type  # Get inferred type of the key

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle all other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version first ensures that the key is in the correct format (as an Index type) and then infers its type for proper handling. Additionally, it handles all cases by reindexing, ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
