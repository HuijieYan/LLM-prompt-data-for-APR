The issue seems to stem from how list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers in the Series index. The failing test cases indicate that when using a list key to index a Series, a KeyError is raised, while array-like indexers do not raise a KeyError.

Upon analyzing the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the bug might be related to how the key type is inferred and processed.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for handling list-like key types in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like key types uniformly by using `self.loc[key]`. This will ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
