The issue seems to be related to handling different types of indexers and the inconsistency in how they are treated in the `Series` class of the pandas library. The problem arises when using a list indexer, as it doesn't behave consistently with other types of indexers.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs when a list key is used for indexing in the `Series` class. The `is_list_like` check is not properly handling the list key, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve properly handling the list key when performing the indexing operation. This would require validating the list key and ensuring that it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not any(index in self.index for index in key):
            return self.reindex(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if any index in the list key is not present in the series index. If so, it returns the result of reindexing the key. This should resolve the inconsistency issue when using a list key for indexing in the `Series` class of the pandas library.
