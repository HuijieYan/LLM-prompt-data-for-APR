The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers. The function fails to handle list indexers properly, leading to inconsistent behavior with array-like indexers. The issue reported on GitHub discusses the inconsistent behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`, where the latter raises a KeyError while the former does not.

The potential error locations are in the handling of the `key` input parameter, specifically in the condition for `is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent branching logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers. We can modify the logic to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to achieve consistent behavior. Additionally, we need to update the branching logic to handle all types of indexers appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers and update the branching logic to handle all types of indexers appropriately. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
