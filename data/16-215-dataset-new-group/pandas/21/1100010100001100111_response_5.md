The issue in the buggy function is related to how different types of indexers are treated differently. When using a list indexer, it does not behave consistently with other types of indexers, which leads to an inconsistent behavior across various scenarios.

The bug occurs at the "if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):" condition. The subsequent code attempts to handle different types of indexers but leads to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle scalar key by using the `loc` attribute. Then, we check if the key is one of the specified types (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), and based on the inferred type, we decide whether to use positional indexer (self.iloc) or label-based indexer (self.loc) for integer keys. For other types of keys, we directly use `self.loc` to handle the indexing.

This approach ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
