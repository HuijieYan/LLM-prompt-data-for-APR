The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the way the key type is determined. It is expected to be a string, but the current implementation may not be correctly identifying the key type.

A potential bug location is in the following code block:
```python
if isinstance(key, list):
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
In this block, the key type is not being checked before handling the indexing, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can add a check for the key type and handle it accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for the key type and handled the string type differently by calling `self.loc[key]` when key_type is 'string'. Other types are handled based on their respective logic. This fix should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.

Please note that this is a speculative fix based on the provided code and test cases. It may require further testing and validation.
