## Analyze the buggy function:
The function is designed to handle different types of indexing for a series in pandas. It checks the type of the key and then performs different operations based on its type.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. In the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition, there is a missing case for the boolean type.
2. The logic for deciding whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`) based on key type seems to be flawed.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug is causing the function to incorrectly decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing a series in pandas.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to handle the boolean type.
2. Review the logic for deciding between positional and label-based indexing and ensure it is correctly implemented.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif np.isscalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # Non-integer types
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported index type: {type(key)}")
```

In the corrected version, I have added a condition to handle the scalar case separately and restructured the logic for handling different index types. I have also added a generic exception for unsupported index types.
