The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` in the file pandas/core/series.py. The function attempts to handle different types of input keys for indexing a pandas Series. However, it fails to correctly identify the type of key in certain cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py illustrates a scenario where the key is not found in the index, resulting in a KeyError.

The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are the conditional blocks that check for the type of the `key` variable and the subsequent logic that handles each type of key.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly identify the type of key, leading to incorrect handling and a KeyError being raised. This can be seen from the runtime input/output variable values, where the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, when it should be determined based on the actual type of key provided.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to improve the logic for identifying the type of the key, including handling different types of keys such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, etc., and ensuring that the appropriate operations are performed based on the type of key.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        # handle the case of list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the case of Index key
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # handle the case of slice key
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # handle other types of keys
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # handle other cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle different types of keys such as list-like, Index, slice, and other types appropriately, ensuring that the correct operations are performed based on the type of key provided.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
