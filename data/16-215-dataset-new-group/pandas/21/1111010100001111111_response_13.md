## Suggestions for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc.) in the `_get_with` function. The issue on GitHub also suggests inconsistency in the behavior of different indexers, especially when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug:
1. The code should handle different types of indexers consistently, especially when using a list indexer.
2. The code should align with the behavior described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the above concerns and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Reindex the Series
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the code handles list-like indexers by checking if the key is list-like and then reindexing the Series based on the key. This approach ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and aligns with the expected input/output values.
