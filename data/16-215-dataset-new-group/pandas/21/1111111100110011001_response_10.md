The buggy function `_get_with` is throwing a `TypeError` when the input `key` is a Series. The function is attempting to handle various types of input (`slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, `list`, etc.) but does not handle the case when `key` is a Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not have a condition to handle the case when `key` is a Series, which leads to a `TypeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to handle the case when `key` is a Series and perform the appropriate operation for this input type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):  # Handle the case when key is a Series
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, a new condition is added to handle the case when `key` is an instance of `pd.Series`. When this condition is met, the function calls `self.reindex(key)`, which should resolve the issue when `key` is a Series.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function can handle the input correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
