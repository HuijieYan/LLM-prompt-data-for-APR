The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional block that checks the type of the `key` parameter. For each case, the inferred `key_type` is always 'string', which does not reflect the actual type of the `key` parameter passed to the function.

To fix this bug, we should modify the conditional block that checks the type of the `key` parameter and properly determine its type to perform the correct operation based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame, Series, or Index is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the cases where `key` is an instance of DataFrame, Series, or Index, to raise a TypeError. We also properly determine the `key_type` and perform the appropriate operation based on its type.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
