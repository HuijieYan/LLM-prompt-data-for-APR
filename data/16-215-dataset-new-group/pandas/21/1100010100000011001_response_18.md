The bug in the `get_with` function seems to be in the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. The current implementation does not handle certain cases correctly and may not return the expected `key_type`. 

One potential error location is the logic for determining the `key_type` using the `lib.infer_dtype` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. This can lead to incorrect behavior when determining whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key` and handle all possible types of `key` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is an Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type if hasattr(key, "inferred_type") else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional checks to handle cases where `key` is an instance of `Index` and properly assigned the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. We have also used `getattr` to check for the existence of the `inferred_type` attribute in case of an `Index` type. Additionally, we have also included the check for `Series` type in the condition for handling multiple types of objects.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided cases.
