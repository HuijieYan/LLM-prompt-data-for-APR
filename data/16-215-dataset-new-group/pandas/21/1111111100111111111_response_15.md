Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue is in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. The failing test cases indicate that using a list as an indexer is resulting in a KeyError, while using other array-like indexers does not.

To fix this bug, the behavior for list indexers should be made consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers. This will ensure that the behavior is aligned and that using a list as an indexer will not result in a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the behavior for using a list as an indexer will be consistent with using other array-like indexers, and it should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub thread. This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
