The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers in Series. The issue on GitHub highlights that using a list indexer raises an error, while using other types of indexers does not.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of using a list indexer properly, leading to inconsistent behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to standardize the behavior for all types of indexers, ensuring that using a list indexer does not raise an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle other types of indexers
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a specific case for list indexers is added to ensure that this type of indexer is handled correctly, preventing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
