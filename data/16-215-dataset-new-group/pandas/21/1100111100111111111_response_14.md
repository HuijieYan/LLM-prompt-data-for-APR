The issue appears to be related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and pd.Index, when used with the `Series` object. The specific error message indicates a KeyError when using a list key.

The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of key types and the subsequent decision-making based on the key type. It appears that there is a discrepancy in how different types of key indexers are being processed, leading to the KeyError issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of key indexers, such as list, array-like, and pd.Index, within the `_get_with` function. We may also need to review the decision-making process based on the key type to handle all cases appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug and satisfy the failing tests:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle different types of key indexers
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Make consistent decision-making based on key type
        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of key indexers, such as list, array-like, and pd.Index, and makes appropriate decision-making based on the key type. This should resolve the KeyError issue and satisfy the failing tests.

Note: This fix assumes that the `lib.infer_dtype` function correctly determines the type of the key. If there are issues with the type inference, additional checks or adjustments may be necessary.
