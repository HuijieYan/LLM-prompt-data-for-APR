The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, leading to errors when attempting to retrieve values from the Series.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The if-else ladder to handle different types of `key`.
2. The variable `key_type` and its use in conditional statements.

The cause of the bug is that the function is unable to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle it appropriately. This leads to incorrect handling of different types of keys, resulting in key errors.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. We can use the `is_<datatype>` functions provided in the import statements to check the type of the key and then perform the necessary operations based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `is_<datatype>` functions to check the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and performs the necessary operations based on its type.
