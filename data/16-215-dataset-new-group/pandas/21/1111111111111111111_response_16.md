The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The failing tests indicate that using a list indexer results in a KeyError, while using other indexers such as a NumPy array or a Pandas Index does not.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError. We can achieve this by updating the logic in the function to handle list indexers similarly to how it handles NumPy arrays or Pandas Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional handling for list indexers to ensure they are treated consistently with other array-like indexers. This modification should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests and address the inconsistency outlined in the GitHub issue.
