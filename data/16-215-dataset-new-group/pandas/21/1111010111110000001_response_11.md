The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function's incorrect handling of the given key. This function determines what action to take based on the type of the input key, and the bug is causing it to skip over some types of keys that should be handled, leading to an incorrect index. This results in KeyError being raised when trying to access an element in the Series using the incorrect index.

To fix the bug, the conditions for handling different types of keys should be adjusted to make sure that all types of keys are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key):
            # handle the case of a single scalar as key
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            if is_list_like(key):
                key = list(key)

            if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
                return self.loc[key]

            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version uses the `is_scalar` and `ensure_index` functions to handle the key more accurately. Additionally, it also handles the case of `np.ndarray` and `Index` keys correctly, allowing support for them in the function.

With these modifications, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of keys properly, and it should pass the failing tests.
