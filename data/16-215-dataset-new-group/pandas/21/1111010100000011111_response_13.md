The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the discrepancies in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. In the provided GitHub issue, it is highlighted that when using `ser[key]` with `key` as a list, it raises a `KeyError`, whereas the same operation with `ser[pd.Index(key)]` and `ser[np.array(key)]` returns `NaN`. The issue also points out that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all 4 cases, which is inconsistent behavior.

Since the expected values and types for the buggy function's parameters and variables right before the return are not provided, it is unclear what exactly the output should be. Therefore, I will fix the bug based on the information provided in the GitHub issue, aiming to make the behavior consistent across all cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug in the `_get_with` function is to ensure consistent behavior when using list indexers and array-like indexers. We will address the inconsistency by examining the conditions for list indexers and array-like indexers, and ensure that the function returns the desired output for all relevant cases.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        try:
            result = self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            result = self.reindex(key)
        return result
```

In the corrected version of the function, I have added a try-except block to handle the case when using list indexers (`self.loc[key]`) results in a `KeyError`. In this case, we catch the exception and use `reindex` to return the result. This approach ensures consistent behavior for all relevant cases as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
