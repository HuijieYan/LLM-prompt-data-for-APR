The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the `key` variable, resulting in the wrong type being inferred. This leads to the function returning unexpected results, causing the failing test to raise a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the function to correctly handle different types of `key` input. We can start by identifying the type of the `key` variable and then apply specific logic based on its type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added additional checks to handle different types of `key`, including `pd.DataFrame` and `pd.Series`. We also correctly handle the type inference by checking if the `key` is an instance of specific data types and then taking appropriate actions based on the inferred type.

This corrected version should address the issues causing the failing tests while handling different types of `key` input.
