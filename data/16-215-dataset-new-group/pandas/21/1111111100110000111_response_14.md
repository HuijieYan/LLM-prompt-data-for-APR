The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` isn't handling certain indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent results. The failing test indicates that the function is not correctly raising a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like object, specifically when using the `ser[list(key)]` syntax.

The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of different indexers in the `_get_with` function. When using a list indexer, the function fails to correctly handle the case, leading to inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of indexers consistently and raises the appropriate exception when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and ensures consistent handling of indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        # handle other types of indexers as before
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # handle other cases as before
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle list-like indexers using `is_list_like` and raise a `KeyError` with a specific message if the key doesn't match any elements in the index. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and ensure that the function appropriately raises a `KeyError` in all cases where the key does not match any elements in the index.
