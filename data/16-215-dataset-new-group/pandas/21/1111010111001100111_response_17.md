## Strategy for fixing the bug
The issue seems to be related to the behavior of different indexers, specifically when using a list indexer. The failing test indicates that there is inconsistent behavior across different indexers, and it suggests that all cases should behave like the list case. The bug is likely causing the wrong behavior for list indexers.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic of the `_get_with` function, particularly the part that handles different types of indexers. We need to ensure that the behavior for all types of indexers is consistent, following the expected behavior indicated in the failing test. This may involve adjusting conditional statements and the flow of logic within the function.

Additionally, we should consider the descriptions provided in the GitHub issue to understand the expected behavior and make sure that the fixed function aligns with the proposed changes.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have restructured the conditional statements and removed redundant checks to ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers. By making sure that the logic aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, we can address the bug and ensure that the fixed function passes the failing test and resolves the issue.
