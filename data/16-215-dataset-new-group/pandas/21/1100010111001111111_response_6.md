The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases. 

Based on the provided failing test and the expected input/output values, a potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers. This would involve modifying the conditional checks and the corresponding logic for list indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the conditional check for list-like indexers and including the logic to handle them consistently with array-like indexers, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
