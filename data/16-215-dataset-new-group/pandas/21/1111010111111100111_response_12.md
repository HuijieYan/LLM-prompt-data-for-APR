The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` contains no matches, specifically when `key` is a list. The GitHub issue indicates that this behavior differs from how array-like indexers are treated, and it suggests that the behavior of list indexers should be made consistent with array-like indexers.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer contains no matches, the function fails to handle it properly and raises a `KeyError` instead of returning a consistent result as with other indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers with no matches consistently with other indexers, such as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle the case of scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, ValueError):
            return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except (KeyError, ValueError):
                return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except (KeyError, ValueError):
                return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, ValueError):
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, we added `try-except` blocks to handle cases where key contains no matches, and we consistently return a value or reindex based on whether the indexer should be positional or label-based. This ensures that the behavior of list indexers with no matches is consistent with other indexers. The `KeyError` is caught and the function falls back to reindexing in those cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
