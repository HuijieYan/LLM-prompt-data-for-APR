The issue appears to be related to the inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers in the `ser` object. Specifically, the behavior for `ser[list(key)]` is different from `ser[key]` and `ser[pd.Index(key)]`.

The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to incorrectly handling the key type, especially when it is a list. This may be causing the inconsistent behavior and the `KeyError` when using a list as the key for indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of indexers, making sure that the behavior is consistent for list, array-like, and other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to handle list-like keys separately, setting them as a list to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This should prevent the `KeyError` and resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
