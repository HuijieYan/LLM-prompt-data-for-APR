## The cause of the bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the key properly when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function doesn't account for these cases and directly calls `reindex(key)`. This causes the KeyError to be raised when indexing with these types.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the list, ndarray, Index, and Series types properly. It should check for these types and handle them accordingly before calling the `reindex` function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
```

By adding the condition `if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series))`, we can ensure that the list, ndarray, Index, and Series types are handled properly and call `reindex(key)` accordingly.
