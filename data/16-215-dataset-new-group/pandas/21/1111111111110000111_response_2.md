## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different kinds of indexers like slices, dataframes, and tuples, but the bug seems to be occurring when dealing with list-like indexers.

## Identification of Potential Errors
1. The bug may be related to how the function handles list-like indexers, as indicated in the GitHub issue.
2. The error message in the failing test suggests that the problem occurs when checking if the key is list-like using `is_list_like(key)`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug lies in the inconsistent behavior of the function when handling list-like indexers. The error message from the failing test clearly indicates that `ser[key]` raises an error for list-like indexers.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. The behavior for list-like indexers needs to be modified to match the behavior for other types of indexers.

## Bug-fixed Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the bug-fixed version, when `key` is not list-like or is any of the specified types such as `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`, the function will call the `reindex` method. Otherwise, it will default to `self.loc[key]`, ensuring consistent behavior for list-like indexers.
