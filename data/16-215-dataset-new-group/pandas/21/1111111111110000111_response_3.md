## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition for when `key` is not list-like may be causing unexpected behavior.
2. There may be an issue with how different types of indexers are being handled.

## Cause of the bug
The bug appears to be related to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The failing test case uses a list-like indexer, which triggers a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not exhibit this behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the conditions for handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior.
2. If a list-like indexer is used, handle it in the same manner as the other indexer types to address the KeyError issue.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all index types
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        pass

    # Fallback to positional indexer
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```
