Based on the error messages and the failing tests, it appears that the issue stems from the handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and pd.Index) in the `ser[key]` operation. The error message indicates that for a list indexer, the code is unable to identify any of the specified keys in the index.

This issue is consistent with the GitHub issue's description, where it points out the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to array-like and pd.Index indexers. The GitHub issue also suggests that making all cases behave like the list case could resolve this inconsistency.

To fix the bug, the `__getitem__` method needs to be modified to handle list indexers in the same manner as other indexers. This can be achieved by updating the `_get_with` method to properly handle the list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Changed the order to handle list indexers before other types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the indexer is a list, and if so, it converts it to a list. Then, it proceeds to handle the list indexers in the same manner as other indexers, addressing the inconsistency discussed in the GitHub issue.
