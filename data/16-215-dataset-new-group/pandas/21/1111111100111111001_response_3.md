The buggy function is not correctly handling the different types of key input, leading to a KeyError in the failing test cases. The key parameter can be of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series, and the function should handle each type appropriately.

The issue lies in the conditional blocks where the key type is checked. The function does not cover all the possible types of key input, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the different types of key input. It should check the type of the key and handle each type separately to ensure that the indexing operation is performed correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to an Index
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `key` input is converted to an Index using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent handling regardless of the input type. Then, the `key_type` is inferred and used to determine the indexing behavior.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
