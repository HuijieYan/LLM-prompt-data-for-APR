The buggy function seems to be causing an issue with handling list indexers differently from array-like indexers. It is failing the test cases when using a list indexer, while other array-like indexers are not failing.

The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function fails to handle the list indexer properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the index with a list key. This inconsistency in handling list versus other array-like indexers causes the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the list indexer in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")

```

This updated function will handle list indexers and other array-like indexers in the same way, preventing the KeyError from occurring and ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
