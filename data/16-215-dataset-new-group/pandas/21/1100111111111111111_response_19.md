The bug in the `_get_with` function involves incorrect handling of list-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior based on the type of indexer provided. This issue is indicated by the failing test cases, which are inconsistent with the expected behavior based on the different types of indexers used.

Based on the failing test case and the provided explanation, the function `_get_with` should correctly handle list-like indexers to avoid raising a KeyError when the index with no matches is provided.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by handling the list-like indexer similarly to other indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the list-like indexer is explicitly converted to an Index using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent handling with other array-like indexers.

This should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like indexers with the `ser[key]` operation and ensure that the failing test cases pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue logged in GitHub.
