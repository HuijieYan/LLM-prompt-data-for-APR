The bug in the function `_get_with` is that when the `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, the function incorrectly assumes the `key` as an integer, leading to the wrong code path. That's why the failing test is raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or non-scalar value before proceeding with further operations. If it's any of those types, we should handle the indexing differently. 

Based on the provided information and the failing test, below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is non-scalar or a list-like, then use loc directly
    if not is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes an additional check to handle non-scalar values or list-like keys differently by using `loc` directly. This should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
