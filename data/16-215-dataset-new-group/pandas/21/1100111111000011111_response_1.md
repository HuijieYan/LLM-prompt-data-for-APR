The bug in the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is related to the handling of different types of indexers. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` reflects the issue that arises when a list indexer is used, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers correctly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access non-matching items. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers violates the expected behavior and leads to unexpected errors.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in a consistent manner similar to other indexers to avoid the KeyError issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the list-like key in a similar way to other types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior and to avoid the KeyError issue described in the failing test case.

This corrected version addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and aims to resolve the GitHub issue related to the behavior of Series indexers.
