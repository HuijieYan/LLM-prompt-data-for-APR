The potentially problematic area in the `_get_with` function is with the if statements that check for different types of `key` being used. The issue seems to be the handling of the `key` variable in the `if not is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent `if not isinstance(key, list)` blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic is overcomplicated and does not cover all cases of `key` correctly. This results in the incorrect behavior when attempting to index the Series object with certain types of keys, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling different types of keys should be simplified and cover all edge cases. Additionally, the `key` variable should be properly validated and transformed into a valid index before being used to access the Series.

Below, you'll find the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Validate and convert the key to an index
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the conditional blocks for different key types have been simplified and the key has been explicitly converted to a valid index using `ensure_index`. The use of `is_list_like` and other checks have been removed to simplify the logic and ensure that the key is properly handled before indexing the Series. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
