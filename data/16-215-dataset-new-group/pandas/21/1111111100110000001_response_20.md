The issue can be fixed by modifying the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The issue appears to arise from incorrectly handling non-unique index values when indexing the series. The buggy function does not adequately address this, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index using different types of input data.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_get_with` method to check for the type of input and handle it accordingly. It should be able to handle input types such as a slice, tuple, list, numpy array, Pandas Series, and Pandas Index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if key.isin(self.index).all():
            if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
                key = key.index
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, we have added the ensure_index function to handle input data as an index. This function ensures that the input data is treated as a valid index, and checks if all elements are present in the series index before reindexing. If any element is not present, it raises a KeyError with an appropriate message.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_get_with` method should now pass the failing tests and handle different input types correctly.
