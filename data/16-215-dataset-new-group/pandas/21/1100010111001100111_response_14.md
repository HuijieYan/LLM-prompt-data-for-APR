The buggy function `_get_with` has a flaw in handling list-like and array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior between them. The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" has identified this inconsistency and its impact on the functionality of the `Series`. The issue states that when using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`, the result is `NaN`, but when using `ser[list(key)]`, a `KeyError` is raised because "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The issue highlights that this behavior is inconsistent and questions the compelling reason for it, as it causes confusion and does not align with user expectations.

The buggy function's flaw is identified in its mishandling of list-like indexers, leading to the incorrect behavior when a match is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior aligns with user expectations and does not raise a `KeyError` when no match is found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list-like key has been modified to convert it to an array using `np.asarray`. This ensures that the behavior for list-like key is consistent with the behavior for array-like key, eliminating the inconsistency pointed out in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue highlighted in GitHub.
