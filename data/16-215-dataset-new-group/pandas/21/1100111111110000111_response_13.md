Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when using a list-like key, the function does not handle it properly and as a result, it raises a KeyError that is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

The `test_getitem_no_matches` fails when using list-like indexers, which suggests that the `_get_with` function does not handle this case correctly. The error message indicates that when using a list-like indexer, a KeyError is raised, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. Specifically, it should not raise a KeyError when using a list-like indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that no KeyError is raised and the behavior is aligned with the expectations. After replacing the `_get_with` function with the corrected version, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
