The issue seems to be occurring in the `_get_with` method. This method is used to get items from the Series based on the given key. The failing test indicates that an expected `KeyError` is not being raised when using the key to access the Series.

After analyzing the logic of the `_get_with` method, it seems that the issue might be related to the processing of the provided key. The condition checks and subsequent handling of the key might not be exhaustive, leading to unexpected behavior and the absence of the `KeyError` being raised as expected in the test cases.

I would suggest adding more specific conditions to handle different types of keys and improve the processing logic for each case. This may involve debugging and identifying the specific type of key being passed to the method and checking that it's being handled correctly.

Here's a possible fix for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this proposed fix, I added a catch-all condition at the end to use `self.loc[key]` in case the key is not recognized as a slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, or ExtensionArray.

After applying this fix, the provided test cases should pass without raising unexpected errors.
