The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. This is in line with the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" that highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditions for checking the type of the key and determining the key type using the `lib.infer_dtype` and `key.inferred_type` methods. These areas could be causing the inconsistent behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is related to the way indexers are handled differently based on their types, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect handling of the indexer key. This inconsistency contradicts the expected behavior and leads to unexpected KeyError and TypeError exceptions.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to standardize the handling of different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior across all types. This may involve modifying the conditions for checking the type of the key, as well as the logic for determining the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` and `key.inferred_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and proposed fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers is standardized, ensuring consistent behavior across all types. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
