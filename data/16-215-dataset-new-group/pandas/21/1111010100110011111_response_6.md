The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing an inconsistency in how certain indexers are treated, leading to different behaviors and error messages for list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access non-matching values. This is inconsistent with the behavior of array-like indexers and leads to unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, and the error message should be aligned with the expected behavior for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all indexers, including list-like indexers, are handled consistently and produce expected behavior.

This fix addresses the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated and aligns the function's behavior with the expected output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
