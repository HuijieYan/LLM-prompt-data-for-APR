## Bug Location and Cause
The bug is located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The bug occurs when the function is passed a key that is not found in the index. It is expected to raise a KeyError with a specific error message, but it fails to do so.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the key type and the inability to identify that the key is not found in the index. This causes the function to return an incorrect value instead of raising an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the key type and correctly handles the case when the key is not found in the index. By updating the logic for handling different key types and adding a check for the existence of the key in the index, we can prevent the function from returning an incorrect value.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported")
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```
