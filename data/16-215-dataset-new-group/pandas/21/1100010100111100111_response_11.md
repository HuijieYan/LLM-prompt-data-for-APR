Looking at the buggy function, it appears that the issue lies in the handling of list indexers, which is different from the array-like indexers. This is consistent with the information provided in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition for handling list indexers.
2. The handling of the key_type variable.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, which leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for list indexers and array-like indexers in the _get_with function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
    if is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that both list indexers and array-like indexers are handled consistently to avoid the KeyError issue. We also use the ensure_index function to handle keys that are not list-like.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the function to pass the failing test.
