The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter and the determination of `key_type`. It appears that the function incorrectly infers the type of the `key` parameter, which leads to incorrect handling and a KeyError being raised when trying to access the Series using the key.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles it appropriately. Specifically, we should address the conditions and checks related to the `key` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, we have made adjustments to the type checks and handling of the `key` parameter to ensure that it is correctly identified and processed based on its type. This should resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
