The bug appears to be related to the different scenarios within the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class that leads to an incorrect behavior when handling key input. The failing test indicates that the key input is not being handled correctly by the `_get_with` function, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised when the incorrect behavior is observed. 

1. The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function include the conditional blocks for handling different types of `key` input, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalar values, as well as the conversion of `key` into a list and determining the `key_type`.
2. Given the failing test and the error message, it seems that the `_get_with` function is not correctly handling the key input when it is of type `Index`, `list`, or `scalar` values.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional blocks for handling different types of `key` input within the `_get_with` function are not handling the input key correctly, leading to an incorrect indexing operation, thus resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to access the `Series` with the specific `key` values.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would be to revise the conditional blocks and the logic for handling different types of `key` input within the `_get_with` function to ensure that the indexing operation is performed correctly based on the type of the input key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key is None:
        return self

    if key.equals(self.index):
        return self

    if is_bool(key):
        all_false = key.all()
        any_true = key.any()

        if not all_false and not any_true:
            raise KeyError("Passing list-likes to .loc or [] with any missing "
                           "labels is no longer supported, see "
                           "https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#deprecate-loc-reindex-listlike")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version of `_get_with`, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the `key` input is converted to a pandas `Index` if it isn't already. Then, we perform the necessary checks and indexing operations based on the type and properties of the `key` input. This revised version should address the bug and allow the `_get_with` function to handle different types of `key` input correctly, addressing the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
