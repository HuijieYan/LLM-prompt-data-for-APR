To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to identify the potential error locations and explain the cause of the bug. Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, the bug occurs due to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

The key_type variable in the buggy function is incorrectly calculated, leading to incorrect branching and handling of the key. The bug is causing different types of indexers to produce different outcomes when used to index a Series, resulting in inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function, using a unified approach to determine the type of indexer and its subsequent processing.

Additionally, the bug aligns with the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches," which highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCSeries)):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently, preventing the previous inconsistencies observed with different types of indexers.
