The issue arises due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers on a Series, particularly with a list indexer. The bug causes an error to be raised when using a list indexer, as opposed to other types of indexers, resulting in an inconsistent behavior.

The key issue in the buggy function is the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when the key is a list. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all types of indexers in a consistent way
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently and appropriately, resolving the inconsistency addressed in the GitHub issue.
