The bug in the `_get_with` function is in the conditional block for handling `list`-like keys. The function does not correctly handle the `list(key)` conditional and the subsequent reindexing.

The bug occurs because the `is_list_like` function does not correctly identify the `key` as a list-like object, leading to an incorrect conditional block being executed. The failing test case tries to access an element in the Series using a list-like key, and rather than raising a `KeyError`, it fails to raise the error, hence indicating that there is an inconsistency in handling list indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional block to correctly identify the `key` as a list-like object and handle it accordingly. We can replace the faulty block with proper checks for list-like objects and handle the reindexing appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should handle list-like keys appropriately and raise a `KeyError` when necessary, passing the failing test and resolving the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
