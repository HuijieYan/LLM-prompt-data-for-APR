The bug is caused by the function's mishandling of the 'key_type' variable, which is supposed to identify the type of the input key. In each case, the key_type is incorrectly identified as a string, which causes the conditional statements further down the function to evaluate incorrectly. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly identify the type of the input key using the runtime values and types available within the function. The function should also handle the different types of keys and indexers appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of various key types and indexers, as well as correctly identifying the key type, ensuring the function works as intended for different input scenarios.
