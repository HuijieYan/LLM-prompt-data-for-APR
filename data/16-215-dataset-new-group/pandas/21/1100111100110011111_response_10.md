The bug is related to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistency in behavior. This inconsistency is reflected in failing tests, which expect the same behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series but receive different outcomes. The failing tests indicate that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected in the case of list indexers.

The bug is likely within the conditional block handling list-like keys, where it fails to properly handle list indexers, causing the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for list indexers by updating the conditional block that handles list-like keys to properly handle list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # New block to handle list indexers specifically
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle the dup indexing case
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific block to handle list indexers, we can ensure consistent behavior for list-like keys, addressing the bug and making the function pass the failing test cases.
