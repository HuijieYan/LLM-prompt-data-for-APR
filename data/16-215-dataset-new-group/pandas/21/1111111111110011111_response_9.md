The buggy function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which is causing inconsistent behavior. It should handle all indexers consistently and in accordance with the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

It appears that the bug is caused by the way the function handles list indexers, which is different from how it handles other array-like indexers. This inconsistency causes the function to fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should handle all indexers consistently, treating them in the same manner and addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        return self[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles all indexers consistently, addressing the bug in the reported GitHub issue. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
