The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely causing the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers in the `Series` class. The GitHub issue points out that using a list indexer (`ser[list(key)]`) raises a `KeyError`, while using other types of indexers does not.

There are several potential error locations in the function `_get_with` that could be causing the issue:
1. The handling of `is_list_like(key)` may not be correct, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with list indexers.
2. The conditional statements for handling different types of indexers (`if isinstance(key, slice)`, `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`, `elif isinstance(key, tuple)`, etc.) may not be capturing all the necessary cases or may be handling them incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we can:
1. Revise the conditional statements to handle different types of indexers more accurately.
2. Ensure that the handling of a list indexer is consistent with the handling of other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for a list indexer and ensured that it is treated consistently when compared to other types of indexers. We also use the `ensure_index` function to handle the case of list indexers. This approach should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
