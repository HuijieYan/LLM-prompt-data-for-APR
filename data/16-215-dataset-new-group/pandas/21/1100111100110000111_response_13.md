The issue here seems to be related to how the `ser` Series object is indexed using different types of keys. When using a list key, it raises a KeyError, while using other types of keys and indexing methods does not.

The `ser[key]` operation seems to be inconsistent with other indexing methods and raises a KeyError in the case of a list key.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other indexing methods.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys first
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Convert other types of keys to lists for consistent handling
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    # If it's not list-like, we reindex using the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version first checks if the key is list-like. If it is, it converts it to a list and uses the `loc` accessor to retrieve the values. If it's not list-like, it proceeds with reindexing using the key.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like keys consistently with other indexing methods, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread. This corrected version should also pass the failing test cases provided.
