The bug in the _get_with function of the Series class results in KeyError when using list indexers. This inconsistency in behavior has been reported in a GitHub issue, "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue specifically mentions that treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers is causing inconsistency and that the behavior of all indexers should be aligned.

The bug is likely due to the code not handling list indexers properly, which results in a KeyError when using list key as an indexer.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle list indexers correctly and align the behavior for all types of indexers. This will involve updating the logic for list indexers to prevent KeyError from being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list indexers correctly and aligning the behavior for all types of indexers, this corrected version of the _get_with function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
