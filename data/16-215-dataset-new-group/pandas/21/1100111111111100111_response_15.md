The problem in the buggy function lies in the conditional statement:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
In this conditional statement, the code checks if the key is not an instance of any of the specified types and then converts it to a list. However, this approach is incorrect because it converts the key to a list even when it's a valid type for indexing.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement incorrectly handles the key as a non-list-like object when it is actually a list-like object. This results in an incorrect type conversion, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index with the converted key.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement to only convert the key to a list if it's not a valid type for indexing. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the key is a list, but its elements are not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"Some of [{key}] are not in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the key is a list and if any of its elements are not in the index. If so, we raise a KeyError correctly. We also updated the condition for converting the key to a list to ensure it only happens when necessary.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle different types of keys and resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing tests.
