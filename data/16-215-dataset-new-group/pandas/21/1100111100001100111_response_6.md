The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers and how they are treated differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional logic that checks the type of the `key` input and how it is being handled. Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the function's return, it seems that the `key_type` is always considered as a string, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic and how different types of indexers are handled within the function to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Update the key_type based on the type of key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = None
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type in ["mixed-integer", "floating", "boolean", "mixed-integer-float"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic for determining the `key_type` has been updated to accurately reflect the type of the key, and the handling of different types of indexers has been revised for consistent behavior. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the bug that was raised in the GitHub issue.
