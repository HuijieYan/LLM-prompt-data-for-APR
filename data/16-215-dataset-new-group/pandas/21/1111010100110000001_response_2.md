The error in the `_get_with` method might be related to an incorrect type check. It seems that the `key` might be a list or a Series, and the method is performing an incorrect operation on this input. The error message also suggests that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]", pointing to a possible issue with how the index is being used in the method.

The strategy to fix the bug would involve correcting the type checks and also ensuring that the index is handled correctly when dealing with the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if np.isscalar(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes involve simpler type checks and a more straightforward handling of different types of keys. This should address the issue and make the method work as expected.
