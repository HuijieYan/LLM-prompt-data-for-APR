The bug within the `_get_with` function is causing it to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The error message from the failing test function indicates that the function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers and is not consistent when handling different types of indexers. This is causing an inconsistency in the behavior of the function when operating on different types of indexers. The failing tests indicate that `ser[list(key)]` is causing a KeyError while other indexers do not.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to treat list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This change will ensure the consistent behavior of the function irrespective of the type of indexers provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the function in this way, it now treats all types of indexers uniformly and will not raise a KeyError for list indexers.

After making this change, the corrected version of the function should be able to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
