The buggy function `_get_with` is failing because it is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in different behavior when accessing the Series using these indexers. This inconsistency results in a KeyError being raised when using a list indexer, which contradicts the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Fixed _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if (isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) 
            or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) 
            or isinstance(key, Series) 
            or isinstance(key, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected implementation of the `_get_with` function, the problem of inconsistent behavior when using list indexers should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.

The corrected implementation ensures that list indexers are treated in the same way as array-like indexers, avoiding the KeyError that was raised previously. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
