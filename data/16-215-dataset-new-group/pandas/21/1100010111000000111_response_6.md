## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` appears to have multiple conditional checks for the input `key` and different return statements based on the type of `key`. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different data types for `key`, such as list, numpy array, pandas Index, and Series. The failing test is catching a KeyError when passing a list as `key`, which is not the expected behavior.

## Error Locations
1. The conditional check for `isinstance(key, list)` appears to be incorrectly handling a list input as `key`.
2. The function seems to be treating different types of `key` differently, which is not consistent with the behavior for different data types.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug lies in the inconsistent behavior of the function for different input types. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where the behavior for list indexers is different from array-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError for list input type.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring consistent behavior for different input types, especially for list indexers, and handling them appropriately to avoid the KeyError that's occurring in the failing test.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure that key is an Index (list-like) to avoid KeyError
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure that key is an Index (array-like) to avoid KeyError
    if key.inferred_type == "integer" and self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that `key` is converted to an Index using the `ensure_index` function, which ensures that both list-like and array-like input types are treated consistently to avoid the KeyError. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
