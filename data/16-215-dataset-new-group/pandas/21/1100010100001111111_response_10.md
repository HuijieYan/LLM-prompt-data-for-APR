The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it does not handle the case when the `key` is a list-like object properly. This causes an inconsistency in the behavior of how the Series is indexed, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location is identified as the block of code starting with `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` as it does not handle the case for a list-like object correctly.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the case when the `key` parameter is a list-like object. This leads to inconsistent behavior when indexing the Series, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list-like objects correctly. This can be achieved by explicitly checking if the `key` is a list-like object and then applying the appropriate indexing method based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        # handle the case of list-like objects
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks if the `key` is list-like using the `is_list_like` function and then proceeds to use `loc` for indexing in that case, which should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when indexing the Series.

By making this change, the function should now handle list-like objects correctly and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
