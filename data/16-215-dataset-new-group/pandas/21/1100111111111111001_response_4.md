The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the 'key' parameter. It appears that there are issues with the type checking and the conditional flow control based on the 'key' type.

Based on the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the function is not handling the 'key' parameter correctly, causing an incorrect type inference for the 'key_type' variable.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the different types of 'key' parameters and ensure that the correct type is inferred before further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the function taking into account the failing test cases and expected values:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function first properly infers the type of the 'key' parameter using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. Then, it includes the appropriate conditional checks based on the inferred 'key_type' to handle the 'key' parameter correctly and return the expected results.

By correcting the conditional checks and type inference, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
