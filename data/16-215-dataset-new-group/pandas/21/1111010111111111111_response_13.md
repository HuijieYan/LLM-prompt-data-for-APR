To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that all indexers should behave in the same way as list indexers.

Based on the input/output values and the failing test cases, it seems that the key is being transformed into different types and causing the inconsistent behavior. We should modify the function to treat all indexers in a consistent manner.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        # Handle slice, DataFrame, and tuple indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Convert key to a list and use loc for consistency
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we check if the key is a slice, DataFrame, or tuple, in which case we directly use `self.loc[key]`. If the key is of any other type, we convert it to an index using `ensure_index` and then use `self.loc[key]` for consistency.

This modification ensures that all types of indexers are treated in a consistent manner, resolving the inconsistency issue that was reported on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
