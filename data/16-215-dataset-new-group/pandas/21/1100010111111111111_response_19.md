The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior and KeyError when using a list as an indexer. 

Based on the failing tests and the provided runtime and expected input/output values, the cause of the bug is that when a list indexer is used, the function returns an incorrect `key_type` and incorrectly raises a KeyError. This inconsistency in behavior for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers is identified as the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, the function should treat list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior and handle them properly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (Series, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now handle both list indexers and other array-like indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same for all types of array-like indexers. This will address the issue raised on GitHub and fix the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers.
