To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to make the list case behave like the other cases and ensure consistency across different types of indexers.

The issue comes from the different handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The list case raises a KeyError, while the other cases do not. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for list indexers to match the behavior of other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent handling and prevent the KeyError from being raised for the list case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Changed to handle all cases
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):  # Removed list type check
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and no longer raise a KeyError for the list case. This will resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
