Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to how different indexers are being treated inconsistently in the `Series` class. The failing test expects the behavior for list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` to be the same, but it is currently inconsistent.

The cause of the bug is likely due to different treatment of indexers inside the `_get_with` function, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent error messages when using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the treatment of different indexers in the `_get_with` function needs to be standardized, ensuring consistent behavior and error messages across different indexer types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]

```

The corrected version standardizes the treatment of different indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and error messages across different indexer types, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing tests pass.
