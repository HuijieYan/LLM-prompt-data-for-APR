To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function and ensure that the behavior is consistent for different types of indexers. Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the behavior of different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        # handle scalar keys
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert iterable key to a list
    key = ensure_index(key)

    # Get the key_type
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected function, we have made the following changes:
1. Added handling for scalar keys using the `is_scalar` function and `loc` accessor.
2. Converted the iterable key to a list using the `ensure_index` function.
3. Identified the `key_type` using the `infer_dtype` function and handled cases based on the type of key.

This modified function ensures a consistent behavior for different types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
