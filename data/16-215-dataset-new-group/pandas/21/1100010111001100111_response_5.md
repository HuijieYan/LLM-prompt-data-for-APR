To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, it is important to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The bug causes the buggy function to raise a KeyError for list indexers, even though it should behave consistently with the other types of indexers.

Considering the information from the failing tests, runtime input/output variable values, and the GitHub issue, the following steps can be taken to fix the bug:

1. Identify the specific condition that causes the function to raise a KeyError for list indexers.
2. Implement a strategy to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.
3. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a way that aligns with the expected behavior for array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series values"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, list indexers will be handled consistently with other types of indexers, preventing the KeyErrors from occurring. This fix addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
