The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate values from the series, with the ultimate goal of returning the indexed values.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of `is_list_like` and `is_scalar` may not correctly identify all list-like and scalar objects.
2. The check for `key_type == "integer"` may not work as intended.
3. There is inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled, such as `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index`.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function does not handle different types of keys consistently and may incorrectly identify the type of the key, leading to incorrect indexing of the series.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use more robust methods to check the type of the keys, such as checking for specific types or using `np.isscalar` for scalar objects.
2. Have consistent handling of different types of keys to ensure the correct type-based indexing.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if np.isscalar(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have:
1. Used `np.isscalar(key)` to correctly identify scalar objects.
2. Handled string or bytes keys separately by converting them to a list.
3. Ensured consistent handling of different key types for indexing.
