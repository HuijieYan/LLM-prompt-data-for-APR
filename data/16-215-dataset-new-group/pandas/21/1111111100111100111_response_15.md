The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the conditional statements not handling the input key correctly. 

- When the key is a list, the function should use `self.loc[key]`.
- When the key is an index or an array-like object, the function should reindex the key.

The bug is evident from the failing tests that indicate the inconsistent handling of different types of key input.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling different types of keys should be revised to ensure consistent behavior for all input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function handles all types of input key consistently and should resolve the issue in the failing tests.
