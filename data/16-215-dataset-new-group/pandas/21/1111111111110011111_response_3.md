The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and the failure of certain test cases. The bug leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer in a Series, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and avoiding the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that both list indexers and other array-like indexers are handled in the same way, avoiding the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError.

With this modification, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and maintain the expected input/output values. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the inconsistent handling of list indexers.

This fix should be proposed in a pull request to the pandas repository, with appropriate tests to demonstrate the consistent behavior of the `_get_with` function with different indexers.
