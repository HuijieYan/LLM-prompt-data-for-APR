The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the test failures. The bug is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Series, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to the expected results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like indexers properly, which leads to inconsistent behavior and raises a `KeyError` for certain cases. The function also treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list-like indexers consistently with array-like indexers and ensure that the expected behavior for indexers of different types is maintained. This includes identifying the indexer type and using the appropriate method to access values from the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index if not already an Index

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes a check to ensure that the key is converted to an Index type and handles list-like and array-like indexers consistently. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the test failures reported in the GitHub issue.
