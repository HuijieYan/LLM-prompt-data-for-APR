To fix the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue lies within the logic used for handling different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and indexes. The bug causes inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles list-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError when accessing the Series with a list index that contains no matching values. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other types of indexers, such as arrays and indexes.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling list-like indexers needs to be adjusted to align with the behavior of other indexers. Additionally, the bug causes an inconsistency between the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` and `ser[key]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_integer(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function:

- The logic for handling list-like indexers has been adjusted to ensure that the indexer is converted to an index. This aligns the behavior with other indexers such as arrays and indexes.
- Additional checks have been added for boolean and integer indexers to handle them appropriately.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub by ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
