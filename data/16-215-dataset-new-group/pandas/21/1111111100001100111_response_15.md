The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. When the key is a list, the function incorrectly tries to access the value using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError because it is not matching any value in the index.

The bug can be fixed by updating the logic for handling the case where the key is a list-like object. Instead of using `self.loc[key]`, the function should return `self.reindex(key)`. This will reindex the Series using the provided key, which is the desired behavior for list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
