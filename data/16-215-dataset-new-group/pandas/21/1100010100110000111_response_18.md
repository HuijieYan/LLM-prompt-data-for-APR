The bug in the _get_with function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

The bug is related to the behavior of the function when receiving a list-like key for indexing the Series. When a list-like key is used, the function raises a KeyError, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of indexers, including list-like ones.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise TypeError("Invalid indexer type")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version of the function, we have added additional checks to handle different types of indexers, including scalars and list-like indexers. We also ensure that the function raises a TypeError when an invalid indexer type is provided.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and behave consistently for all types of indexers, as required.
