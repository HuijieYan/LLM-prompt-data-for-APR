The buggy function is the `_get_with` function in the pandas.core.series.py file. The issue described on GitHub is about the inconsistency when indexing a Series with a list having no matches.

The potential error location within the buggy function is at the conditions for different types of key input, especially the handling of a list key and reindexing.

The cause of the bug is that when a list key is used to index a Series and no matches are found, it should not throw a KeyError. Instead, it should return NaN for each position. The existing function is not handling this case properly.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function should be modified to handle a list key properly, so that NaN is returned for each position without throwing a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:  # handle the case with no matches
            return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(self))
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the length of the key list. If it's empty (meaning there are no matches), we return a Series with NaN values for each position. Otherwise, we continue with the regular indexing logic.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and the function will handle a list key with no matches properly.
