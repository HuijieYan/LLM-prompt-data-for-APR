The error message is failing because the code contains some bugs in the `_get_with` method. The problem seems to be occurring when a DataFrame, Index, or Series object is passed as an index key to the Series and it is attempting to access the value for that key.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are when the key is checked for being an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, `list`, `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index`. The logic for handling these different types of keys may need to be revised to get around the issue.

One potential cause of the bug could be in the elif statements, specifically the one checking if the key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`. In its current state, it raises a TypeError with a message about indexing a Series with a DataFrame not being supported. This likely is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we can restructure the logic to include isinstance checks for `ABCDataFrame`, `Index`, and `Series` keys, and handle each case appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index, Series)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_iterator(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

This version of the function checks for the type of the key and handles each case appropriately. It uses the `_get_values_tuple` method to extract the values from the different types of keys and raises a TypeError if the key type is not supported.
