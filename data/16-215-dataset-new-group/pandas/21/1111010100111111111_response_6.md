The bug in the function _get_with is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers. The function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistencies in behavior. This is reflected in the failing test cases, where the function raises a KeyError for a list key, but not for other array-like keys.

To fix this bug, we should ensure consistent behavior for all array-like indexers, including lists. This will align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the function _get_with that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function _get_with will now handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistencies in behavior and aligning with the expected behavior and the issue reported on GitHub.
