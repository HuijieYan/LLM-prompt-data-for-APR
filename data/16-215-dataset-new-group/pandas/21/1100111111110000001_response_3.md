The buggy function `_get_with` is throwing an error in the case of `ser[key]` calls. The error messages suggest that the key 'C' is not found in the series' index, resulting in a `KeyError`. 

The issue is likely with how the key is processed in the `_get_with` function. It appears that the function is unable to handle the key properly and is failing to fetch the value associated with it.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_get_with` function to properly retrieve the value based on the nature of the key. We can directly fetch the values from the series using the key, taking the type of key (integer, boolean, or list-like) into account.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle list-like key 
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle boolean and integer key types
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

This updated version of the function will correctly retrieve the values from the series based on the nature of the key defined. The function now handles list-like keys using `self.loc` and boolean/integer keys using `self.iloc` accordingly. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
