The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the pandas Series. The `ser[list(key)]` case is inconsistent with the behavior of the other cases, and it causes a KeyError when attempting to access values. The GitHub issue suggests that there is no compelling reason for this inconsistency and proposes aligning the behavior of all cases with the list case.

Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in how the function handles the list indexer. To fix the bug, we should align the behavior of all cases, making them consistent with the list case, as proposed in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to ensure that the key is converted to an index, and we remove the check for array-like indexers. This aligns the behavior of all cases, making them consistent with the list case, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError issue when using a list indexer.
