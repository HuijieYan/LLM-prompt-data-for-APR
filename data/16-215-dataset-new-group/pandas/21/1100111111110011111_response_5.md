The issue here is that the `_get_with` function is not handling list indexers properly and is leading to a `KeyError` when this type of indexer is used. This inconsistency has been reported as a GitHub issue, and the expected behavior is to handle all indexers, including list indexers, in a consistent manner.

It seems that the bug is related to the handling of list-like indexers in the function. The function is not properly handling list indexers, which is leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test. The function should be updated to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled similarly to other indexers in the `_get_with` function. We can achieve this by updating the conditional statements to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in a consistent manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This should also ensure that the failing test case is now passed without raising a `KeyError`.
