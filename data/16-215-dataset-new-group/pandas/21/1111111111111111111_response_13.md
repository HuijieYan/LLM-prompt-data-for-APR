The bug appears to be in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The issue seems to stem from different behaviors for list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The failing test cases indicate inconsistencies in how these different indexers are handled, resulting in a KeyError for the list indexer case.

The root cause of the bug might be related to the handling of different indexers and how they are validated within the `_get_with` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self[key]
```

In this corrected version, we handle the different types of indexers consistently by using `self.loc[key]` for array-like indexers and `self[key]` for other types of indexers.

This fix should address the inconsistency and ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently across different types of indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
