To fix the bug, it seems that the function is not handling the case properly when the key is a list. The KeyError is raised when the key is a list, because it is not being handled correctly. 

We can update the function to handle the case when the key is a list and use the `self.loc[key]` strategy in that case, which should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # For List-like keys
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle list-like `key` parameters without raising a KeyError, and the failing test should pass.
