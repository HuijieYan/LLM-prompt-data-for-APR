## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and arrays. The bug may occur due to incorrect handling of the different indexer types and inconsistencies in behavior when handling them.

The expected input and output values for the function have not been provided, but we can see that the `_get_with` function is expected to handle various types of indexers and return the result based on the type of indexer.

The buggy function makes use of the `key_type` variable to determine the type of indexer and then performs different actions based on that type.

The GitHub issue suggests that there is inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behaviors and errors.

## Bug Identification
The bug may be related to the inconsistent handling of list indexers versus array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError when a list indexer is used.

The function checks for the type of indexer using `key_type` and then uses various conditional statements to determine the action to be taken based on the type. However, it seems that the handling of list indexers is not consistent with the handling of other types of indexers, leading to the identified issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, including list indexers and array-like indexers. We should review the conditional statements that check the type of indexer and ensure that the actions taken are consistent for all types.

The fix may involve refactoring the conditional statements and the way different types of indexers are handled within the function to ensure that list indexers are treated similarly to array-like indexers.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Replaced the condition for not list-like indexers to utilize loc directly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Utilize loc with list or array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        # Utilize loc with Index type
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Utilize reindex for other indexers
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the function now consistently uses `loc` for both list and array-like indexers, ensuring that the handling of indexers is consistent across different types. This should resolve the inconsistency and the issue reported on GitHub.
