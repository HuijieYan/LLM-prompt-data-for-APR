The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that when the key is a list, it is not handled correctly, leading to the KeyError exception. The issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file is meant to check the inconsistency in the behavior of the `_get_with` function when using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the list indexer case appropriately to ensure consistent behavior with other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray, Series)) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the list indexer case appropriately and pass the failing test. It ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub about the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
