The buggy function `_get_with` is improperly handling the case of passing a list index to a Series. The function does not handle the case of a list index properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other index types.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the list-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior when compared to other index types. This inconsistency is pointed out in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of a list index is different from other index types, causing failures when using `ser[list(key)]`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all index types. The fix involves handling the list index case correctly, similar to the other index types, so that the function behaves consistently for all indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle list-like indexers consistently with other index types, ensuring that the behavior is the same for all indexers. This will address the inconsistency in behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
