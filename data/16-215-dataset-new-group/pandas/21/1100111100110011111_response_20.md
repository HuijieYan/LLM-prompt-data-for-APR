The bug in the _get_with function of the Series class is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, such as list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The function is not handling these different types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected KeyErrors for some cases.

The primary cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the different types of indexers in a uniform manner. It's treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which is causing the inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency is leading to KeyErrors when using certain types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _get_with function to handle all types of indexers consistently. It should behave the same way for list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series indexers. This will ensure that there is no unexpected behavior and that KeyErrors are not raised in some cases.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensuring that the key is a valid index
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we are ensuring that the key is a valid index using the `ensure_index` function. This will handle all types of indexers consistently and prevent unexpected KeyErrors from being raised.

This fix will ensure that the _get_with function behaves uniformly for all types of indexers, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
