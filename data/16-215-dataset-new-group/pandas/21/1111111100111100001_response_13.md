The bug occurs because the function is not handling the keys correctly for indexing the Series object. The function checks if the input key is a scalar or a list-like object, then tries to infer the type of the key. However, the logic for handling the key's type is not correctly implemented, leading to errors in indexing the Series object.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately determine the type of the key and handle it appropriately. This can be done by using the correct conditionals and type checking to identify the key's type and apply the corresponding indexing method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper type checking and handling for different types of keys, ensuring the proper indexing behavior for the Series object.
