The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be causing issues with the indexing of the Series. The failing tests are raising a `KeyError`, which indicates that the function is not handling the indexing correctly.

The function seems to be checking the type of the `key` parameter and branching to different logic based on its type. However, in many cases, it seems to incorrectly determine the type of the `key`.

To fix the bug, we could modify the type-checking logic and make sure that the type of the `key` is correctly identified and handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Multi-item lookup
        return self.loc[key]

    # Key is neither a scalar nor a list-like
    raise ValueError("Invalid key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

This corrected function includes handling for various types of `key` inputs and ensures that the indexing is performed correctly.

The function now checks if the `key` is a scalar, and if so, uses `self.loc[key]` for the lookup. If it's not a scalar, it checks for list-like types and performs the lookup accordingly.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior for different types of input keys.
