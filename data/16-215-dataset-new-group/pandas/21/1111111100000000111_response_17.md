The buggy function `_get_with` is causing inconsistency when treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which is the subject of the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue is related to the behavior of different indexers and the inconsistency in handling list indexers.

The bug is caused by the code's conditional logic, which behaves differently for list indexers and array-like indexers. The main issue is the inconsistency in handling list indexers, which can lead to the "KeyError" exception when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for both list indexers and array-like indexers. This will involve handling the list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Treat the indexer as a positional indexer
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle the case where the key is not list-like by converting it to a list. Then, we determine the key type and decide whether to treat the indexer as positional or label-based, ensuring consistent behavior for both list indexers and array-like indexers.

This modification will resolve the inconsistency in handling list indexers and align the behavior with the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
