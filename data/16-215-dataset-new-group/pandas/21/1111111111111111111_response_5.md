The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent treatment of different indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions when using a list indexer. The behavior differs from using array-like indexers such as arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When applying a list indexer, it currently fails to handle the case appropriately, leading to a KeyError exception when it should not occur.

To fix the bug, we need to implement consistent handling of all types of indexers in the `_get_with` function to ensure that list-like indexers are processed in the same manner as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like and handle accordingly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list to ensure consistent handling
    key = list(key)

    # Use loc for all types of indexers, including lists
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will treat all indexers equally, providing consistent behavior and resolving the KeyError exceptions encountered when using list-like indexers.

This fix will address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves as expected across different types of indexers.
