The bug in the _get_with() function seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled, particularly list indexers. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling list indexers correctly and is raising a KeyError when it shouldn't.

It seems that the bug may be in the section of the code that handles list-like indexers. It is likely not recognizing list indexers properly and therefore is not able to locate the values in the index.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle list indexers the same way it handles other indexers, such as array-like indexers. This may involve updating the conditional statements and the logic for handling different types of indexers.

Here is a corrected version of the _get_with() function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    # handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle other types of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above modified function, list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, and the KeyError issue when using list indexers should be resolved.

This fix should address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers.
