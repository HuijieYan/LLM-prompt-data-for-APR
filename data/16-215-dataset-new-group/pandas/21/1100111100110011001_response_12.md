The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the key types and the indexing process. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly raising a KeyError in some cases. 

Based on the error messages and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug might be related to the determination of the key type and how it is processed in the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly determined and that the indexing process is handled appropriately for different key types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled through conditional statements to determine the appropriate indexing method. This should address the issues with the failing tests and ensure that the function returns the expected output for different input types.
