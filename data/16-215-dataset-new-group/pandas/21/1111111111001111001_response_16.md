The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to occur when processing the `key`. The key is expected to be a string, but the function is incorrectly identifying its type as "integer". This causes the function to access the wrong index, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles it appropriately. We can use the `dtype` attribute of the key to determine the type, and then proceed with the corresponding action based on the type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check the type of the key
    key_type = key.dtype

    if key_type == 'object':
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now correctly identify the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
