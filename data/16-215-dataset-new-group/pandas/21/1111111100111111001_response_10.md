The bug in the `_get_with` function causes it to raise a `KeyError` when it's expected to handle the input `key` correctly, resulting in failing test cases.

The bug is directly related to the incorrect determination of the key type. The function incorrectly identifies the key type for some input types, leading to an erroneous selection of handling method for the key.

I suggest correcting the bug by ensuring that the key type is correctly identified and handled by the function, based on the input type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that the key type is correctly identified, and the corresponding handling method is applied. It eliminates the possibility of a `KeyError` and aligns with the expected behavior for different input types.
