Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that there is a difference in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue mentioned that using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` all return the same results, while `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError.

The bug in the `_get_with` function could be causing this inconsistent behavior. Specifically, the code block `if isinstance(key, list): return self.loc[key]` is problematic, as it only handles the case when the key is a list, but not when it's a single item in a list.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the key is a single item in a list, as well as the case when it's a list. We can use the `is_list_like` function to check if the key is list-like, and then use the `self.loc` method to get the values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle single item case
    
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list case for key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now properly handles both single item keys in a list and list keys, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
