## Analysis:
The issue is related to the behavior of the `ser[key]` indexing operation for different types of indexers, specifically for list-like indexers. The error message suggests that the behavior for the list indexer case is inconsistent compared to other array-like indexers.

## Potential error locations:
- The condition block for handling list-like indexers stands out as a potential location for the bug.
- The logic within the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ...))` check might be incorrect, leading to the inconsistent behavior.
- The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" directly points to the code responsible for raising this KeyError.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers when using the `ser[key]` indexing operation. For list-like indexers, it raises a KeyError with a specific message, while for other array-like indexers, it doesn't.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers when using `ser[key]`. This might involve reviewing the condition blocks and the logic associated with different types of indexers.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the logic for handling list-like indexers has been revised to ensure consistent behavior. It now handles list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
