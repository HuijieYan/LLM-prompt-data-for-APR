Based on the code provided, the bug seems to be in the `_get_with` function, particularly in the logic for handling different types of keys and returning the corresponding values. The bug could potentially be in the following areas:

1. The `if` condition for handling a slice of keys may not be working as expected.
2. The logic for handling different types of keys and determining the appropriate method for retrieving values might not cover all edge cases.

To fix the bug, we need to address the issues mentioned above and ensure that the logic for handling different types of keys is accurate and covers all possible scenarios.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (bool, np.bool_)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I've added a condition to handle boolean-type keys, and also revamped the handling of scalar and list-like keys. Additionally, the `key_type` determination and the decision between label-based and positional indexing have been removed because they don't seem to be necessary.

These modifications should address the potential issues and improve the overall logic of the function.
