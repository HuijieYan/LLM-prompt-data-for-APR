The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` seems to be causing an inconsistency issue when used with list indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` emphasizes this issue, as it raises a `KeyError` for the list indexer.

The cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This is also pointed out in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

To fix the bug, we can update the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not (is_scalar(key) and not (is_list_like(key))):
        # The above condition will check for non-list like and non-array like scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a condition to differentiate between non-list like and non-array like scalars, ensuring that they are handled consistently.

The corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes without raising a `KeyError`.
