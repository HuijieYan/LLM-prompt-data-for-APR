The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other indexers. The GitHub issue points out that there is inconsistency in the behavior of `ser[key]` when key is a list, `pd.Index(key)`, `np.array(key)`, and `list(key)`. The bug causes `ser[list(key)]` to raise a `KeyError` when none of the elements in the list are found in the index, while `ser[key]` and the others do not raise the error in the same scenario.

The strategy to fix this bug would be to ensure consistent behavior across all different types of indexers and handle the case of `ser[list(key)]` to align with the behavior of other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return NotImplemented

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    indexer = ensure_index(key)
    if isinstance(indexer, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or is_categorical_dtype(indexer):
        return self.loc[indexer]

    if not is_integer(indexer):
        indexer = list(indexer)
    return self.reindex(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, I have introduced a check for scalar values and utilized the `is_categorical_dtype` and `ensure_index` functions to handle different types of indexers consistently. Additionally, the `list` key scenario is explicitly handled to align with the behavior of other indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and provide consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
