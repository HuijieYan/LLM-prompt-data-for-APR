The bug in the given function seems to be related to the type checking and handling of the 'key' parameter. The function seems to be incorrectly handling different types of inputs. It also appears that the function may not be returning the correct types and values for the variables in some cases.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of different types of 'key' inputs and the incorrect determination of 'key_type'. The function should handle the 'key' parameter properly and determine its type correctly in order to perform the appropriate operation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the different types of 'key' inputs and determine the 'key_type' based on the input. Also, the function should be refactored to ensure that it returns the expected types and values for the variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks for scalar types and refactors the conditional statements to address the issues with determining the 'key_type' and handling different types of 'key' inputs.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
