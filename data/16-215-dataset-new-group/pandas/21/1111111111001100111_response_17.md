The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list indexers correctly and raising a KeyError instead of returning NaN for cases where the list index does not match any values in the Series. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Upon analyzing the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it is evident that the key_type is being incorrectly inferred as 'string' in each case, leading to the issue.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers. It should return NaN when the list index does not match any values in the Series, instead of raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    values = self.loc[key]
    result = self.reindex(key)
    result[values.index] = values
    return result
```

In the corrected version, a new `result` Series is created using `self.reindex(key)`, and then the values are updated based on the matching index entries from the original Series. This ensures that NaN values are returned for list indexers that do not match any values in the Series, consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
