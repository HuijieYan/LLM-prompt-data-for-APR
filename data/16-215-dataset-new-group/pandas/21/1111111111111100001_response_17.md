The bug in this function occurs when the `key_type` variable is determined to be `'string'` in all provided cases. This results in the function always trying to take the `reindex` path, which is not appropriate for the given inputs and leads to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the `key` input in the `_get_with` function and choose the appropriate method based on that. We can do this by using the `is_list_like()` function to check if the `key` is list-like, and if so, return the result of `self.loc[key]`. Otherwise, we should use `reindex` as the default method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
