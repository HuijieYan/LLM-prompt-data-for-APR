The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the condition where the type of `key` is checked. It seems that the logic for handling the type of `key` is incorrect, leading to the wrong branch of the conditional statements being executed.

From the failing test, we can see that the function does not handle the case where the key type is `'string'` correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`. The expected behavior in this case should be to return the `key` as a sliced Series without raising an error.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the conditional logic for handling the different types of `key`. Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # New code to handle the different types of 'key'
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the different types of `key` and return the appropriate result without raising a `KeyError` based on the failing test cases.
