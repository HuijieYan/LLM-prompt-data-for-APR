The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the inconsistent treatment of indexers, specifically list indexers, in the `Series` class. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when using a list indexer, while it behaves differently for other array-like indexers. This is related to the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" where the inconsistency in behavior is highlighted.

To fix the bug, we should make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers, so that the function handles list indexers in the same way it handles other array-like indexers. This should resolve the `KeyError` being raised when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, eliminating the inconsistency in behavior. This should resolve the `KeyError` being raised when using a list indexer, and it should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
