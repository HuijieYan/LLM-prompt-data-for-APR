The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This can be deduced from the failing test where using a list indexer results in a `KeyError`, while other array-like indexers do not.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that all indexers, including lists, are processed consistently and do not result in a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = self.index[key]  # Convert all indexers to Index to ensure consistent treatment
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we convert all indexers to an `Index` using `self.index[key]` before calling `reindex`. This ensures that all indexers, including lists, are processed consistently and do not result in a `KeyError`. This fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
