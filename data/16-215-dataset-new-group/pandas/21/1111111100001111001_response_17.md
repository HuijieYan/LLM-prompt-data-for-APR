The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable not being correctly inferred. The code is checking for specific types of the `key`, but it seems that the type inference is not working properly in all cases, leading to the `key_type` being incorrectly set to `'string'`.

To fix this issue, it might be necessary to revisit the type inference logic and ensure that it correctly identifies the type of the `key`. Additionally, it could be beneficial to add more specific type checks to handle the different types of `key` in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a more comprehensive check for scalar values, as well as a restructured workflow for handling different types of `key`. Additionally, the `key_type` is being inferred using the `infer_dtype` function, which should help in correctly identifying the type of the `key`.
