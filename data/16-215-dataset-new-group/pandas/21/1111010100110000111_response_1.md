Here's a potential explanation of the bug and how to fix it:

- The bug is likely related to how different indexer types are handled in the `_get_with` function of the Series class. The test fails when using a list indexer, while other indexers (e.g., np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) work as intended.
- The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent index.
- To fix the bug, it seems that the `_get_with` function needs to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other indexers, such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle list-like indexers in the same way as other indexers, thereby resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's description of inconsistencies in how different indexer types are handled.
