### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle indexing of a Series object, but it fails to handle the case where a list is used as an indexer. This issue is discussed in the GitHub issue where it is pointed out that treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers leads to inconsistent behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that using a list as an indexer causes the `_get_with` function to raise a `KeyError` with the message `"None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"`.

### Error location
The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the handling of list indexers.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the case where a list is used as an indexer. This leads to inconsistent behavior compared to how other indexers are treated. The failing test demonstrates that using a list as an indexer results in a `KeyError`.

### Bug-fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Bug-fix implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    # Original code is retained for other indexers
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # Remaining conditions follow...
```

In the fixed version of the code, the `if isinstance(key, list)` condition is added to specifically handle list indexers and return the result of `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistent behavior for list indexers and resolves the inconsistent handling of indexers pointed out in the GitHub issue.
