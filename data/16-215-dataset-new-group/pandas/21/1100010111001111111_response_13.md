Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, specifically when handling a list indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of other indexers and leads to a KeyError in certain cases.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers. The handling of list indexers should be adjusted to avoid the KeyError that currently occurs.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the handling of list indexers is made consistent with other indexers, aiming to resolve the inconsistent behavior and prevent the KeyError that occurs in certain cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers.
