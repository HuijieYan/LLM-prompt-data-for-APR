The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue states that using list indexers results in a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not exhibit this behavior.

The root cause of the bug can be identified in the conditional statements within the `_get_with` function. Based on the provided runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the handling of list indexers is different from other types of indexers, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the handling of list indexers is aligned with the handling of other types of indexers, leading to consistent behavior across different indexer types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key] if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() else self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been aligned with the handling of other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior for different indexer types. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test cases pass as expected.
