The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access a non-existent key in the series. The bug seems to be related to the determination of the `key_type` and the subsequent handling of the key based on its type. The function appears to incorrectly infer the `key_type`, which leads to the wrong handling of the key.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to correctly infer the `key_type` based on the type of the key being passed. Additionally, the logic for handling the key based on its type should be adjusted to ensure that it is processed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
