The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` file has an issue with the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. It is treating them differently, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditions and operations for different types of key input, as well as the handling of the `key_type` variable.

The cause of the bug is based on the inconsistent treatment of list indexers versus array-like indexers within the function. This inconsistency leads to different KeyError messages and behavior based on the type of the key input.

To fix the bug, a strategy involves standardizing the behavior for all types of indexers (list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series) to match the one observed with the list case. This will require updating the conditionals and operations within the `_get_with` function. Additionally, the handling of the `key_type` variable should be reviewed and possibly revised to ensure consistent behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Standardize behavior for list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With the corrections made, the `_get_with` function now treats all types of indexers consistently, aligning their behavior with the initially observed list case, and resolving the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
