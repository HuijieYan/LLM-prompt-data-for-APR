To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case when the key is a list. It should behave consistently with other array-like indexers by returning NaN for values not found in the index. We also need to ensure that the correct error message is raised when none of the list elements are found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is not found in the index, the function will catch the KeyError and use `reindex` to preserve the index and return NaN for missing values.

With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for list-like indexers.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the bug related to inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers.
