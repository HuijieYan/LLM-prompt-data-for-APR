## The bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the inputs `key` and `self.index` are of different types and the handling for these cases is not properly defined.

## The fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle different types of `key` inputs and align them with the underlying index type. We can achieve this by explicitly making conversions and checking the types properly.

## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with non-matching types is not allowed, use appropriate data types"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we perform explicit type checks and conversions for the `key` input in various cases, ensuring that it aligns with the underlying index type and handling each case properly to prevent the bug from occurring.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing tests should be passed without raising any errors.
