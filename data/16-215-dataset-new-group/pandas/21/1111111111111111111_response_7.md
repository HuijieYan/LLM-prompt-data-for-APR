## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The failing test tries to index a Series using a list-like indexer, resulting in a `KeyError` with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This inconsistency is observed compared to the behavior of indexing with other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects.

The function `_get_with` contains logic to handle different types of indexers, but it fails to handle list-like indexers correctly.

## Bug Location
The potential error location is the block of code that handles list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly. This results in inconsistent behavior and the generation of a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like object. The function should handle list-like indexers in a manner consistent with the handling of other types of indexers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. It should determine the type of the indexer and handle it appropriately based on whether it is a list, an array, an Index object, or any other type of indexer.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes handling list-like indexers consistently, ensuring that they are treated in a manner similar to other types of indexers. With this correction, the function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and return the expected results, resolving the issue observed in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issue.
