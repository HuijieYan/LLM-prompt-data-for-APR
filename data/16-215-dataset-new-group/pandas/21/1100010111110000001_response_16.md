Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the problem is in the `_get_with` function, particularly in the block of code where it deals with the `key` input. It should return the KeyError, but the function is not raising the exception as expected.

Looking at the `_get_with` function, the potential error is in the following block of code:

```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```

Here, if `key` is not list-like, it attempts to use it as a location-based indexer. However, in the failing test, `key` is an instance of `pandas.Series`, which is not being handled properly in this function. This could be causing the function to not raise the expected KeyError.

The fix for this bug would be to handle the `pandas.Series` type specifically in the function and ensure that appropriate exceptions are raised when an invalid `key` is used.

The corrected version of the function after fixing the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("Invalid key type")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now handles pandas Series objects correctly and will raise an appropriate KeyError if an invalid `key` type is provided. This change should make the corrected version of the function pass the failing test.
