The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles the `key` parameter. The function is supposed to handle various types of input for the `key` parameter and perform different actions based on the type of the input. However, the function seems to incorrectly identify the type of the `key` parameter in some cases, leading to errors.

The failing test is testing the behavior when attempting to access an element that does not exist in the `Series` object. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables inside the function for the failing tests, it appears that the `key_type` is being incorrectly set to `'string'` instead of `'object'`. This may be leading to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revisiting the logic for identifying the type of the `key` parameter and ensuring that it is correctly identified in all cases. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the key does not exist in the Series and raise a `KeyError` as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the logic for identifying the type of the `key` parameter has been revised, and additional conditions have been added to handle different types of keys appropriately. The function now also correctly handles the case where the key does not exist and raises a `KeyError` as expected.
