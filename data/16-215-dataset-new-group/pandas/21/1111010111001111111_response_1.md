The issue is with the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not properly handling list indexers, leading to inconsistencies and failures in certain test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not treating list indexers the same way it treats other array-like indexers. This leads to inconsistencies and test failures, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version handles all array-like indexers (including lists) uniformly, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
