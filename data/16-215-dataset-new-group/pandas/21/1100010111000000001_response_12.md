The buggy function appears to be the `_get_with` method from the `pandas/core/series.py` source file. This function seems to handle the different ways of getting items from a pandas Series object.

In the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`, a Series `ser` is created containing the elements "A" and "B". Then, a key `key` containing the element "C" is created and converted into different box types such as list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series. The test then attempts to access `ser[key]` and checks that a KeyError is raised with a specific error message.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function could be the handling of the key when not list-like. It's possible that the `return self.loc[key]` statement may not be handling certain key types correctly.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When the function encounters a non-list-like key, it should return the result of `self.loc[key]`. However, if this handling is incorrect, it may lead to a KeyError being raised in certain cases, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the correct handling for non-list-like keys is in place. This may involve modifying the logic to correctly handle the key type and access the corresponding elements from the Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        # handle non-list-like and scalar keys
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The correction includes a more robust handling of non-list-like and scalar keys by adding a condition to handle scalar keys immediately and return the corresponding values from the Series using `self.loc[key]`.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle non-list-like keys correctly and pass the failing test.
