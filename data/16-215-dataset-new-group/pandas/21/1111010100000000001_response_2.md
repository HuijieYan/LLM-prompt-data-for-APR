The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of index keys and return the corresponding values from the series. However, there are several potential error locations within the function.

Firstly, the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` will never be executed because `ABCDataFrame` is intended to be an abstract base class, and the condition `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` will not be satisfied for any object.

Secondly, the condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` attempts to access an attribute `inferred_type` which is not a property of the `Index` class. This will result in an AttributeError.

Finally, the condition `if key_type == "integer":` is used to decide whether to treat the key as a positional or label-based indexer, but it does not handle the case where the key is a boolean indexer.

To correct the issues identified, a strategy for fixing the bug involves fixing the conditions handling the different key types and determining how they should be indexed.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key = key._values
        return self.reindex(key, copy=False)
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Cannot use '{type(key).__name__}' as indexer")
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for handling the key types have been revised to correctly handle different types of index keys, including boolean, integer, and others. Additionally, the conditions that were not being executed have been removed, and the handling of `Index` objects has been updated to access the underlying values using `_values`.
