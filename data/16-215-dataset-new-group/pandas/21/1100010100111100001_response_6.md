The issue with the provided function is that it fails to handle all the possible types of input `key`. It only checks for a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, and a few other types, but it does not handle all valid types of input keys.

The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly handling some input types, leading to a `KeyError`. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, which suggests that it is not correctly detecting the type of input key.

To fix this bug, we can improve the handling of different input types and ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key before trying to process it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (bool, int, np.bool_, np.integer, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added checks for boolean, integer, numpy types, and more comprehensive checks for a list. We also explicitly handle DataFrame and Series inputs to provide more informative error messages.

These changes should address the issues seen in the failing tests and provide a more robust handling of different input types.
