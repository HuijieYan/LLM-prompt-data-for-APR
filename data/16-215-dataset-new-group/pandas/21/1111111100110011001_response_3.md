The bug in the provided function is likely to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter and the resulting `key_type` variable. The function seems to be expecting the `key_type` to be a string, but it is not properly defined and inferred from the `key`.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect inference of the `key_type` variable. This is probably leading to incorrect indexing behavior, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised during the test execution.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of the `key` parameter.

Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is properly inferred based on the type of the `key` parameter, and the appropriate indexing behavior is applied according to the inferred type. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected with the given test cases.
