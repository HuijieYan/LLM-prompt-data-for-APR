The bug appears to be related to the handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The tests are failing when using a list indexer to access a `Series` object. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, and suggests that the behavior should be made consistent, possibly by making all cases behave like the list case.

The bug seems to be related to the way list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers. In the failing test, when using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` indicating that none of the values in the list are in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with the other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the handling of list indexers to match the behavior of other indexers. This could involve ensuring that the list indexer behavior aligns with the behavior of other types of indexers, specifically when accessing elements from the index of the `Series` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now checks if the key type is either "integer" or "string" and returns the result using `self.loc[key]`. This aligns the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers, ensuring consistency and fixing the bug.

With this correction, the tests should now pass and the behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
