The issue seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically lists. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, the function raises a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not have the same issue. This inconsistency is causing confusion and unexpected behavior for users.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, the function is not handling it correctly and raising a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the handling of list-like indexers needs to be adjusted to match the behavior of other indexers and avoid raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Added handling for list-like indexers to match behavior of other indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer" and not self.index.is_boolean():
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added handling for list-like indexers to make sure they are treated consistently with other indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and prevent the KeyError from being raised when using a list-like indexer.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
