To fix the bug, we need to address the different behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue on GitHub provides context for the expected behavior and the inconsistency in the error raised when using list indexers.

Looking at the failing tests, we can see that the bug is related to the treatment of different types of indexers, causing the inconsistency in error messages and behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError being raised for list indexers, while other types of indexers do not raise an error.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and Index, and handle the indexing accordingly inside the `_get_with` function.

Based on the analysis and the GitHub issue, here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle other kinds of indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

By adding the condition to handle list-like indexers, we ensure that all kinds of indexers are properly handled, providing consistent behavior for the `_get_with` function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior for list indexers.
