To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue is related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers. When using `ser[list(key)]` as an indexer, it raises a `KeyError` even though other array-like indexers behave differently.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify how list indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function to make them consistent with the behavior of array-like indexers. This will involve updating the conditional logic for checking the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, ABCSeries)):
        # Apply boolean indexing within the loc method
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this change, the function will now correctly handle list indexers and yield more consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
