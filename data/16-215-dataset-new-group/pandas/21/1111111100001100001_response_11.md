The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` input. Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the return, it appears that the `key_type` is not being inferred correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. 

The `key_type` is determined using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, and this may not be providing the correct type for the input `key`. This could be due to different input types being passed to the function, resulting in incorrect type inference.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the type of the `key` input is checked and inferred correctly. Additionally, it might be necessary to adjust the conditionals for handling different types of inputs to ensure that the correct execution paths are followed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added additional checks to ensure that the correct type inference is performed for the `key`, and adjusted the conditional statements to handle different types of input appropriately. This should address the underlying bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
