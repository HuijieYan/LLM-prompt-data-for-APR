Looking at the buggy function, we can see that the issue lies in determining the key_type and handling different types of keys appropriately. The function fails to handle the case when the key is a list or ndarray, which leads to a KeyError later in the test when these types of keys are used.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys are handled correctly by the function, and the appropriate indexing method (loc or iloc) is used based on the type of key.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should handle different types of keys properly, and the failing test cases should pass.
