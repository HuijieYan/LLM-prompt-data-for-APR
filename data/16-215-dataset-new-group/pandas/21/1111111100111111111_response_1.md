The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The issue arises when using a list index that does not match any values in the Series.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional statements that handle different types of indexers and the incorrect handling of list indexers. The current implementation raises a `KeyError` when using a list indexer that does not match any values in the Series, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling different types of indexers need to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_array = np.asarray(key)
    
    if key_array.dtype == object:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected implementation, the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
