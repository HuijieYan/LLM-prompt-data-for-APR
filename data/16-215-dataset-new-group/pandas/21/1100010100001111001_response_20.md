The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the determination of the data type of the key parameter. Based on the provided code, the function is intended to handle different types of keys and perform specific operations based on the type. However, in Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the variable `key_type` is always assigned the value `'string'` regardless of the input key type.

A potential cause of the bug is that the logic for determining the data type of the key is not correctly handling the different types of keys passed to the function, leading to the incorrect assignment of `key_type`.

To fix the bug, we should redesign the logic for determining the data type of the key so that it accurately reflects the type of the input key. Then, based on the determined type, we can perform the appropriate operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine the dtype of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # For other types of keys, handle them accordingly
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we remove the check for `is_list_like(key)` and instead use the `lib.infer_dtype` function to accurately determine the type of the key. We also handle the key based on its determined type, which should resolve the bug.
