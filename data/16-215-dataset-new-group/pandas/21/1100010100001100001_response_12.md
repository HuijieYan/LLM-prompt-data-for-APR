The issue with the buggy function lies in the variable `key_type` being incorrectly assigned the value `'string'`, instead of being correctly inferred based on the type of the `key` input. 

Given that the variable `key` has varying types in the different cases (list, ndarray, Index, Series), the function is not properly handling the type inference for the `key_type`. This leads to the function failing in different scenarios.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly infer the `key_type` based on the type of `key` provided. This can be achieved by explicitly checking the type of `key` and setting the `key_type` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function accurately infers the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key` and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This ensures that the function works as intended for different input scenarios.
