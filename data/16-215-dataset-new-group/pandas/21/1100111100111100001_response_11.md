The buggy function `_get_with` is failing due to a KeyError being raised when attempting to index the Series `ser` with the key `key`. The key can be of type list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.

Upon analyzing the variables and input parameters, it seems that the key is not being handled properly based on its type, leading to the KeyError.

The bug is likely occurring due to the wrong type inference for the `key` variable. The conditional logic needs to be adjusted to handle key type appropriately.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle different types of key inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # handle the case when key is not recognized, return the reindexed series
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the conditional statements are adjusted to correctly handle different types of key inputs, ensuring that the Series indexing is performed correctly and the KeyError is not raised.
