The buggy function's implementation for `_get_with` is causing issues with different types of input indexers. It is not handling list indexers properly. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, as pointed out in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

Based on the expected cases and the GitHub issue, it looks like the bug is occurring when the input key is of type `list`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle list indexers properly and ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list indexers properly
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a specific check for `list` and `np.ndarray` types to properly handle list indexers. This change ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers and should fix the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
