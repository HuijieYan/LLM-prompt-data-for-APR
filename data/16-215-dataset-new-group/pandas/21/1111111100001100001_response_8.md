The bug in the _get_with function appears to be related to the incorrect identification of the key_type, which is causing the function to return the wrong type of data. The key_type is supposed to represent the type of index, either integer or label-based, so that the correct type of indexing operation (iloc or loc) can be selected. 

Upon analyzing the runtime input/output values, it seems that the key_type is not being correctly inferred, leading to incorrect returns.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for inferring the key_type based on the type of input key. We also need to ensure that the correct indexing operation (iloc or loc) is selected based on the key_type.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Handle non-list-like scalars
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Handle list or array-like input
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we handle non-list-like scalars upfront, and then infer the key_type using the lib.infer_dtype function. Based on the inferred key_type, we select the appropriate indexing operation (iloc or loc) to return the result.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the _get_with function returns the correct result for different types of input keys.
