The potential errors in the given function include:

1. Incorrect usage of `ABCDataFrame` in the `isinstance` check, which is not a valid check for the data type.
2. The usage of `key` in multiple `isinstance` checks could lead to incorrect flow control in the function.
3. Inconsistent use of `key` as a list in certain conditions.

The cause of the bug in the function is primarily due to the incorrect usage of `isinstance` checks, which can lead to incorrect flow control and incorrect type identification of the key.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to use correct type checks and handle different types of keys appropriately without mixing them up.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if all(isinstance(k, int) for k in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError("Key type not supported")
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the type of `key` using `isinstance` for different types and handles them appropriately. It also includes additional checks to determine whether the key is positional (integers) or label-based (strings). The strategy for fixing the bug was to rewrite the logic to handle different key types more explicitly and avoid mixing them up.
