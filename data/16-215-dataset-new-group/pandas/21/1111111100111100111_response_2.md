The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list indexers correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access elements that are not in the index. This issue has been reported on GitHub in the context of treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The failing tests indicate that different input types are not being handled consistently, leading to unexpected errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are handled consistently, with proper error handling if the elements are not in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

The corrected version includes proper error handling for list indexers by handling the KeyError if the elements are not in the index.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle different types of indexers consistently and provide the expected behavior for each input type, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
