The bug in the code seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The issue arises when using list indexers to access a Series object, resulting in inconsistent behavior in comparison to other array-like indexers.

The bug occurs when the test case fails to raise the expected KeyError when using list indexers with a Series. This inconsistency in behavior is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

Based on the error messages from the failing test cases, it appears that the issue is with how list indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. When accessing a Series object with a list indexer, it fails to raise the KeyError as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in a consistent manner similar to other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that list indexers raise the KeyError when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly catch the KeyError when using list indexers and raise it with the appropriate message. This change ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

By making this modification, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
