The bug in the _get_with function is related to the different behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers in a Series. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and different error messages.

The bug is caused by the conditional check `if not is_list_like(key)` followed by index handling where the behavior differs for different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent results and error messages.

To fix this bug, we can update the function to handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same for list, array-like, and Index indexers. We also need to ensure that the correct error message is raised when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the handling of different types of indexers is consistent, and the correct error message will be raised when there are no matches in the index. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the function should behave as expected for all types of indexers.
