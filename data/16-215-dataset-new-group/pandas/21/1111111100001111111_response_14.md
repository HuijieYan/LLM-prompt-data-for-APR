To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The issue is that `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`, while `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not. The goal is to make all of these cases behave consistently.

The cause of the bug is that the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies in the behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner. Specifically, we should modify the logic to ensure that all types of indexers, including list and array-like indexers, are handled appropriately without raising errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with a slice or DataFrame is not supported")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")
```

In the corrected version, we've removed the specific checks for different types of indexers and instead handled them using a more generic approach. This should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and prevent the KeyError that was occurring in the previous implementation.

With the corrected version, the function should now handle different types of indexers (including list and array-like indexers) without raising errors, thus resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
