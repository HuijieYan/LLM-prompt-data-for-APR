## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys, such as slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple, and list-like objects. The issue seems to be related to the handling of list-like key input. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function does not raise the expected KeyError for the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is created from a list in the test case.

The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" mentions the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically between `ser[key]` and `ser[pd.Index(key)]`.

## Bug Location
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles list-like key inputs. When `key` is a list, the function is not returning the expected behavior, leading to a test failure.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, especially when `key` is a list. The function is not behaving consistently when dealing with different indexer types, leading to test failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for the `_get_with` function when handling list-like key inputs. We also need to address the inconsistency when using different indexer types to ensure the expected behavior is consistent across all cases.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # ... (other functions)

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in {"integer", "string"}:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key_type` is properly handled for list-like indexes, including both "integer" and "string" types. This should address the inconsistency in handling different indexer types and fix the bug.
