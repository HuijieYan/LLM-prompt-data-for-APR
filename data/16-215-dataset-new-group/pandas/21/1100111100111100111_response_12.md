The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the handling of list-like indexers. Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it seems that the behavior of the function when using a list as an indexer is inconsistent with other indexers such as arrays, indices, and Series.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the handling of list indexers, specifically the check for `is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent conditional blocks. It seems that the function is not handling list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle list indexers in a way that is consistent with other types of indexers. We also consider multiple types of key types, such as "integer," "string," and "mixed," to ensure that the appropriate indexing method is used based on the key type.

This corrected version should address the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers and resolve the failing tests and the issue reported in GitHub.
