The function `_get_with` is handling different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to a failed test case where the list indexer is not behaving as expected. The error message indicates that the expected KeyError is not being raised when using a list indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to an inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This discrepancy has been reported in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of list indexers is compared to other indexers and found to be inconsistent.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle the list indexer in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers. Specifically, the function needs to ensure that a KeyError is raised when using a list indexer that contains values not present in the index.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list indexer
    if isinstance(key, list):
        missing_values = [value for value in key if value not in self.index]
        if len(missing_values) > 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handling other indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the list indexer in a consistent manner and raise a KeyError if the list contains values that are not present in the index. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
