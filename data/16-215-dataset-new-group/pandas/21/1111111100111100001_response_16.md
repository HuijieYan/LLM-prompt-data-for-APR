The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles the input `key` and how it interacts with the `self.index` and `key_type` variables. The function should support various types of input such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series, but it seems to be failing for all types of input.

The key issue seems to be with the `key` variable being used to reindex the Series. The function should handle the key type appropriately, and this might not be happening correctly.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to carefully handle the different types of input that `key` can have and ensure that the reindexing operation is performed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        except AttributeError:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the function handles the input `key` based on its type and ensures that the reindexing operation is performed correctly. This should resolve the issue and make the failing tests pass.
