The issue with the `._get_with` function in the provided code is that it doesn't handle the case where the key is a list or an array-like object correctly. This results in inconsistent behavior and errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug is likely occurring due to the function not properly handling the input key when it is a list or array-like object, which leads to the KeyError. To fix this bug, it's necessary to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list or array-like keys properly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling non-list-like cases
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the key is list-like, and if it is, we directly use the `loc` method to perform the indexing. For non-list-like cases (e.g., numpy arrays, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), we use the `reindex` method.

With this correction, the function should handle the different types of keys consistently and avoid the KeyError that was reported in the failing tests.
