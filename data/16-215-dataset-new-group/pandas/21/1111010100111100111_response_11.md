To address the bug in the `_get_with` function, it's important to recognize that the function treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers. The problem arises from differing behavior when using list indexers, which results in inconsistencies between list, array-like, and Series indexers.

To fix the bug, the function should treat list indexers the same way it treats other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/series.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    """
    One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).
    
    Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object
    supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of
    methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical
    methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude
    missing data (currently represented as NaN).
    
    Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their
    associated index values-- they need not be the same length. The result
    index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, Iterable, dict, or scalar value
        Contains data stored in Series.
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.23.0
           If data is a dict, argument order is maintained for Python 3.6
           and later.
    
    index : array-like or Index (1d)
        Values must be hashable and have the same length as `data`.
        Non-unique index values are allowed. Will default to
        RangeIndex (0, 1, 2, ..., n) if not provided. If both a dict and index
        sequence are used, the index will override the keys found in the
        dict.
    dtype : str, numpy.dtype, or ExtensionDtype, optional
        Data type for the output Series. If not specified, this will be
        inferred from `data`.
        See the :ref:`user guide <basics.dtypes>` for more usages.
    name : str, optional
        The name to give to the Series.
    copy : bool, default False
        Copy input data.
    """




    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've removed the conditional checks for `key_type` and made the function return `self.loc[key]` for all array-like indexers, including lists, numpy arrays, and pandas Index objects. This ensures consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

By making this change, the function will now handle list indexers in the same way as it handles other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
