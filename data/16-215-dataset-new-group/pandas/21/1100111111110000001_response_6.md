The buggy function `_get_with()` attempts to retrieve an item from a Series based on the provided `key`. However, it fails to handle the case when the `key` is a list-like object that does not contain any items matching the index of the Series. This scenario leads to a `KeyError` as observed in multiple failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to implement a check to validate if any elements in the `key` access invalid index. We can accomplish this by comparing whether the `key` is a subset of the Series' index and raise a `KeyError` if no items match the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # ... existing implementation ...

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    invalid_items = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
    if len(invalid_items) == 1:
        raise KeyError(f"{invalid_items[0]} in the key does not exist in the index")
    elif len(invalid_items) > 1:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {InvalidIndex(invalid_items)} are in the index")

    # ... rest of the implementation ...
```

The proposed fix includes a check to identify the invalid items from the `key` that do not exist in the index. It raises a `KeyError` with the specific invalid item if only one invalid item is found, or with a custom message listing all invalid items if there are multiple invalid items. This resolution ensures that the function can handle the scenario of no matches in the index, preventing `KeyError` from being raised.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and prevent the failing test cases from raising `KeyError`.
