The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class of the pandas library is identified. The code is designed to slice a Series object using a key, and there is a specific branch of the code that handles when the `key` is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The failing tests indicate that an error occurs when handling these specific input types.

The cause of the failure is that the `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` types are not being handled correctly in the `_get_with` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle the input types that are failing the test cases (i.e., `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`) and ensure that the slicing operation works as expected for these input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        # handle list-like keys that are not numpy arrays or ExtensionArrays
        return self.reindex(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle all other index types (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index, Series)
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

The correction involves adding a separate check for `list`-like keys, which includes lists, numpy arrays, and pandas Series or Index objects.
This should resolve the issues identified in the failing tests.
