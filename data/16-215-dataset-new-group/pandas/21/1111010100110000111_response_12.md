The source of the bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas package. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior in the indexing of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue was reported in a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", where it was noted that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is that when using list indexers, the `_get_with` function is not handling the case correctly, causing it to raise a KeyError when there are no matches in the index, instead of returning NaN as it does for array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, resulting in consistent behavior when indexing a `Series`. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
