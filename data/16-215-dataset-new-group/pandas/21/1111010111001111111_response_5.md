The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled, specifically list-like indexers. The function currently raises a KeyError when using a list-like indexer, such as `ser[list(key)]`, even though other types of indexers, such as `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`, do not raise an error and return NaN instead.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of list-like indexers is consistent with other types of indexers. We can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This should resolve the KeyError issue and make the behavior consistent across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this correction, we check if the key is a scalar using `is_scalar(key)`, and if it is, we return the result of `self.loc[key]`. This ensures that scalar keys are properly handled. We also remove the unnecessary condition `if key_type == "integer"` and handle boolean indexers separately.

By making these modifications, we should be able to fix the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
