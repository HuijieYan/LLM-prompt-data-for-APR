To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers when used with the `ser[key]` operation, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The issue arises from the different error handling for list indexers compared to other indexers when they do not match any value in the Series index. To resolve this inconsistency, we'll modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    # Reindexing is the common behavior for all types of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, and the behavior will be consistent across different types of indexers.

This fix addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that all types of indexers behave consistently when used with the `ser[key]` operation.

After implementing this fix, the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue should pass, and the behavior of the `_get_with` function will align with the expected input/output values.
