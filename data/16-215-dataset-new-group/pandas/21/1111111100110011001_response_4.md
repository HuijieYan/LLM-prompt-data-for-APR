The issue in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the key is a list-like object or an instance of the `pd.Series` class, which results in a `KeyError` being raised during the test. The function should handle all possible types of keys when trying to access the series.

To fix this bug, I will modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle different types of keys. Specifically, I will handle the case where the key is a list-like object or an instance of the `pd.Series` class. Additionally, I will ensure that the inferred type of the key is properly handled and returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I have added logic to properly handle the key when it is a list-like object or an instance of the `pd.Series` class. Additionally, I have ensured that the key type is inferred using `lib.infer_dtype` and handled accordingly.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
