The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of key input, specifically when using a list as the key. This inconsistency causes a KeyError to be raised for list-based indexing, whereas it does not occur for other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects. This can be achieved by handling list key input in a similar way to other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index if not already

    if not key.is_all_dates and not key.is_all_dates:
        return self.reindex(key)

    if len(key) == 0:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key.to_series()]
```

This corrected function ensures that list-like input keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and preventing the KeyError from being raised.

By implementing this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of key input.
