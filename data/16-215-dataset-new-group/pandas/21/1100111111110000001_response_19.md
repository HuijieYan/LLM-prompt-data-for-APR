The issue comes from the `_get_with` function, where a KeyError is not being raised when it should be happening. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised when doing `ser[key]`, but it's not happening. It's likely that the condition to raise the KeyError is not being met.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition to raise a KeyError is being met. One possibility is that the condition for `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` is being met, and then the subsequent conditions are failing.

Let's fix this by properly handling these cases in the `_get_with` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated version of the function, we specifically check if the key is not list-like and is not found in the index, and if so, raise a KeyError with the appropriate message. This should ensure that the failing test passes with the corrected `_get_with` implementation.
