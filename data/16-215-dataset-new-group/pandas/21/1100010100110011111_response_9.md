To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, the following steps can be taken:

1. The error occurs when trying to index a Series with a list, numpy array, Index, or another Series. The error message indicates a KeyError, stating that none of the provided values are in the index.

2. The potential error locations are within the conditional blocks for `isinstance(key, list)`, where `self.loc[key]` is returned, and for `isinstance(key, tuple)`, where `self._get_values_tuple(key)` is used.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistent handling of indexing the Series with different types of objects like lists, numpy arrays, Index, or other Series, as indicated in the GitHub issue. It seems the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent when compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency leads to errors when accessing elements that are not present in the index.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects (lists, numpy arrays, Index, or Series). This could involve aligning the handling of different indexers to produce consistent outcomes and avoid KeyError exceptions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle the case for list, numpy array, or Index-like keys
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        # handle the case for np.ndarray and Series keys
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers has been aligned to produce consistent outcomes for indexing the Series. This should resolve the KeyError exceptions that were observed during the failing tests.
