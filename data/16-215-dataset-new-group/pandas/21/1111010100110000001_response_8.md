The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is unable to correctly handle the `key` argument provided, causing a `KeyError` when attempting to access a non-existent index. The function doesn't properly handle the case when the `key` is an empty list or a non-existent value.

To fix this bug, we'll need to update the function to handle these cases more gracefully and efficiently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Boolean indexing case
    if is_bool(key):
        if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # All other cases
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        # Handle the KeyError
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the `key` argument gracefully and efficiently. Now, when the function encounters non-existent index values, it will raise a `KeyError` with a more informative message, as indicated by the failing test messages provided previously.
