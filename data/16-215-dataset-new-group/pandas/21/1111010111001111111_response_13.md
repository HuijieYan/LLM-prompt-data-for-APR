The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. The issue is raised because `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, `ser[np.array(key)]`, and `ser[list(key)]` return the same result, but `ser[key]` raises a KeyError. The behavior is inconsistent, and the question is whether there is a compelling reason for this.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. We can modify the function to handle all indexers in the same way as the list case to avoid the inconsistency.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the function will handle all types of indexers consistently, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
