Looking at the provided buggy function, it seems to be handling different types of indexers in a way that is not consistent, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors. 

The test cases indicate that when using a list as an indexer, it causes a KeyError, while using other types of indexers like arrays, Index, or pd.Series does not raise a KeyError. This is inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers.

The issue from GitHub also points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. The inconsistency arises when using `ser[key]` for a list `key`, as it raises a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, indexes, and pd.Series.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the indexer is a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple, and handles them accordingly. Then, it checks if the indexer is not list-like and returns `self.loc[key]` in that case. 

After that, if the indexer is neither a list, nor an array, nor an ExtensionArray, nor a Series, nor an Index, it is converted to a list. Then, it checks the inferred type of the indexer, and if it is either "integer" or "boolean", it handles the indexer based on this type. Otherwise, it falls back to using `self.loc[key]`.

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
