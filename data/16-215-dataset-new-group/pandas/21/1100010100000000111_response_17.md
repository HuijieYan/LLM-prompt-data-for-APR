The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case when a list indexer is provided and there are no matches. This is identified in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue highlights that when a list indexer is used and there are no matches, it should behave consistently with other indexers such as array-like indexers.

The bug in the `_get_with` function can be fixed by implementing a check for list indexers with no matches and handling it appropriately. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle the case when list indexer has no matches
    if key_type in ["integer", "list"]:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except KeyError as e:
                # Handle the case when list indexer has no matches
                if key_type == "list":
                    return self.reindex(key)
                else:
                    raise e
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, an additional check for the key type "list" has been added to handle the case when the list indexer has no matches. This ensures that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers.
