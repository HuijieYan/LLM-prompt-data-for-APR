The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the input `key` properly in some cases, leading to a `KeyError` being raised in tests. From the error message, it seems that the bug occurs when the function is called with different types of `key` inputs, such as a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.

The function seems to be having issues with the handling of different input types for the `key` parameter and determining the `key_type` based on the input. This results in incorrect behavior when trying to retrieve values based on the provided `key`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the different types of `key` inputs and determine the correct `key_type` to ensure that the correct indexing method (e.g. `loc` or `iloc`) is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle different types of `key` inputs correctly and determine the `key_type` appropriately, ensuring that the correct indexing method is used to retrieve the values from the series for each case.
