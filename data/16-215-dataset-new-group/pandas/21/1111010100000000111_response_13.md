The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The code has some inconsistencies in how it handles indexers, specifically the behavior of how it treats list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

To fix this bug, all indexers need to be handled consistently, whether they are list indexers or array-like indexers. This will involve updating the logic for handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version addresses the inconsistency in the handling of list indexers and array-like indexers by treating all indexers in a consistent manner. This approach aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue to make all cases behave like the list case.
