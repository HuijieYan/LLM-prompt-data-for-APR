Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when trying to index a series with a list that has no matches.

The bug is specifically linked to the issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", which points out the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The issue is caused by the conditional statement `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` which incorrectly handles the case when `key` is a list. The function incorrectly converts the list to an index and raises a KeyError when there are no matches. This is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to handle the case when `key` is a list. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the `key` is list-like and handles it separately to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with a list that has no matches. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
