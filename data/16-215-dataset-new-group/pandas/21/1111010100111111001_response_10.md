The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function failing to handle the `key` parameter properly when it is of type array/list-like and not of type slice or DataFrame. It is incorrectly treating the `key` parameter as if it were a scalar, resulting in the KeyError. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a section to handle array-like objects correctly, ensuring it is processed as a list of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # for any other type of indexing, reindex the key if needed
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function handles array-like objects separately using the `is_list_like` method, ensuring the correct behavior when indexing a Series object.
