The issue comes from the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers versus array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` call. The bug seems to stem from the method `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the method does not handle the list indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to access the data using a list indexer. This results in an inconsistent behavior with array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the method properly handles list indexers, which should resolve the `KeyError` issue and bring consistency to the behavior of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we modified the condition for handling list indexers to ensure they are properly processed using `self.loc[key]`. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue and bring consistency to the behavior of different types of indexers.
