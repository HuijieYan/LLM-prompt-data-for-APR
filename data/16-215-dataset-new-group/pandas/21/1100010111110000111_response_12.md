First, it's important to note that the bug seems to be caused by the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The GitHub issue mentions inconsistencies in behavior among different types of indexers, leading to unexpected results. The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we should aim to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. Adding additional logic to handle list indexers in a way that is consistent with array-like indexers should resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list to ensure consistent behavior
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # Consistently use positional indexing
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]  # Consistently use label-based indexing
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional logic to handle list indexers in a way that ensures consistent behavior with array-like indexers. With this fix, we should be able to resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also pass the failing test.
