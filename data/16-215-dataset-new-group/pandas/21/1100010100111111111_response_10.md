The bug is occurring in the `_get_with` function due to the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of indexers. The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of a list indexer properly, leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditional checks and logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers appropriately. Additionally, the behavior should be made consistent across different types of indexers to resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and handle list indexers properly, thereby addressing the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
