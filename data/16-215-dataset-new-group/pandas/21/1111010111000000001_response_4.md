The potential error locations are within the different conditional blocks and type checks within the `_get_with` function, such as the type check for a DataFrame, tuple, and integers, as well as handling duplicates and reindexing.

The bug seems to be related to the conditional blocks responsible for checking the type of `key` passed to the function. It is failing to handle the case where the `key` is an array-like object and is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles array-like objects appropriately and returns the correct value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and is_object_dtype(self.index.dtype):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ABCSeries)) or is_dict_like(key):
        if not self.index.is_unique or not self.index.is_monotonic_increasing:
            return self.reindex(key)
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = self.index.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the `key` is an array-like or a DataFrame more appropriately and ensure that the correct values are returned based on the type of `key`. Additionally, we handle the case of non-unique or non-monotonic indexes when reindexing.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
