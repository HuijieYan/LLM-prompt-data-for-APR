The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the handling of list indexers. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" points out that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior with `ser.loc[key]` and other indexers. The issue also highlights a specific test case where the behavior is inconsistent.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior when handling list indexers. The fix should aim to align the behavior of list indexers with array-like indexers and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    # Handle list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.reindex(key)
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, a specific check and handling for list indexers have been added. If the key is a list, the function attempts to reindex using the list, and if a `KeyError` is raised, it is caught and re-raised with a meaningful message to address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue. Other cases are handled as before to ensure consistent behavior across different indexers.
