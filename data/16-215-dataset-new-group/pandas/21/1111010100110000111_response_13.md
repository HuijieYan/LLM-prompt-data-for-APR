## Analysis
The bug is happening in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class in the pandas library. The function is intended to retrieve values based on the input key type, and it currently has logic for different types of keys, including lists, slices, and tuples. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when it receives a list-like key.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in a KeyError for list indexers but not for other array-like indexers.

## Potential Error Locations
The potentially erroneous part of the code is the handling of list-like keys within the `_get_with` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function is not handling list-like indexers correctly, leading to KeyError in some cases but not others.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle all types of indexers consistently. It should ensure that list indexers behave the same way as other array-like indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Ensure that the key is a list-like type
        key = [key]

    # Convert key to a list if it is an Index or other valid type
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we ensure that the key is a list-like type and then convert it to a list if it is an Index or other valid type. This ensures consistent handling of list-like indexers and should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and the failing tests.
