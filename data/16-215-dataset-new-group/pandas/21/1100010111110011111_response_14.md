## The buggy function

The `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series. However, it fails to handle list-like indexers properly, as evidenced by the failing test cases. The root cause of the bug can be traced to the conditional statements and the handling of different types of indexers within the function.

The failing test case attempts to index a Series using a key generated from a list, numpy array, Pandas Index, and another Series. The expected behavior is consistent for the first three types of indexers, but it fails for the list index, throwing a KeyError.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how various types of indexers are handled by the Series, particularly when it comes to the behavior of indexing with a list.

## Bug Analysis

1. The function does not handle the list-like indexers (`key`) properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index a Series.
2. The conditional statements that check the type of the indexer and the subsequent treatment are not covering all possible cases.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug is to enhance the conditional logic to properly handle list-like indexers. This involves identifying the type of indexer and ensuring that the appropriate action is taken. Additionally, consistency with how different types of indexers are handled should be maintained to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of list-like indexers (`key`) has been improved. If `key` is list-like, it is converted to a list. Subsequently, the type of the key is inferred, and appropriate actions are taken based on the type. Additionally, the function ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers and aligns with the expected behavior.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
