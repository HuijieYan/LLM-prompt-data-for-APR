The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect determination of the type of the key when it is not an integer. This leads to the wrong behavior in handling the key for indexing. The function does not handle non-integer keys properly, resulting in a KeyError being raised during the test. To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the key type and handling different types of keys properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        if key.dtype == np.bool_ or (is_categorical_dtype(key) and key.categories.dtype == np.bool_):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for key: {}".format(type(key).__name__))
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle different types of keys and prevent the KeyError from occurring during the test mentioned.
