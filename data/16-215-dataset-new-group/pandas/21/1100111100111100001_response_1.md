The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or an object that is not recognized.

The key_type is incorrectly assigned the value 'string' in all cases, indicating that the function is not correctly inferring the type of the key.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key, and handles lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:  
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        raise IndexError("This function does not support boolean indexing yet")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes the following changes:
1. Correctly handles key as a list or ndarray by converting it to a list if it is not list-like.
2. Identifies the type of the key correctly by checking for instances of Index and Series.
3. Handles integer and mixed-integer key types appropriately by using loc or iloc as needed.
4. Raises an IndexError if the key type is boolean, indicating that the function does not support boolean indexing yet.
