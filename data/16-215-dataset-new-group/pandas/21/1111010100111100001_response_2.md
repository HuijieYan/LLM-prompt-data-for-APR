#### Bug Fix
The bug seems to be related to the identification of the key type. From the provided information, it appears that the key type is being incorrectly identified as a string in all the runtime cases. This incorrect identification results in the wrong selection of operations, which in turn leads to the failing tests.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the condition that identifies the key type for errors.
2. Ensure that the key type is correctly identified as either an integer or label-based type.
3. Implement control flow to use the correct operations based on the identified key type.

#### Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if type(key) == Index:
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we enforce the correct identification of the key type and implement the necessary control flow to perform the operations accordingly. This should resolve the failing tests.
