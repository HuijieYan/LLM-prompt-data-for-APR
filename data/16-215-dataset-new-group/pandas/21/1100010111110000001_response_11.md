The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function checks if calling `ser[key]` raises a KeyError with a specific error message. The parameter `box` for the test function signifies the type of the key by constructing a Series.

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for a Series. However, it's failing in the scenarios when the key is a Series or np.array, as indicated by the failing test. 

The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case when the key is an instance of `np.array` or `Series`. This is causing the test to fail, as it expects a KeyError to be raised when attempting to index into the Series with the key object.

To fix the bug, we need to add handling for `np.array` or `Series` type keys within the `_get_with` function so that it behaves correctly when these types of keys are passed. We should use `np.array` or `Series` methods to access the elements of the key in order to retrieve the corresponding data from the Series.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function that will pass the failing test is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle array or Series types
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)): 
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The added condition `if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):` handles the case when the key is an instance of numpy array or pandas Series, and it uses `loc` method to index into the Series with the key.

By making this change, the corrected function should now behave correctly when given a `np.ndarray` or `Series` key. This will allow it to pass the failing test.
