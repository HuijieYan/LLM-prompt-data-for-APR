Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list-like indexer. The GitHub issue further supports this by pointing out the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers, which results in inconsistent behavior and raises a KeyError when using a list-like indexer.

To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # Handle the case for list-like indexers
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # Reindex for other types of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle list-like indexers by checking if the key is list-like and then treating it accordingly using `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
