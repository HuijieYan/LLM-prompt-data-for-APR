The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically lists, array-like objects, and Pandas Series. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when using these different types of indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

The cause of the bug is likely in the conditional logic that handles different types of indexers. The function fails to handle the case where a list-like indexer is used, leading to the KeyError exception.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling list-like indexers needs to be adjusted to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks to handle scalar values and list-like indexers. The revised code should address the inconsistent behavior and resolve the KeyError exceptions observed in the failing tests.
