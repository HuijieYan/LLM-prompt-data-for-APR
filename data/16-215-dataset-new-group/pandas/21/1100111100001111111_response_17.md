The bug is due to inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors for different types of indexers, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list indexers (`key`) consistently, leading to unexpected behavior. The bug occurs when determining the type of the key using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, which leads to incorrect handling of the key.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that all types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) are handled consistently and produce the expected behavior. This can be achieved by directly checking the type of the key and then processing it accordingly. Additionally, the handling of the key type should be consistent with its use in the subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key_type = "list"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly checking the key type and processing it accordingly, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers. This aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
