## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Pandas Series. However, it fails to handle the case where a list indexer is used and there are no matches in the Series, causing inconsistencies in behavior compared to other types of indexers. This issue is related to the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", where the behavior of list indexers is inconsistent with other types of indexers, resulting in KeyError when there are no matches in the Series.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are within the blocks that handle different types of indexers, particularly the handling of list indexers and the check for matches in the Series.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers, leading to a discrepancy in behavior and resulting in a KeyError when there are no matches in the Series.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. Specifically, it needs to handle the case where there are no matches in the Series for list indexers to avoid the KeyError and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the function explicitly handles the case when `key` is not list-like by converting it to a list. Then, it checks for the key type and ensures proper handling for list indexers by catching the KeyError and reindexing the Series. This approach ensures consistent behavior for list indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
