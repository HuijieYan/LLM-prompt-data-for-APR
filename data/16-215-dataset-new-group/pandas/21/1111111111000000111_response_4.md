The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior in the results and error handling.

The cause of the bug is that when using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`, the result is consistent and returns NaN for index values that are not found in the series. However, when using `ser[list(key)]`, it raises a `KeyError` stating that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This inconsistency is raised as an issue on GitHub, and the example test breaks because of this behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to make the behavior of using `ser[list(key)]` consistent with the other cases, where the result should also return NaN for index values not found in the series, and not raise a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    result = self.loc[key]
    if isinstance(result, Series):
        # If the result is a Series, return it as is
        return result
    else:
        # If the result is not a Series (e.g., NaN for missing index), convert to Series
        return Series(result, index=self.index[key])
```

In the corrected version, we use `self.loc[key]` to handle all cases, including list indexers. If the result is a Series, we return it as is. If the result is not a Series (e.g., NaN for missing index), we convert it to a Series by specifying the index. This ensures consistent behavior and resolves the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
