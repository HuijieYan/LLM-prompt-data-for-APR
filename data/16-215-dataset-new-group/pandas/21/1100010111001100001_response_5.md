The bug in the function is that it incorrectly determines the type of the `key` parameter, leading to the wrong behavior in the function's execution. The function checks if the `key` is an integer, but if it fails this check, it proceeds with incorrect assumptions about the type of the `key`.

The incorrect behavior is due to the incorrect handling of types in the function when processing the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, the function should use proper type checks and handle different types of keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles different types of keys, and it should pass the failing test.
