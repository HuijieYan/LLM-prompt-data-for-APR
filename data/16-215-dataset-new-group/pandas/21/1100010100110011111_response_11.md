Based on the error message and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles indexing with a list. The function is not treating a list indexer the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and a KeyError when there are no matches in the index.

The bug is caused by the function not handling list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and errors when no matches are found in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers and that it does not raise a KeyError when no matches are found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if len(key) > 0 and isinstance(key[0], str):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers and ensure that it does not raise a KeyError when no matches are found in the index. This should resolve the issue and make the function consistent across different types of indexers.
