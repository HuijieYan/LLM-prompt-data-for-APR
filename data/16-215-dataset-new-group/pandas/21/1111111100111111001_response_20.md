```python

    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):

        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (pd.Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):

        return self.loc[key]
``` 

The bug was fixed by adjusting the logic to handle different types of input `key` and returning the appropriate result for each type. Additionally, the condition `if not isinstance(key, (pd.Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray))` was updated to include `ExtensionArray`, which was previously not included. This allows for accurate type checking on the `key` parameter.

By making these adjustments, we can ensure that the correct behavior is applied for each type of input, fixing the error and allowing the function to return the expected output.
