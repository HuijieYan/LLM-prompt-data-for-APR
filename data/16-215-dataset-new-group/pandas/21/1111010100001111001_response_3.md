The bug seems to occur when determining the type of the key used for indexing in the `self._get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly identifying certain types of keys and improperly handling them, leading to the wrong type of index being used in generating the output.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to refine the logic for determining the type of key and then use the correct method for indexing based on this type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, dict):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version revises the logic for the handling of different types of keys, using the `loc` method by default for indexing, regardless of the key type. This approach ensures that the correct method for indexing is consistently applied, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values.
