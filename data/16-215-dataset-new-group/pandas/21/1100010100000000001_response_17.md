## Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key inputs and return the appropriate value from the series. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The check for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` is incorrect and will raise a TypeError instead of handling DataFrame inputs.
2. The conversion of key to a list using `key = list(key)` is unnecessary and can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The handling of key types like Index and boolean is not accurately implemented.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rewrite the `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` check to appropriately handle DataFrame inputs.
2. Remove the unnecessary conversion of key to a list.
3. Improve the handling of key types such as Index and boolean to ensure correct behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now appropriately handles DataFrame and Series inputs, removes unnecessary conversion to a list, and improves the handling of key types like Index and boolean for more consistent behavior.
