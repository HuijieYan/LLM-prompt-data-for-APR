The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable, which should represent the type of the `key` parameter. However, the `key_type` variable is incorrectly assigned the value `'string'` regardless of the actual type of `key`, which results in an incorrect behavior when the function tries to operate based on the `key_type`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should use the correct logic to determine the type of the `key` and assign the appropriate value to the `key_type` variable. This will ensure that the subsequent conditional checks based on the `key_type` operate as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key_type` variable is assigned a value based on the actual type of `key`, ensuring that the subsequent conditional checks operate correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected results for the given input parameters.
