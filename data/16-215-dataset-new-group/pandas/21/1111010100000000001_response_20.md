The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. This method is used to retrieve values from the series based on the input `key`, which can be a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or other index-like objects.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Handling of different types of keys and determining whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing.
2. The use of `is_list_like` and `np.ndarray` for checking the type of the key may not cover all cases, leading to incorrect execution paths.
3. The logic for deciding whether to use `self.loc` or `self.iloc` for positional and label-based indexing may lead to inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of different types of keys and the decision-making process for positional and label-based indexing. Some key types may not be handled correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to:
1. Update the condition checks for different key types to handle all possible cases, including edge cases and custom index-like objects.
2. Refactor the decision-making process for positional vs. label-based indexing to ensure consistent behavior based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all types of keys
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_indexer = np.asarray(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_indexer, skipna=False)
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            return self.iloc[key_indexer]
        else:
            return self.loc[key_indexer]
    else:
        key_indexer = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key_indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the function handles scalar keys separately using `is_scalar`, applies `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the key type for `np.ndarray` and other index-like objects, and uses `ensure_index` to convert non-list-like, non-ndarray keys to an index. The decision between `self.iloc` and `self.loc` is based on the inferred key type, ensuring a consistent behavior for different types of keys.
