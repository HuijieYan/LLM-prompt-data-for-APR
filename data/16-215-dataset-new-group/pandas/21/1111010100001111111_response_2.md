At first analysis, the issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) are treated by the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The buggy function seems to be handling different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to unexpected behaviors in some cases.

The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behaviors, such as raising errors for certain types of indexers and not others, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that different types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. This would involve aligning the behavior for list indexers with the behavior for array-like and Index indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, all the different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) are handled consistently by checking if the `key` is an instance of any of the specified types. If it is, the `_get_values_tuple` method is called to handle the key. Otherwise, for other types of keys, the function falls back to using `self.loc[key]` to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This change should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and fix the bug.
