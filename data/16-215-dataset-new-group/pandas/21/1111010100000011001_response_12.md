The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to return values based on the input `key`. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including the misclassification of key types and incorrect handling of different key types.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the misclassification of key types, resulting in the function returning unexpected results. This misclassification can lead to incorrect indexing and reindexing of the Series data.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to accurately classify the key type and handle each type appropriately, ensuring that the correct indexing method is used for each type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Determine the key type based on its inferred data type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for the data type of the key and implemented different handling based on the key type. This ensures that the correct indexing method is used for each type of key, preventing misclassification and incorrect results.
