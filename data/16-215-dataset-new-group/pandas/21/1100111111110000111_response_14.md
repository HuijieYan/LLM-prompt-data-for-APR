The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of indexers such as list, array-like, Index, and Series. When applying list indexers, the function raises a KeyError, which is inconsistent with how it handles other types of indexers.

The buggy function `_get_with` fails the test `test_getitem_no_matches`. The error occurs when using a list indexer, resulting in a KeyError that is not expected.

This bug is consistent with a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" where it is pointed out that different types of indexers are being treated inconsistently. The issue also highlights that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all types of indexers, which should not happen.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles all types of indexers consistently, without raising unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers the same way it handles other types of indexers, and it should pass the failing test. This fix also aligns with the discussion in the GitHub issue, aiming to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.
