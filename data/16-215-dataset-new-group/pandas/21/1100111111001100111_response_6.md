To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The current implementation causes the `_get_with` function to raise a KeyError for list indexers, while it does not for array-like indexers.

The key issue is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to array-like indexers. To resolve this, we should ensure that the function treats list indexers the same way it treats array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We replaced the condition `if not is_list_like(key)` with `elif is_list_like(key)`. This change ensures that list indexers are handled correctly without raising a KeyError.
- We removed the redundant type checks for Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, as the `is_list_like` condition covers them all.

This corrected version ensures consistent behavior for list and array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
