The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling different types of indexers correctly, which is leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors in specific cases. The function needs to handle different types of indexers consistently to avoid errors and ensure correct behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the cases that handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and non-list-like and non-array-like inputs.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, which is leading to errors in specific cases where the behavior should be consistent.

To fix the bug, we need to have a consistent approach to handle different types of indexers across all cases and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output values and types for all input cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the case for list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle all other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, I added a consistent handling for list indexers and all other cases to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output values and types for all input cases. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of indexers.
