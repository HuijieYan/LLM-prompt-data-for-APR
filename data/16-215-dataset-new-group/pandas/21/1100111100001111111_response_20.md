The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to how list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers. The GitHub issue indicates that the behavior of the function is inconsistent when using different types of indexers, leading to unexpected errors and inconsistencies.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of list-like key types. In the provided code, there is a section that checks if the key is list-like, and then attempts to handle various cases based on the type of the key. However, the code does not handle the case where the key is a list-like type as expected based on the GitHub issue.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function handles list-like key types consistently, regardless of the specific type of list-like key provided.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like key types
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, list)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            # Handle other cases, such as scalars
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    # The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the key is list-like using the `is_list_like` function, and handle the reindexing accordingly. This approach ensures that the function handles list-like key types consistently as discussed in the GitHub issue.
