The issue is caused by the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.

The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function include the conditional statements checking the type of the `key` input parameter and the handling of different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior. This is evident from the failing tests, which show that using a list indexer results in a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not.

To fix the bug, all indexers should be treated consistently, regardless of their type. This will ensure that the behavior is predictable and matches the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By treating all indexers consistently, regardless of their type, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
