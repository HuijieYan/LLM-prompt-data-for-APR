The bug in the _get_with function in the Series class of the pandas library is most likely caused by incorrect handling of the key_type variable, leading to KeyError in some cases.

In the provided test case, the key value is ['C'], and based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters, the key_type is inferred as 'string' in all cases. This indicates that the inferred key_type is not matching the actual type of the key.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for determining the key_type and ensure that it accurately reflects the type of the key. Additionally, we need to handle the different types of input keys and their corresponding actions in the function.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the key_type and conditions for different key input types accurately, which should resolve the issues causing the failing test cases. After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
