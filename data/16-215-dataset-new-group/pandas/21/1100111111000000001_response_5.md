One potential issue in the `_get_with` function is that it's trying to index the Series with an object that doesn't exist in the Series index, but instead of raising a KeyError, it's attempting to handle different types of input (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list) in sequence without an appropriate conditional handling for some of the input types. This can lead to the incorrect handling of inputs and a subsequent failure of the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional handling of different data types to ensure that the appropriate exception is raised when an input value does not exist in the Series index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        # raise KeyError if the key is not found in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' is not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # raise KeyError if any key is not found in the index
        for k in key:
            if k not in self.index:
                raise KeyError(f"The key '{k}' is not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected function, the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass without raising a KeyError.
