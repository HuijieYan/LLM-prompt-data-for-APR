The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. It looks like there is a mismatch between the expected type of the `key` and the actual type checking in the function.

The bug is causing the function to incorrectly handle the `key`, leading to a `KeyError` being raised in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, I would suggest updating the type checking in the function to correctly handle the different types of `key` parameters. Additionally, ensure that the function correctly distinguishes between label-based and positional indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the type checking issues and ensure that the function handles the `key` parameter correctly.
