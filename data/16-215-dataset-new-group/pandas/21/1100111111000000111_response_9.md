Based on the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list compared to when it is an array-like or an Index.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` attempts to access values from the `Series` using different types of indexers. When a list is used as the indexer, it raises a KeyError, but when array-like or Index are used, it returns NaN. This behavior is inconsistent and contradicts the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case of Index, which contains array-like elements
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)) or is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_dict_like(key):
        # handle the dict-like key allowing inference of the type of the indexer
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Otherwise, check if a boolean mask is used as an indexer, similar to loc
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.loc[list(key)]  # Convert to list for consistent behavior
```

This corrected version ensures that the behavior of `ser[key]` is consistent across different types of indexers, fixing the inconsistent behavior and addressing the reported issue in GitHub.
