To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The bug occurs in the section where key_type is determined and the corresponding action is taken based on that type. The bug is likely in the if-else conditionals where key_type is being assigned and used to determine whether to use `loc[]` or `iloc[]` to access the series values. 

The issue described on GitHub also highlights inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers, indicating that the bug we are trying to fix might be related to this inconsistency.

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (e.g., lists, arrays, Index objects) are handled consistently. We should also consider the behavior of the `loc[]` and `iloc[]` methods in conjunction with the different types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
        if key.empty:  # Handle case when the index is empty
            return self.reindex(key)

        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_integer(key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # For any other type of indexer
            return self.loc[key]
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function now ensures consistent treatment of different types of indexers and uses `loc[]`, `iloc[]`, or `reindex()` appropriately based on the type of the key.

These changes should resolve the bug and also align with the reported issue on GitHub.
