To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, you need to handle the case when the key is not found in the index as specified in the failing test. Since the test used different indexers such as lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series, we need to ensure that the behavior is consistent across all these cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        else:
            key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the issue described in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the failing test provided should pass without raising a KeyError.
