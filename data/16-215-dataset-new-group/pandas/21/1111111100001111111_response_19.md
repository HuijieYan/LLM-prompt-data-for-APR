Based on the GitHub issue and the analysis of the failing test cases, it appears that the issue stems from the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The bug occurs when using `ser[list(key)]`, which raises a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the behavior of list indexers so that it aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers and does not raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we removed the special handling for list indexers and combined the handling of array-like indexers and list indexers into the same else block. This change ensures that list indexers will behave consistently with the behavior of array-like indexers, and the KeyError will not be raised.
