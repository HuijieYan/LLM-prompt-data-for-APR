The issue with the function `_get_with` seems to be that it is incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` input, leading to the wrong behavior for different input types.

Looking at the different cases, it seems that the function incorrectly identifies the type of the `key` input as a string in all cases, even when it is a list, ndarray, or Index. This leads to the function taking the wrong path and ultimately causing the failing test.

To fix this issue, the function should correctly identify the type of the `key` input and handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` input and handles each type appropriately, addressing the issue that was causing the failing test.
