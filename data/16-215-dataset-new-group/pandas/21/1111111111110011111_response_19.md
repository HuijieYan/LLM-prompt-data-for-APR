To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that all indexers are treated consistently. Specifically, we need to handle the case when a list indexer is used and ensure it behaves consistently with other indexers.

The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function treats different types of indexers differently, causing inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the list indexer case consistently with other indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the bug is fixed.

By applying these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
