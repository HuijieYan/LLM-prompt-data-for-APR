The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the input `key`. Based on the provided code and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` when it is a list or ndarray. This leads to an incorrect path being taken in the function logic, resulting in the bug.

To fix this bug, a strategy is to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` input. In the cases provided, the input `key` is actually a list or ndarray, but it is being treated as a scalar value of type string. Therefore, the function needs better handling of list-like inputs.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, prior to the checks for `isinstance(key, list)` and `isinstance(key, Index)`, there is now a check for `is_list_like(key)` to properly handle array-like inputs.

By ensuring that the correct type of the `key` is identified, the function should now handle the input cases correctly and mitigate the bug.
