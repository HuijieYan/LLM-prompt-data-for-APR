The issue is in the `key_type` variable assignment. The `key_type` is determined using the `lib.infer_dtype` method, which seems to be incorrectly detecting the type of the key as `'string'` instead of `'object'` for all cases. This is causing the function to take the wrong code path and ultimately lead to the failure of the tests with a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the data type of the `key` parameter. We can update the `key_type` assignment to use the `dtype` attribute of the key, which should give us the correct type for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = getattr(key, 'dtype', None)
    if key_type is not None and key_type.kind in 'iu':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, `key_type` is assigned the data type of the `key` using `key.dtype`. This ensures that the correct type of key is determined, and the function takes the appropriate code path based on the key's data type.

After making these changes, the function should work correctly and pass the failing tests.
