The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle fancy indexing and categorize the input `key` into different types to handle them accordingly. However, there are several issues in the function related to type checking and handling specific cases.

The relevant error message for the failing test indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError`, as expected when using the `ser[key]` syntax.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. Inconsistencies related to type checks and handling of the `key` input.
2. The conditional blocks might not accurately categorize the type of the `key`.
3. Handling of specific cases, such as when the `key_type` is "integer" or "list".

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not categorize the type of `key` accurately and does not handle specific cases as expected. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior and failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to simplify the type checking and categorization of the `key` input, followed by handling specific cases with the appropriate operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (bool, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle the case for reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function uses simplified type checks to categorize the `key` input and handles the specific cases separately. This should resolve the issues with incorrect indexing behavior and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
