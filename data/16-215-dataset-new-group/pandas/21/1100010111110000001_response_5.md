The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to get items from the series based on the input key. However, it fails to handle the `is_list_like` check properly, resulting in a failing test with a KeyError.

The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function include:
1. Improper handling of the `is_list_like` condition.
2. Inappropriate return values when dealing with non-matching cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the key type, specifically when it is non-matching or fails the `is_list_like` check. This leads to an incorrect value being returned and causes the failing test with the KeyError.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to update the conditions that check for the key type and handle non-matching cases appropriately. Additionally, the function should be modified to return the expected value for different key types, ensuring that it doesn't result in a KeyError when accessed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, MultiIndex)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if is_bool(key):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_integer(key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

By making the changes mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle different key types appropriately and return the expected values without leading to a KeyError.
