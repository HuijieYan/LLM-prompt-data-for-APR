The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely to be caused by the conditional statement that checks the type of the `key` parameter and the subsequent assignment of the variable `key_type`. The cause of the bug may be related to an incorrect condition in checking the type of the `key` parameter or an issue with the `lib.infer_dtype` function used to determine the type of the `key`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to accurately check the type of the `key` parameter and ensure that the `key_type` variable assignment is correct. Additionally, we should handle the logic for different types of `key` in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Locating scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```
In the corrected version, the conditional statement checks for the correct types of the `key` parameter and the logic for determining the `key_type` is adjusted. Additionally, the handling of different types of `key` aligns with the expected behavior given the use case.

This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
