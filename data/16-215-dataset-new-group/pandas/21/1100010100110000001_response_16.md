The bug originates from the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class, which is not handling the list-like index objects properly. The method is attempting to index the Series using a list-like object, but it raises a `KeyError` instead of providing the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that when a list-like index object is encountered, it is not properly handled by the `_get_with` method. Consequently, when there is no match in the index, a `KeyError` is raised instead of the appropriate handling.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list-like index objects correctly when encountered in the `_get_with` method. We can use the `[]` indexing operation to select the items from the Series based on the list-like index object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:
```python
# The corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `[]` indexing operation to select the items from the `Series` based on the list-like index object. This addresses the bug and ensures that the `_get_with` method handles list-like index objects correctly.
