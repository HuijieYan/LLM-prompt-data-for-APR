To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers when used with the `Series` class. The issue is related to the different behaviors of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]` where the former returns `NaN` while the latter raises a `KeyError`.

The bug seems to originate from the section of the code that handles different types of key inputs, particularly the `is_list_like(key)` condition. The code fails to handle the list input (`is_list_like(key)` is `False` in the failing cases) which leads to the incorrect behavior.

We can resolve this issue by treating list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, and ensuring consistent behavior for all types of inputs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:  # handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
        return self.reindex(list(key))
```

In the corrected function, we've added an additional condition to handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all types of inputs.

With this fix, the function should behave consistently and meet the expected input/output values for all the given test cases. Additionally, it should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that list indexers are handled appropriately.
