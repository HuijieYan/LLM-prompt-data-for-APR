The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue with how it handles different types of indexers, which is causing inconsistencies in behavior. It fails to handle the `list` case properly, leading to a `KeyError` in some scenarios.

The potential error location is the section of code where different types of indexers are being handled, specifically the `elif not is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent conditional logic.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle the `list` case properly, leading to inconsistencies and a potential `KeyError`. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub issue where the behavior of different indexers is inconsistent.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function handles the `list` case in a consistent and correct manner, avoiding any potential `KeyError` and aligning with the expected behavior as detailed in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle non-list indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the `list`-like indexers separately and then proceed with handling non-list indexers. This approach ensures consistency and avoids potential `KeyError` situations.
