The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by inconsistent handling of indexers when using a list as the key. This results in a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to access elements that are not present in the series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists, arrays, and Index objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Use .loc for all indexers to ensure consistent behavior
    return self.loc[key]
```

By using `self.loc[key]` for all types of indexers, including lists, arrays, and Index objects, we ensure consistent behavior and resolve the KeyError issue.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" which addresses the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and behave consistently for all types of indexers.
