The `key_type` variable is being incorrectly determined as `'string'` in all cases. This is due to the `key` input being incorrectly processed. Based on the test cases, the `key_type` should be inferred based on the input `key` type and values.

The issue seems to lie in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block where the code tries to handle scalar values that aren't recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. Additionally, the handling of the `key_type` in the subsequent block needs to be revised to accurately infer the type.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the input `key` type and values. This may involve revising the condition checks and inference process for `key_type` within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like or scalar
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling scalar values and inferring the `key_type` has been updated to accurately reflect the type of input `key`. This should address the issue and enable the function to pass the failing test.
