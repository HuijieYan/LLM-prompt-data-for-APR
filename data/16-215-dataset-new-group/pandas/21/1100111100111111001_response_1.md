The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the key types. The function is not properly identifying the type of the key, leading to incorrect processing and ultimately failing the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled to return the expected output. Specifically, the function should handle different types of keys like string, list, ndarray, and Index appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper type handling for different types of keys and ensures that the expected output is returned.

By implementing the corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass as expected for all the given cases.
