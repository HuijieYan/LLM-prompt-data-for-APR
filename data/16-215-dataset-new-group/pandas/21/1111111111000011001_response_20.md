The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable, as it is assigned a value based on the type of `key` but is not used consistently throughout the function.

Based on the analysis provided, we can suggest the following strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `key_type` variable is correctly assigned and used consistently throughout the function.
2. Check the conditional statements for `key_type` and ensure that they are correctly evaluating the type of `key`.
3. Update the function to handle the `key_type` appropriately for each conditional branch.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Use key_type consistently throughout the conditional branches
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
       #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the type of `key` and use the `key_type` variable consistently to determine the return value based on the input type. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
