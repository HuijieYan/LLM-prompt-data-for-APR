The bug seems to be related to the `_get_with` function in the `pandas.core.series` class. This function should be able to retrieve values from the series based on the specified `key`, but it seems to run into issues when dealing with certain types of `key`.

Upon analyzing the `_get_with` function, it seems that the bug could be caused by the way it handles non-list-like keys. The function doesn't properly handle non-list-like keys, and it tries to access the element directly using 'loc' or 'iloc' which leads to a KeyError. This is causing the failing test case.

To fix this bug, you can rewrite the section of the code that handles the non-list-like keys to ensure proper handling of different types of keys.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added a check for scalar keys using the `is_scalar` function to ensure that the key is a scalar value before using `loc`. Additionally, we've replaced the check for `list` type with a more general approach using `ensure_index` which should properly handle non-list-like keys.

After making these changes, the `_get_with` function should be able to handle different types of keys properly and pass the failing test.
