The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the `key` parameter correctly. The bug is manifested by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` which expects a KeyError and a specific message when calling `ser[key]`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to redefine how the `_get_with` function handles the `key` parameter. It should first check if the key is indexable and handle it accordingly, rather than directly performing operations on the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```
In this correction, we first check if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple, and handle it accordingly. If it is a list-like object, we convert it to an index using `ensure_index` and then use the `loc` indexer to retrieve the data.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
