Based on the failing tests and the runtime values, it is evident that the bug lies in the `_get_with` function, particularly in the section that handles non-list-like keys. The issue arises when the key is not list-like and does not fall into any of the specified conditions.

In this case, we should handle the key as a scalar by using the `self.loc[key]` method for label-based indexing and `self.iloc[key]` for positional indexing.

We should also ensure that the key is converted to a list if it is not already list-like. Additionally, we need to check for the 'boolean' key type, which should be handled by the `com.is_bool_indexer` check in `__getitem__`.

Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_get_with` function can be fixed by updating it as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # New code to handle non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle non-list-like keys correctly and address the issue observed in the failing tests.
