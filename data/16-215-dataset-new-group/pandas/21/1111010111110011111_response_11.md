## Correction:

The issue with the `Series._get_with` function is that it does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing elements in a Series using list-like indexers.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle the list-like indexers in a consistent manner. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when accessing elements using a list-like indexer such as a Python list or a pandas Series.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles list-like indexers consistently and does not raise a `KeyError` when accessing elements using a list-like indexer. We can achieve this by modifying the conditional statements and the handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # Convert slice to positional or label-based and return the slice
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Access the element using loc if the key is not list-like
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        # Handle list-like indexers and reindex if necessary
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the corrected `Series._get_with` function will handle list-like indexers consistently and not raise a `KeyError` when accessing elements using a list-like indexer. This correction will address the inconsistency in the behavior of accessing elements using list-like indexers as reported in the GitHub issue.
