Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. The issue seems to be that when using a list key for indexing a Series, a KeyError is raised for the reindex method, while it should behave similarly to other array-like indexers.

The bug occurs when the input key is not recognized properly, leading to wrong type inference. This causes the function to return an incorrect type, leading to unexpected behavior, such as the KeyError raised for the reindex method.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would be to ensure that the type inference for the key is correctly handled, and that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the type inference for the key is handled properly using the `ensure_index` function. This should help in consistently handling different types of indexers, including list indexers, and avoid the KeyError issue for the reindex method.
