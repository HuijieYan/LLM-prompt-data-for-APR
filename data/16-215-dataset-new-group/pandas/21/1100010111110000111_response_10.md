The issue here seems to be related to how the `ser` Series is being indexed with different types of indexers, specifically a list indexer. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test is failing when the `ser` Series is indexed using a list indexer, resulting in a `KeyError` with the message indicating that none of the elements are in the index.

The buggy function `_get_with` contains a section that handles the case when `key` is not list-like. However, the logic for handling list-like indexers seems to be causing the bug.

The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, and suggests that this inconsistency might not be necessary. It also mentions that the test added in #5880 (presumably the `test_getitem_no_matches` test) broke when attempting to address this inconsistency.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function should be modified to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_scalar(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            pass

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The modified logic checks if `key` is list-like, and if so, uses `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing, ensuring consistent behavior for list-like indexers. This change should address the inconsistency and resolve the bug mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
