The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The error message states that the function did not raise a KeyError, indicating that the functionality of the function is not handling these inputs correctly.

The bug is likely in the condition:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
```

The function should be updated to handle indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, and appropriately raise a KeyError if necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # ... existing code

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list, ndarray, Index, and Series objects for key
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    try:
        result = self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError as e:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function performs the same actions as the original code, while also properly handling common indexable types such as lists, ndarrays, and Series. This version will raise a KeyError with a descriptive message if the index items are not found in the Series.

Remember to replace the original `_get_with` function with this corrected version in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
