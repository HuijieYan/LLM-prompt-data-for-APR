The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to the way it handles different types of indexers, particularly when using a list type indexer. This issue is reflected in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`. The test expects a specific behavior when using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) but the function fails to handle the list type indexer correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that when the input `key` is a list type, it is not being handled properly in the function, leading to the KeyError in the failing test. The expected behavior is that the function should handle list type indexers consistently with other types, such as ndarray, Index, or Series.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list type indexers more consistently with other types. Specifically, the code block for checking if `key` is a list type should be revised to handle the list type indexer appropriately.

Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the function `_get_with` is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function `_get_with` should handle list type indexers consistently with other types, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
