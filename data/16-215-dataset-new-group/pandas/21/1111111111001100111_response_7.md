## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others. However, it seems to have a problem with list indexers, as indicated by the failing test case. The issue in GitHub also confirms that there is inconsistent behavior when using list indexers.

From the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it's clear that the `key_type` is being incorrectly assigned the value `'string'`. This indicates that the logic for determining the `key_type` is incorrect, which may be leading to the inconsistent behavior with list indexers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for determining the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function. The logic should correctly identify the type of the `key` and then handle it appropriately for list indexers.

Based on the failing test case and the GitHub issue, it seems that all types of indexers should behave like the list case. Therefore, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list indexers and returns the expected result without raising a KeyError.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we've added a new condition for handling scalar keys. This ensures that scalar keys are directly located without raising a KeyError. Additionally, we've updated the handling of list indexers, ensuring they behave as expected and do not raise a KeyError. This should resolve the issue and make the function consistent with the expected behavior for different types of indexers.
