The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors and inconsistent handling of indexers, resulting in failed tests and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can handle all indexers consistently and ensure that the behavior is the same for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Unsupported indexer type for Series"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version handles all indexers consistently and ensures that the behavior is the same for all types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

After making this change, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
