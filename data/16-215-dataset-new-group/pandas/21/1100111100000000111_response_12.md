The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically array-like indexers versus list indexers. The issue in GitHub highlights that using `ser[pd.Index(key)]` and `ser[np.array(key)]` produce the expected result, while `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`. The reason for this behavior is not clear and seems inconsistent.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. We can achieve this by treating list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This means modifying the section of the code that handles list-like indexers to match the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensuring key is an index

    if key.is_boolean():
        # Use .loc for boolean indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensuring key is an index
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the conversion of list-like indexers to an index using the `ensure_index` function, and then treat them in the same way as array-like indexers.

This update ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
