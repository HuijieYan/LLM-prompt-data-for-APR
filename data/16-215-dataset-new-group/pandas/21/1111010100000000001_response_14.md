The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has a few potential error locations. Here's a breakdown:

1. The function checks if the `key` is a slice type, and if so, it calls `self._convert_slice_indexer` and returns the result of `self._slice(slobj)`. The potential for error here could be in the implementation of `_convert_slice_indexer` or `_slice` and whether they are handling slice types correctly.

2. After that, the function checks if the `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`. If it is, it raises a `TypeError`. This seems fine and doesn't contribute to the bug.

3. Next, the function checks if the `key` is a tuple and calls `self._get_values_tuple`. The potential for error here could be in the implementation of `_get_values_tuple`.

4. Then, the function checks if the `key` is not a list-like object, and if so, accesses the `loc` attribute with the `key`. The potential for error here could be if the `loc` attribute doesn't handle a non-list-like `key` correctly.

5. After that, the function checks if the `key` is an instance of `Index` and gets the `inferred_type`. The potential for error here could be in the implementation of the `inferred_type` method and whether it's classifying the `key` correctly.

6. Later, the function checks if the `key` type is "integer" and decides whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). The potential for error here could be if the decision-making process is incorrect.

7. Finally, the function reindexes the `key`, and the potential for error here could be in the implementation of the `reindex` method.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review each potential error location and ensure that the handling of `key` is done correctly at each step.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've used the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to handle scalar and list-like keys. Additionally, I've removed the redundant check for `key` being a list and simplified the conditional statements to handle different key types. This should address potential errors and make the function more robust.
