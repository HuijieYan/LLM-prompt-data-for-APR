The buggy function `_get_with` is causing a `KeyError` when attempting to access an item from the series. 

The issue is in the line `ser[key]` where it tries to access an item using a key, but it fails to do so, leading to a `KeyError`. This happens when the `key` is passed to the `_get_with` function.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the list-like keys properly and ensure that the keys truly belong to the index before using them. Additionally, we should handle different types of key inputs such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` independently in the `ser[key]` statement in order to ensure proper handling of these data types.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is a valid index

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError as e:
        raise e  # Reraise the KeyError
```

By adding a check to ensure the key is a valid index and wrapping the reindex call in a try-except block to catch and re-raise any `KeyError`, we can handle the KeyError situations more effectively. This should prevent the `KeyError` from occurring and thus, fix the bug.
