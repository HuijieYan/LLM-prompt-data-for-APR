The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` has a bug in handling the index when the key is a Series or one of its subclasses like DataFrame or Index. The bug causes the function to raise a KeyError in certain situations, as demonstrated by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.

The main cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the `key` parameter when it is a Series or one of its subclasses. Specifically, it doesn't properly convert `key` of type Series into a format that can be used to index the Series. As a result, when `key` is of pandas' Series type, the wrong condition is triggered, and the function tries to perform an index lookup operation that fails, hence raising the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case when `key` is a Series or any of its subclasses, and it converts it into a format that can be used for indexing the Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_object_dtype(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific condition to handle the case when `key` is a Series or a Scalar. When the key is a Series or a scalar, the function now uses the `loc` attribute to perform the indexing, which should prevent the KeyError issue and allow the function to correctly handle the key being a Series or any of its subclasses. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
