The buggy function `_get_with` has a conditional block that checks the type of the `key` input, and then selects the appropriate behavior based on the type. However, the conditional block does not handle the case where `key` is a list. This causes inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers, leading to the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block to handle the case where `key` is a list, and make it consistent with the behavior for other types of indexers. We also need to take into account the inconsistencies mentioned in the GitHub issue and make the behavior more consistent across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if key and isinstance(key[0], bool):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version handles the case where `key` is a list by converting it to a list if it's not already, and then checking the type of the elements in the list to determine the appropriate behavior. This ensures consistency in behavior across different types of indexers and addresses the failing test and the GitHub issue.
