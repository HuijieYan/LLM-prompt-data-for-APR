# The cause of the bug

The issue with the `_get_with` function is that the logic for handling list-like indexers is not consistent with the other types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing an error when using a list-like indexer in the function.

The GitHub issue further explains that the behavior for list indexers is different from array-like indexers, and this is causing inconsistency. The `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases mentioned in the GitHub issue. 

# Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the logic for handling list-like indexers should be made consistent with the logic for array-like indexers. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers and resolve the error caused by the inconsistency. 

Additionally, the error handling for list-like indexers should be adjusted to match the behavior of the other types of indexers, as per the requirements defined in the GitHub issue.

# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")  # Convert slice to positional
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `is_list_like` check is coupled with the `isinstance(key, Index)` check to ensure that the behavior for list-like indexers aligns with other indexers. Additionally, the type inference for the key has been updated to handle different types of indexers consistently.

By making these changes, the function should now handle list-like indexers as expected and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
