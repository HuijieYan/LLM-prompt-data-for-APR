The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in its handling of indexers and the inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers. The function is not properly identifying the type of the key and is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of indexers consistently and identifies the type of the key correctly to apply the appropriate logic. We also need to address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue regarding the behavior of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the check for `key_type == "integer"` and instead used the `lib.infer_dtype` function to correctly identify the type of the key. We have also made the handling of different types of indexers consistent to address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
