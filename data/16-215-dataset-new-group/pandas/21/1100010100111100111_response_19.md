The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the handling of list-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior and raising KeyError in certain cases. 

Looking at the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, we can identify that the issue occurs when using a list as the indexer. The function seems to be treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and KeyError in the mentioned scenario.

A possible strategy for fixing this bug would be to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers, and to address the specific case where a KeyError is being raised. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Ensure consistent handling for all list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure consistent handling for all array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list-like and array-like indexers consistently, which should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub discussion and pass the failing tests.
