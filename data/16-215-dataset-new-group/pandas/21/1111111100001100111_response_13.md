The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the Series class. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when using a list indexer, which is not the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers. This is evident from the GitHub issue where it is pointed out that using a list indexer raises a `KeyError`, while using array-like indexers does not.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers, and that the function does not raise a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # handle the case for non-list-like key
        if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for list-like indexers using the `is_list_like` function. If the key is list-like, it is directly used to access the elements using `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistent behavior for list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers. Additionally, we have removed the redundant type checks and streamlined the logic for handling different types of indexers.
