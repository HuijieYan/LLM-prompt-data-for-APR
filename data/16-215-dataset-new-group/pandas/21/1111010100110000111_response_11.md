The issue arises from the inconsistency when using different types of indexers, specifically when trying to access elements in a Series using a list indexer. The error message indicates that a KeyError is raised when none of the specified values are found in the index.

Looking at the source code for the `_get_with` function, the bug is likely due to the way different types of indexers are handled. When a list indexer is used, the function does not handle the case properly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, such as array-like, Index or Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing tests.
