To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The bug occurs when the function is passed a list-like key and tries to access the corresponding values from the Series. The key is treated differently depending on its type, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError in some cases.

To address this issue, we will modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys consistently, regardless of their type. We will also ensure that the function processes the key appropriately based on its type, without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function will handle list-like keys consistently, regardless of their type. It will also process the key appropriately based on its type, resolving the inconsistent behavior and ensuring that a KeyError is not raised.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected for list, ndarray, Index, and Series types when used as keys for indexing a Series.
