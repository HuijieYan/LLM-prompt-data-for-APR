The issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the Series class. When using the list indexer, it raises a KeyError, while the other indexers return NaN without raising an error. The bug is likely in the _get_with function, specifically in the section that handles list-like input.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list-like input correctly, and it is raising a KeyError when it should not. This behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers are handled and is not aligned with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the _get_with function to handle list-like input in a way that is consistent with the other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    indexers = [np.asarray(key)] if is_list_like(key) else [key]
    
    return self._get_values(indexers)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the key is list-like using the is_list_like function and then converts it to an array if necessary. It then calls the _get_values function to handle the indexing, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
