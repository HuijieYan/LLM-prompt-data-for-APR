To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated. Currently, when using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` due to the `None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')]` error. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexer types such as array-like indexers and `pd.Index` indexers.

We need to ensure that the behavior is consistent across all types of indexers, and that using a list indexer does not result in a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Remove the check for is_list_like(key) and return self.loc[key] directly
    return self.loc[key]
```

By removing the `is_list_like(key)` check and directly returning `self.loc[key]`, we ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers, thus resolving the inconsistency and fixing the bug.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated.
