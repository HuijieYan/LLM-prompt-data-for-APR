The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the case when the key is not found in the index. Based on the failing tests, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key when it's not found in the index, resulting in a KeyError that suggests the key is not in the index, when in fact it is.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified and handled when it's not found in the index. We should also ensure that the KeyError message accurately reflects the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case when the key is not in the index
    if not self.index.isin([key]).any():
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to see if the key is not in the index using `self.index.isin([key]).any()`. If the key is not found in the index, a KeyError is raised with the appropriate message. This should correctly handle the case when the key is not in the index and ensure that the failing tests pass.
