The error was raised from the `test_getitem_no_matches` method in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file. It appears that the `ser[key]` is not raising a `KeyError` as it was expected.

The issue seems to be related to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, and the series being indexed using a key that does not exist in the index. The function `_get_with` seems to be attempting to handle various types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, and index objects. However, it seems it's not correctly handling pandas Series objects.

Given that the error message suggests that the key doesn't exist in the index, it's likely due to incorrect handling of the given key in the `_get_with` function. The bug may be occurring in the block of code within the `elif not is_list_like(key):` condition. It seems that within this block, the code incorrectly invokes `self.loc[key]` on a key that would result in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, I will modify the `_get_with` function to handle the given key correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
