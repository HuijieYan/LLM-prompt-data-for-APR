To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, it seems like the cause is related to how the key is being processed. The key is expected to be a string, but it is being recognized as a list or an ndarray in some cases.

The `key_type` is being set to `'string'` but it seems like it is not being correctly identified as a string.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly identify the type of the key and ensure that it is treated as a string when necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
  
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string" or is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I've separated the checks for key types and processed them accordingly. I've also added additional checks to handle cases where the key is a scalar or a string, as it was previously expected. This should address the issue of identifying the key type correctly and processing it accordingly.
