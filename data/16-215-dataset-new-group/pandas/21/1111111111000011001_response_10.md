Based on the given buggy function and failing test, the issue seems to be in how the function is determining the type of the key for indexing. The key_type variable is being set to the result of lib.infer_dtype or key.inferred_type, and then used to determine the type of indexing to perform. However, there seems to be an issue with how the key type is being inferred, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred before using it to decide the type of indexing to perform.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the type of the key before using it to decide the type of indexing to perform. Additionally, we handle the case of list indexing separately to avoid the KeyError issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
