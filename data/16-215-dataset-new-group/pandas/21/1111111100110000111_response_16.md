The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of indexers, but it fails to do so, resulting in inconsistent behavior and a KeyError. The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the input key is of type list, which leads to the failure of the test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle different types of indexers, including lists. We can do this by explicitly checking for the `list` type and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        else:  # handle the case when key is a list
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added an explicit check for the `list` type and handle it by returning `self.loc[key]`.

This fix should address the inconsistent behavior and prevent the KeyError that was reported in the failing test cases. After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function will handle different types of indexers consistently, and the failing test should pass.
