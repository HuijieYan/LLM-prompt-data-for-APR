The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to different behaviors when indexing with a list, array-like, or pandas Index object. The function raises an error when indexing with a list, which differs from the behavior when indexing with an array-like or pandas Index object.

The failing test cases show that when calling `ser[key]` with `key` being a list, it raises a `KeyError`, which does not align with the expected behavior.

The issue in the GitHub post also mentions the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers and pandas Index objects when used with the `Series`. The issue raised the question of whether there is a compelling reason for this inconsistency.

Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects, leading to failing test cases and GitHub discussions.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the case when the `key` is a list to align with the behavior for array-like indexers and pandas Index objects. This can be achieved by updating the conditional block that checks if the `key` is not list-like. The updated block should handle the case when `key` is a list and align the behavior with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle the case when key is list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    # For other types of indexers, fall back to reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the case when `key` is list-like, aligning it with the behavior for array-like indexers and pandas Index objects. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
