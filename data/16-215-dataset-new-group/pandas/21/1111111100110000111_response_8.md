The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list-like indexers. The issue arises when using a list indexer, which is treated differently from other array-like indexers. The test for this behavior was added in a previous update, and it's causing inconsistency with the other cases.

The cause of the bug is related to the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function, which handles the different types of indexers. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the handling of list-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic for handling the different types of indexers needs to be revised. The goal is to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, including list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic has been adjusted to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and the failing test.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of indexers consistently, aligning with the expected behavior as discussed in the GitHub issue.
