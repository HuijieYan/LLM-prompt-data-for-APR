The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys and the determination of the `key_type`. The key_type seems to be incorrectly identified as `'string'` regardless of the type of key provided.

The code also seems to have a bug in how it handles non-list-like keys, as it always falls back to using `self.loc[key]`, which can cause issues when the key is an Index or a single value.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key and handle different types of keys accordingly. We also need to handle non-list-like keys in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or is_integer(key):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version improves key type identification and handles different types of keys more robustly. This version should pass the failing test cases.
