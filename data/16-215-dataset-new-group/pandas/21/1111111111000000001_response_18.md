The `KeyError` in the failing test indicates that there is no match for the key `C` in the index of the series.

Looking at the `_get_with` function, we can see that there is a check for whether `key` is not list-like, and if so, it falls through to `self.loc[key]`. However, this check is incorrect because `key` is derived from the series and it's always list-like. As a result, it doesn't pass through the correct checks for index matching, resulting in the `KeyError`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to remove the check for `not is_list_like(key)` and use the correct indexing method for the given `key` to avoid the issue with the mismatch.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Remove the is_list_like check and use the correct index method
    # to avoid the KeyError
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass successfully without raising a `KeyError`.
