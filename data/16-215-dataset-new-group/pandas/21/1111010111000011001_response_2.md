The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly determines the `key_type` by using `lib.infer_dtype` and comparing it with "integer" to decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing. This leads to incorrect behavior, as it does not account for non-integer types that should be treated as label-based indexing.

To fix this bug, we can use the `com.should_use_pos_based_int_indexer` function to decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing. This function is specifically designed to handle non-integer types for label-based indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_extension_array_dtype(key) or is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we use `is_bool` to check for boolean types and use `is_extension_array_dtype` and `is_object_dtype` to handle non-integer label-based indexing. This will ensure that the function correctly uses label-based indexing for the expected input types.

This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
