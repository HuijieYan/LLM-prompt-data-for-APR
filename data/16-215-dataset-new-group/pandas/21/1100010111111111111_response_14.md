The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to an inconsistency in the handling of indexers when accessing a Series with different types of indexers. The main issue arises with the `ser[list(key)]` case, which raises a `KeyError`, while other indexers do not.

The bug is caused by the if-else conditions in the function handling the different types of indexers inconsistently. The `list` case is not being handled correctly, leading to the `KeyError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for the `list` case and ensure that it is handled similarly to other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `is_list_like(key)` condition and the subsequent try-except block handle the case when `key` is a list-like object, similar to how other indexers are handled. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves consistently for different types of indexers.
