The buggy function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. The issue description also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, indicating that there is a bug in how list indexers are being handled. 

The bug is likely in the section of the code where list indexers are being processed. This part of the code is not properly handling list-like indexers, which is leading to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this correction, when the key is a list, we explicitly identify it as a list type and handle it accordingly. This should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.
