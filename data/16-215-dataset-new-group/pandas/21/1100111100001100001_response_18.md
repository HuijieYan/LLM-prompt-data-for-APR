Looking at the buggy function, it seems to be designed to handle different types of input for the `key` parameter, and then return a specific type of value based on the type of `key`.

The potential error location seems to be in the logic for determining the `key_type`. It attempts to infer the type of the `key` based on its input, but the inferred type is consistently set to `'string'` regardless of the actual type of `key`.

The cause of the bug is that the `key_type` is not being properly inferred based on the type of the `key`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revise the logic for inferring the `key_type` by accurately checking the type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            key_type = 'unknown'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I revised the logic for inferring the `key_type` by properly checking the type of the `key` using `isinstance` and `type` checks, and then updated the subsequent conditional blocks accordingly. This should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly handle different types of input for the `key` parameter.
