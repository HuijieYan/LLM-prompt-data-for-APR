The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to occur in the logic for identifying the type of the key. The function fails to correctly infer the type of the key, leading to unexpected behavior. It is important to correctly identify the type of the key in order to handle different types of input properly.

The issue seems to be occurring in the cases where the key is a list or array. The function incorrectly identifies the type of the key as a string, regardless of its actual type. This leads to the incorrect execution of subsequent logic based on the inferred key type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified for different types of input. This can be achieved by using appropriate type-checking methods and ensuring that the inferred type aligns with the actual type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that the key type is correctly identified, and the subsequent logic is executed based on the actual type of the key. This should resolve the issue with incorrectly identifying the key type and ensure that the function handles different types of inputs properly.
