There are some issues with the `_get_with` function. The function receives a `key` parameter and performs various checks and operations based on the type of the `key`. However, it seems to be incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` and subsequently handling it. This leads to a failure in tests where various types of inputs are used.

The possible cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` when it tries to execute different conditional blocks based on the type of the `key`.

To fix this, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` and executes the appropriate block of code for each type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We've added a check for scalar values (e.g., single number or string) using `is_scalar(key)`.
- We've kept the checks for `Index`, `integer`, and `list` types and modified the conditional blocks to handle each case properly.

This corrected version ensures that the function identifies the type of the `key` correctly and executes the appropriate code for each type, thereby fixing the bug.
