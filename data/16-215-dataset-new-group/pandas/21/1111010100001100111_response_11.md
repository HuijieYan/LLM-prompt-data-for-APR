The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how list indexers are treated differently from other indexers, causing inconsistent behavior and raising errors in some cases.

The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to errors when trying to use a list as an index. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other indexers, ensuring that the behavior is predictable and does not raise errors when using a list as an index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the condition for handling list indexers has been modified to ensure that the behavior is consistent with other indexers, preventing errors when using a list as an index.

This should resolve the issue of inconsistent behavior and errors when using list indexers, addressing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
