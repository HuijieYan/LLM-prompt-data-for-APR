The issue posted on GitHub highlights the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the context of the `Series` class. The specific problem is that when a list indexer is used, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` for values that do not match any index.

### Bug Identification
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs and perform the necessary indexing operations. However, based on the provided test cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in the handling of list indexers.

The issue occurs when using a list indexer with the `ser[list(key)]` syntax. The function does not return `NaN` for values that do not match the index, but instead raises a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in a manner consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and the raising of a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This means ensuring that when a list indexer is used, the function should return `NaN` for values that do not match the index, rather than raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling list indexers has been modified to return `NaN` for values that do not match the index, consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
