The issue seems to be related to the behavior of different indexers in the `ser[key]` operation, specifically when `key` is provided as a list. The test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is failing when `key` is a list, resulting in a KeyError. The expected behavior is to return NaN for all the cases, which is consistent with the behavior observed when `key` is provided as an index, a NumPy array, or a Pandas Series.

The offending part of the code seems to be the logic related to list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function should be updated to handle list-like indexers in the same way as index, NumPy array, and Pandas Series indexers. 

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic for handling list-like indexers, making it consistent with the behavior observed for other types of indexers.

Based on the analysis and strategy, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the logic for handling list-like indexers has been updated to handle it in a way consistent with the behavior observed for other types of indexers, and it should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".
