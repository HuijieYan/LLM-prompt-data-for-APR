The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The if-elif-elif-else statement is not handling the different types of indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior.
2. The code for handling the list case is causing an error when accessing the index with no matches.

The cause of the bug is:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle the different types of indexers (such as list, array-like, and Index) consistently, leading to inconsistent behavior and errors when trying to access the index with no matches.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles the different types of indexers consistently and addresses errors when accessing the index with no matches.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version of the function `_get_with`, we have removed the handling for specific types of indexers and instead used a more generalized approach to ensure consistent behavior and handle the index with no matches. This should fix the inconsistent behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
