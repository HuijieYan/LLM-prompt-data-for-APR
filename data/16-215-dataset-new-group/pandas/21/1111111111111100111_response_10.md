The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the case where a list-like key is used to index a Series. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like key correctly and consistently with other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the list-like key correctly and consistently with other types of indexers.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
