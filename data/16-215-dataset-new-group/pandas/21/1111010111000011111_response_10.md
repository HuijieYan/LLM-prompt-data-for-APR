To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The issue arises from the fact that a KeyError is raised when using a list indexer, but not when using other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. This is evident in the failing test, where a KeyError is expected when using a list key, but not when using other array-like keys.

To resolve the bug, we should make all array-like indexers behave consistently, and ensure that the function handles different types of indexers in a uniform manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle different types of indexers uniformly, eliminating the inconsistency in behavior. The function now checks if the key is array-like or not, and then proceeds accordingly to ensure consistent behavior.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
