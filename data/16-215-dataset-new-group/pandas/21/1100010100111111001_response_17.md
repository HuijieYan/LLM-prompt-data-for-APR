The bug in the function can be identified by the use of improper type checking and indexing methods. The function mistakenly assumes that the `key` variable is always a list-like object, which leads to incorrect indexing. To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of input `key`, and improve the type checking to avoid unexpected behaviors.

The bug can be fixed by:
1. Adding proper type checks for `key` in the initial if statements.
2. Updating the logic to handle different types of input `key` appropriately.
3. Ensuring that the correct indexing method (i.e., `loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of `key` and the index type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, pd.Series) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the fixed version:
- We have replaced the checks for `ABCDataFrame` and `is_list_like` with more specific checks for `pd.DataFrame`, `pd.Series`, `pd.Index`, and `list`.
- We have added an additional check for scalar values and directly used `loc` to access the elements.
- We have updated the conditional statements based on the `key_type` inferred from the input `key`.
- We have ensured that correct indexing methods `loc` and `iloc` are used based on the type of the input `key`.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for different types of input `key`.
