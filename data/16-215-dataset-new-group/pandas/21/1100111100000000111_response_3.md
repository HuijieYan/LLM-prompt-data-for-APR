## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` module. It's called to retrieve values from a `Series` object using various types of keys, including slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, and arrays.

The GitHub issue is related to inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The issue describes the behavior of the `ser[list(key)]` notation raising a `KeyError` while other types of indexing do not. This inconsistency has been pointed out in the GitHub issue, and a test case demonstrates the inconsistency.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are where the different types of `key` are being handled and selected for retrieval.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the GitHub issue information

The bug in the `_get_with` function causes inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list. The issue points out that using `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError` while other types of indexing do not exhibit this behavior. This indicates that the bug lies in the handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with lists, arrays, and other types of keys. It is also important to address the specific use case highlighted in the GitHub issue to ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "list"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- The handling of list-like keys has been modified to ensure consistent behavior.
- The `isinstance(key, list)` check is separated from the other type checks to handle list-like keys specifically.
- The `key_type` is set to "list" for list-like keys to ensure they are handled correctly.
- The conditional checks for "integer" and "list" indices have also been modified to ensure that the correct behavior is applied based on the type of key.
