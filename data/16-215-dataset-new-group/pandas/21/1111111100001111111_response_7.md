The issue lies in the `_get_with` function's conditional statements. It does not handle all the cases correctly. Specifically, when the key is a list and the `is_list_like` function does not recognize it as a list, the current conditional statement does not properly handle this case.

In each of the test cases, the expected return value of `key_type` is a string representing the type of the key. The key type is determined by using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, given the input `key`. However, the bug might be caused by `is_list_like` function not correctly recognizing the input `key` as a list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements and handle the case where a key is a list and is not recognized as a list by the `is_list_like` function. We can also make use of the `isinstance` function to check for the type of the key directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle the different types of keys and return the expected values based on their types. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
