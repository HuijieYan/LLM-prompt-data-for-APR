Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue arises due to inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers, particularly when using a list as an indexer.

The bug occurs when using a list key to index a Series, resulting in a KeyError. This is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers, such as a Series, numpy array, or Index.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with(key)` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the key is an Index-like object before checking its inferred type. This should provide consistent behavior when using list-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and the KeyErrors in the provided cases.

By making this change, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
