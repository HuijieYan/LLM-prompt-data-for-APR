The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is likely causing the failing tests due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

In the failing tests, the following types of indexers are being used: list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The expectation is that the behavior should be consistent when using different types of indexers, but the current implementation is causing discrepancies.

Based on the error messages, it seems that the issue arises when using a list as an indexer, leading to a `KeyError`. This is not consistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers, such as Index or ndarray.

The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" describes the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and suggests that the behavior should be made consistent for all cases.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers consistently, regardless of whether they are lists, ndarrays, Index objects, or Series.

Here's the corrected and updated version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
```
In the corrected version, the function checks if the key is of type list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. For these types, it uses `self.loc[key]` directly. If the key is not of any of these types, it assumes that it's a slice and proceeds with slicing operations.

This approach ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By implementing this corrected version of the function, the failing tests should pass, and the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers will be consistent as expected.
