The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the Series class. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when accessing elements with a list key, as demonstrated in the GitHub issue.

The buggy function `_get_with` attempts to handle different types of indexers (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple, boolean, integer, etc.) and decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing by inferring the key type. However, the inconsistency in handling list indexers may be due to the conditional check for list-like key types and the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, the conditional handling of list indexers needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to align the behavior with other array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e., self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":  # Add a conditional block for string key types
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The revised version includes an additional conditional block for handling string key types. If the `key_type` is identified as "string," the function returns the result of `self.loc[key]`. This change ensures that string key types are handled consistently along with other array-like indexers.
