To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function. It should handle all index types consistently to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, ABCSeries)):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # handle all other cases, including non-list-like iterables
        return self.loc[key]
```

By handling all index types consistently and including a catch-all for other cases, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
