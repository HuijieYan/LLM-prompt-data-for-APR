The cause of the issue is that the buggy function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing elements in a Series.

The bug can be fixed by treating all types of indexers uniformly, so that there is consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer being used.

The corrected version of the function `_get_with` is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # For other types of indexers, simply use reindex to handle the operation
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will treat all types of indexers uniformly, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
