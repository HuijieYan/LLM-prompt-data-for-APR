The bug in the provided function is causing a failure in the tests due to an incorrect key handling process. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and determining the appropriate action based on that type.

The bug primarily lies in the logic for determining the `key_type`. The incorrect determination of `key_type` is leading to incorrect handling of the key, resulting in failed tests.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining `key_type` and appropriately handle the key based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle the input keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
