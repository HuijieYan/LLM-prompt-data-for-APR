The root cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` incorrectly handles list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors for list indexers. This is in contrast to other array-like indexers, which do not raise errors. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior for all types of array-like indexers.

To fix the bug:
- The function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, without raising errors.
- The behavior of the function should be consistent for all types of array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # For all other array-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all other cases, including scalars
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all array-like indexers, including lists, are handled consistently without raising errors. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values as well as resolve the reported GitHub issue.
