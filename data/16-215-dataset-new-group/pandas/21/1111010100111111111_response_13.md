Based on the failing test information and the explanations, it appears that the bug is related to how the function handles different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when accessing a Series object. The issue in the GitHub report also confirms that there are inconsistencies in how these different types of indexers are handled.

After analyzing the code, it seems that the bug may be caused by the function not handling list-like indexers properly and raising a KeyError when trying to access a key with a list indexer.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the function handles list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. Specifically, it should handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to maintain consistency. This will involve modifying the code to handle list-like indexers properly without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to handle list-like indexers properly before determining the key type and performing the appropriate indexing.

By making these changes, the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, and the failing tests should pass as expected. This should also address the issue reported on GitHub.
