The bug in the function `_get_with` stems from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. The issue lies in the differentiation between list indexers and other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer, whereas other array-like indexers do not raise an error.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key` is converted to ensure it behaves consistently across different types of indexers. Additionally, the handling of list indexers has been aligned with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the function behaves uniformly across different types of indexers.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
