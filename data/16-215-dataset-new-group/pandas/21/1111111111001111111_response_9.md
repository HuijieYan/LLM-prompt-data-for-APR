The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The function should handle the case when the key is a list, array-like, or Series indexers in the same way. The existing implementation raises a KeyError in some cases, which is inconsistent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that it returns the expected output for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # handle all other cases
    else:
        if is_scalar(key):
            key = [key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function will handle all types of indexers consistently and return the expected output for the failing test case and any other similar cases. This fix resolves the issue reported on GitHub and ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
