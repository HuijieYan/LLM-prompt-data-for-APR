The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different actions based on the type. The bug may be occurring in the section where it checks for the type of `key` and assigns a value to `key_type`.

The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect value or raise an error, as seen in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. The expected behavior is not being met, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly assigned according to the type of the `key` parameter and that the function performs the appropriate actions based on the type of `key`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle the case where key is an Index
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle the case where key is a list
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    # If none of the previous conditions are met, reindex the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the assignment of `key_type` based on the type of `key` is handled correctly, and the appropriate actions are taken based on the type of `key`. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
