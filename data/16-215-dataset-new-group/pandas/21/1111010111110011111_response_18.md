The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be failing due to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers for Series. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised, but it is not being raised, indicating that there is an issue with how list indexers are handled in the function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other indexers like array-like indexers. This inconsistency is leading to the incorrect output and the test failure.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistency across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and exhibit consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
