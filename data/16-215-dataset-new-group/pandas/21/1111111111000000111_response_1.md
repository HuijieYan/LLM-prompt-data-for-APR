The identified potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the handling of different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not treating list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. This inconsistency in handling list indexers results in the KeyError being raised when using a list indexer to access elements that are not in the index. 

To fix the bug, modify the conditional statements to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This would align the behavior of list indexers with the behavior of other types of indexers, and resolve the KeyError issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        # Use positional indexer for integer and boolean keys
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # Use label-based indexer for all other cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures that list indexers are treated in the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency in behavior and fixing the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
