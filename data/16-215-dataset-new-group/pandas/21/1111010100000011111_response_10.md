The bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The bug occurs when indexing with a list, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

The cause of the bug is that when the key is not recognized as list-like, a call to `self.loc[key]` is made. However, the problem is that a `KeyError` is raised in the case of a list indexer with no matches, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to handle list indexers similarly to array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function now handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue of inconsistent behavior reported on GitHub.
