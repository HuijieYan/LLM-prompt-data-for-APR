Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message:

The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to retrieve the value of the Series object at the specified key. However, based on the error messages, it is failing to correctly handle cases where the specified key is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or a pandas Series.

Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

The problem may arise from the `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` check which should be replaced with an `isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries))` to also handle the case where `key` is an instance of a pandas Series object. Additionally, the section where the `key` variable is converted into a list using `key = list(key)` is likely causing issues.

Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the corresponding error message:

The `_get_with` function is not able to handle the specified key being either a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or a pandas Series, as evidenced by the test failures and the associated error messages.

Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, modify the control flow to properly handle the cases where the key is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or a pandas Series. This likely involves rewriting the conditional statements and ensuring that the key is properly handled before attempting to retrieve the value from the Series.

Given the buggy function and the identified issues, below is the corrected version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # Convert the key to a list
        key = list(key)
  
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional checks have been modified to handle cases where the key is a list, numpy array, or a pandas Series, ensuring that the correct value is retrieved from the Series object.
