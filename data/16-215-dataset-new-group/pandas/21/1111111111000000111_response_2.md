The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using list indexers as compared to array-like indexers. The issue is that when using a list indexer, an error is raised, while array-like indexers do not throw an error. This inconsistency is also reflected in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, which expects the behavior to be the same for list/ndarray/Index/Series.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers is not consistent and is leading to errors with list indexers. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" is being raised when using list indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks and logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers, particularly for the case of list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        return self._get_positional_indexer(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the conditional checks have been updated to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers, and the corrected function should fix the bug and allow the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` to pass.
