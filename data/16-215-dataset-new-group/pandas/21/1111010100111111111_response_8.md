The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a KeyError in certain cases, as highlighted in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in the same way as it handles array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and the KeyError being raised.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is the same in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the key is scalar (single value) using `is_scalar`, and if it is, it uses `self.loc[key]` to handle it as a label-based indexer. Additionally, it handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers by using `is_list_like` and converting to a list if needed.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
