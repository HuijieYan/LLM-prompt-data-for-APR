The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from the pandas module is causing an inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. Specifically, when trying to index a Series with a list containing no matches, it raises a `KeyError`, which is not the case with array-like indexers. This behavior is inconsistent and does not align with the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is in the conditional statements handling different types of indexers. The code does not properly handle the case where a list indexer returns no matches, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, ensuring that a `KeyError` is not raised when a list indexer returns no matches.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key, copy=False)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, specific handling for list indexers has been added to ensure that when a list indexer returns no matches, it does not raise a `KeyError` and behaves consistently with array-like indexers. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
