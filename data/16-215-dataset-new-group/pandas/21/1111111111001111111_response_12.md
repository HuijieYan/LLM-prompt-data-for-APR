# The buggy function explanation
The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series. However, there are multiple issues with the current implementation.

1. In the case where `key` is a list, the function attempts to handle it differently than other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError in certain cases.

2. The function incorrectly infers the type of the index, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing the elements of the Series.

3. The function also fails to handle the case where `key` is not list-like and should be accessed using `.loc`.

# Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle different types of indexers consistently and correctly infer the type of the index. Additionally, we need to handle non-list-like keys and access them using `.loc` to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # handle non-list-like keys using .loc
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that non-list-like keys are accessed using `.loc` to provide the expected behavior.

This fix should address the issues reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently across different types of indexers.
