The potential error locations within the _get_with function could be in the conditions under the first `if` statement. The wrong conditions can lead to the wrong execution path within the function.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions to identify the type of the key variable are incorrect, which may lead to the wrong execution path and return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the conditions to correctly identify the type of the key variable.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and (is_scalar(key[0]) or isinstance(key[0], slice))):
            # For scalar or list-like values with scalar elements
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

Please note that the modifications include additional checks for the `key` variable and using `loc` instead of `iloc` to get the correct results. Further modifications may be required depending on the specific use cases of the _get_with function.
