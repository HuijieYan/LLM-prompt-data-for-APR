The bug in the _get_with function is related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the Series class. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers, which causes the function to raise a KeyError in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _get_with function to handle the list indexer case consistently with other array-like indexers. We can also ensure that the function follows the same behavior as the example provided in the GitHub issue and that it does not raise a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if not self.index.is_unique or len(key) != len(np.unique(key)):
                return self.reindex(key)
            return self._get_values(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of list indexers to ensure that it behaves consistently with array-like indexers. We also added a condition to check for unique values in the index and call the _get_values method accordingly.

This should resolve the inconsistency issue and prevent the KeyError from being raised when using list indexers.
