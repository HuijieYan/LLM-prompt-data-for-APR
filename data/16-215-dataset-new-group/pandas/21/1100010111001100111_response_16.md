To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to make sure that the behavior of handling list indexers is consistent with the behavior of handling array-like indexers. Based on the runtime values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the inconsistency arises when using a list as an indexer, which leads to a KeyError.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to handle list indexers in a consistent manner as array-like indexers, such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.
2. Ensure that the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` is consistent for all types of indexers.

Based on the analysis and the strategy for fixing the bug, here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle non-list-like indexers
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            # Handle list or array-like indexers
            return self.reindex(key)  # Use reindex for consistent behavior
        else:
            # Handle other types of indexers
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            return self.reindex(key)
```

The above corrected version of the function handles different types of indexers more consistently and should address the issue reported in the GitHub. It ensures that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers and that `ser.loc[key]` is consistent for all cases.

Please note that the function has been modified based on the analysis provided. It would be best to integrate this corrected version into the pandas library and run the failing tests to verify that this fix resolves the issue.
