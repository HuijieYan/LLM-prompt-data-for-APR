The buggy function fails to handle indexers that are of type list properly, leading to inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors. The `key_type` variable is not being assigned the correct value when `key` is of type list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct key_type is assigned based on the type of the input key. Additionally, we need to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary check for isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) and assigned the `key_type` based on the inferred type of `key`. We then use this `key_type` to handle the indexing behavior accordingly. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors related to list indexers.
