The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be caused by the inconsistent handling of indexers. The GitHub issue also highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle indexers consistently, regardless of their type. The function should treat all types of indexers in the same manner, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across the board.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the specific checks for `DataFrame`, `Index`, and non-iterable types, and instead, we unify the treatment of indexers based on their type. Also, we handle the `"string"` type as a positional or label-based indexer.

By ensuring consistent handling of indexers, the bug should be fixed, and the function should work as expected for all types of inputs, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
