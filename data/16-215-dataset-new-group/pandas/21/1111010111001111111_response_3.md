The issue stems from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior with array-like indexers. This causes `ser[list(key)]` to raise a `KeyError` while the other indexers do not.

The cause of the bug is due to the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function, as it does not properly handle list indexers. The function incorrectly categorizes the key type as `'string'` when it should recognize it as an array-like indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle list indexers correctly and categorize the key type accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle list indexers correctly
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = [x for x in key if x in self.index]
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the rest of the indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we first handle list indexers by filtering out any values not present in the index, then reindexing the Series with the filtered list. For other types of indexers, we use the `self.loc` method to fetch the values.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now handle list indexers correctly and exhibit consistent behavior across different types of indexers, resolving the issue.
