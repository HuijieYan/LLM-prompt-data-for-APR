The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and an error when using a list indexer. The key_type is being incorrectly inferred for list indexers, leading to the KeyError when dealing with a list key.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to treat all indexers consistently and fix the inference of the key_type for list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version uses `ensure_index` to properly handle all types of indexers, including list indexers. This change ensures consistent behavior and resolves the KeyError when using a list indexer.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub about inconsistent behavior in handling indexers.
