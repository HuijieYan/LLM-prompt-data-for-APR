The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the handling of indexers when the input is a list. Based on the failing test cases and the expected values, it seems that the function is not properly handling list indexers, resulting in a `KeyError` when accessing the Series.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers. This should resolve the `KeyError` and make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By checking if the `key` is not a list-like object or if it's an array or an Index, we can then call the `reindex` or `loc` method accordingly to handle the indexing operation consistently.

This should resolve the inconsistency and the `KeyError` when using list indexers, making the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.
