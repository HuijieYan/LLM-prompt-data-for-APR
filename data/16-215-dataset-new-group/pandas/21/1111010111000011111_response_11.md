## Problem analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others. It tries to determine the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. However, the bug seems to occur when handling a list-like `key` parameter, as indicated by the failing test.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the index. It checks that the correct `KeyError` is raised when using various types of indexers, including a list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series. The failing test indicates that the bug is specific to the list-like key parameter case.

The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution show that the `key_type` variable is expected to be of type `str` with a specific value. This provides a clue that the issue is related to the determination of the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter.

The GitHub issue further confirms the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, and it suggests that the behavior for all cases should be aligned with the list case.

## Bug description
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling a list-like `key` parameter for indexing a Series. When using a list-like key, the function does not handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError` instead of behaving consistently with other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is related to determining the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter. The current implementation does not handle the list case correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve adjusting the logic for determining the `key_type` and handling the `key` parameter based on its type. Additionally, it may need to ensure that the correct exception is raised when the key does not exist in the index.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have revised the logic for handling list-like keys by including a check for `is_list_like(key)` and updating the `key_type` determination and handling based on the type of key. Additionally, I have included the specific key types identified in the failing test cases to ensure consistent behavior.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, including list-like keys, as observed in the failing test cases.
