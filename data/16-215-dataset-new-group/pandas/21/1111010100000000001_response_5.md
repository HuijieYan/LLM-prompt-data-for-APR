The function `_get_with` is designed to extract data from the Series based on the provided key. The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditions and returns. 

The cause of the bug is that when the key is a list or ndarray, the function attempts to process it as a single element key. However, when the key is a list or ndarray, it should be processed as a sequence of keys.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions and returns in the function to properly handle different types of keys.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've added an additional condition to check if the key is a single scalar value and is not list-like. If so, it uses the `loc` method to extract the data. If the key is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, it directly uses the `loc` method to extract the data for the sequence of keys. Otherwise, it falls back to reindexing the key.
