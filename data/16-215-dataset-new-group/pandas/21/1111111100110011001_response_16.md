Since there's no direct indication of the location of the bug, it seems that the issue lies within the conditions that check the type of the `key` variable and its subsequent handling. The error message indicates a KeyError when checking for `key` in `ser`, so the bug may be related to how the 'key' is being interpreted or processed.

The bug in the `_get_with` function may be caused by incorrect handling of the `key` variable and its type. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` and is failing to handle it appropriately.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to explicitly check the type of the `key` variable and ensure that it is properly handled in the subsequent conditions.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer 
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is obtained using `lib.infer_dtype` and is explicitly checked to determine how to handle the `key` variable. This should ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the type of the `key` and returns the expected results for each case.
