To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to update the handling of array-like indexers, particularly for the case of a list indexer. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the behavior of the `ser[list(key)]` case is inconsistent with other array-like indexers, causing a `KeyError`.

Based on the information provided, the following approach can be used to fix the bug:
- Update the logic to handle list indexers in a similar way as other array-like indexers, such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.
- Ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of array-like indexers, eliminating the `KeyError` for the `ser[key]` case.

Now, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the changes include:
- Adding `ensure_index(key)` to handle list indexers and ensure consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.
- Replacing `isinstance(key, Index)` with `key.inferred_type` to check for the inferred type of the key, making the logic more robust.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and produce consistent behavior for different types of array-like indexers, satisfying the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
