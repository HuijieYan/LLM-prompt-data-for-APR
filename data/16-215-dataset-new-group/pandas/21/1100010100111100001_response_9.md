Based on the error messages and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue arises when trying to access the series using a key that does not exist in the series.

The possible bug in the provided function is that it fails to handle the case where the key is not present in the series. It attempts to check the type of the key and then perform operations based on its type, but it does not handle the scenario where the key is not found in the series.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to verify if the key exists in the series before attempting any operations on it. If the key does not exist, we can raise a KeyError to indicate that the key was not found in the series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if key not in self.index:` before attempting to access the key in the series. If the key is not found, a KeyError is raised with an appropriate message indicating that the key was not found in the index. This should address the issue and ensure that the function properly handles cases where the key is not present in the series.
