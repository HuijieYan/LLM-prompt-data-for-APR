The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be that the key_type is not correctly determined. The function has implementations to handle slice, DataFrame, tuple, and list inputs. It then tries to determine the key_type based on the type of the key input. However, it fails to correctly determine the key_type, leading to wrong returns based on this incorrect determination.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the key_type determination logic to accurately ascertain the type of the key input. This may involve refining conditions for different key types and ensuring that the correct type is assigned to `key_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we added a check for scalars using the `is_scalar` function. If the key is a scalar, it directly returns `self.loc[key]`. This ensures that scalars are handled correctly. Then on line 16-24, we re-implemented the key_type determination and index handling for the list type. This guarantees the correct handling of `list` inputs.
By making these changes, the function should now provide the expected outputs for the given input cases, as described in the expected values section.

The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values.
