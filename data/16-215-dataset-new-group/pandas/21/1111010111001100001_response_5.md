The bug appears to be in the determination of the `key_type` due to incorrect conditions in the `_get_with` function. The function seems to incorrectly identify the `key_type` as a string when it should be inferred based on the input key.

To fix the bug, the conditions for determining the `key_type` need to be updated to correctly infer the type based on the input key. Additionally, the conditions for handling different types of keys and indices should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key) and all(is_bool(sub_key) for sub_key in key):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional conditions to handle boolean keys and lists of boolean keys properly, and also raises a `KeyError` with the correct message in case of no matches found.
