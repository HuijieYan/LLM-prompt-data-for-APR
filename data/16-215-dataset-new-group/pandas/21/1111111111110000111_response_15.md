To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue where the `list(key)` indexer is treated differently from other array-like indexers. The failing test is trying to retrieve a value from the Series using a list indexer, but it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` as it does with other array-like indexers.

The function should handle all array-like indexers consistently and return `NaN` for unmatched keys, or raise a `KeyError` if no matching index is found.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # return NaN for unmatched keys
        return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.NaN)
    
    return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.NaN)
```

In the corrected version, we handle all array-like indexers consistently by calling `reindex` and providing `fill_value=np.NaN` to return `NaN` for unmatched keys. This change ensures that the function handles array-like indexers including lists in the same way, providing consistent behavior in returning `NaN` for unmatched keys and avoiding `KeyError` for unmatched keys.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior in indexers.
