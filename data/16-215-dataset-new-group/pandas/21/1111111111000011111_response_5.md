The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency when using a list indexer, which raises a `KeyError`, compared to other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, the bug occurs when using a list indexer, which is not being handled correctly and raises a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers, and handle them correctly within the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure that key is an Index
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the `key` is converted to an Index, which provides consistent handling for all types of indexers, including lists.

This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers.
