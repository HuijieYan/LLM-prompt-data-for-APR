## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The logic to determine the type of the key is not clear and may have behavior that does not align with the expected functionality.
2. The handling of different types of key inputs, such as lists, Index, numpy arrays, and scalars, might not be consistent.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by inconsistent behavior in handling different types of key inputs. The function is not determining the type of the key correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list. This inconsistency has been highlighted by the GitHub issue.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to have consistent handling of different types of key inputs such as lists, Index, numpy arrays, and scalars. Additionally, the logic to determine the type of the key should be revisited to ensure it aligns with the expected functionality.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if is_scalar(key):
            if key not in self.index:
                raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = ensure_index(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the function consistently checks for scalar inputs, ensures index types, and uses the appropriate indexing method based on the type of key. Additionally, it includes error handling to raise a KeyError if the key is not found in the index. This addresses the inconsistency and aligns with the expected functionality.
