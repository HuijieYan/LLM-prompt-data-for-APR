To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers. The key issue is that when using a list indexer, the function is not handling it in the same way as other types of indexers.

The bug occurs because the function is not treating list indexers the same way as the other types of indexers. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when using list key types, as shown in the GitHub issue. The function does not handle the list key type correctly, which leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers. To achieve this, we can modify the code to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with the other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys consistently with other indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle list-like keys consistently with other indexers by using `self.loc[key]` for list-like keys. This ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
