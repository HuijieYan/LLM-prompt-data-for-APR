The bug occurs within the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The function seems to be attempting to use the key as a positional index with the `.iloc[]` method, but the key is of type `Series` which is the incorrect approach resulting in a `KeyError`. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is handled correctly based on its type. If it's a single value or a list, it should be used as a label (using `.loc[]`), otherwise, it should be treated as positional and used with the `.iloc[]` method. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):  # Single label or scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):  # List or array
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version of the function checks the type of the `key` and uses `.loc[]` if it's a single label or scalar, `.iloc[]` for a list or array, and `reindex` for other types. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test scenarios.
