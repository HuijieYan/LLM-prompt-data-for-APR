Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs when the function encounters the case where the key is not present in the index. The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers.

The bug may be caused by the function's inability to handle the case where the key is not found in the index, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy could be to modify the function to handle the case where the key is not found in the index by implementing a conditional check to ensure that the key exists in the index before attempting to retrieve the values. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure consistency in the behavior of different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function based on the suggested strategy:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if self.index.isin(key).any():
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return np.nan
```
In the corrected version, a conditional check `if self.index.isin(key).any()` is added to verify if the key exists in the index before attempting to retrieve the values. If the key is not found in the index, the function returns `np.nan` to handle the case where the key is not present.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers.
