The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the inconsistent treatment of list indexers and array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors when accessing elements through the `__getitem__` function, causing unexpected errors.

In all the provided runtime cases, the `key_type` variable is determined as `'string'` when it should be either `'integer'` or `'bool'`. This indicates that the logic for inferring the type of the key is not working as expected and is leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the logic for inferring the type of the key needs to be modified to ensure that it accurately identifies whether the key is of type `'integer'`, `'bool'`, or something else. Additionally, the behavior for list-like indexers and array-like indexers needs to be made consistent to avoid unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is first checked for being a scalar. If it is a scalar, it is accessed using `self.loc[key]`. If it is an array-like indexer, the function `_get_values_tuple` is called, ensuring consistent behavior for list-like and array-like indexers.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
