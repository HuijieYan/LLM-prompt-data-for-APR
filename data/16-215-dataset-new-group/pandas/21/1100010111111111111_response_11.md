The issue here is that the function `_get_with` contains a conditional check for the type of the key, but it does not handle the case where the key is a list. This results in inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional checks to handle the case where the key is a list. We can modify the function to treat the list case the same as the other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the key is not list-like, and if it is not, we use the `loc` indexer. Otherwise, we handle the key as an array-like indexer and proceed accordingly.

By making these modifications, we ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, including lists.

This corrected version should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
