The bug seems to be related to the way that the function `_get_with` handles the input parameter `key`. The function attempts to categorize the type of `key` and perform different operations based on its type, but the categorization logic seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

In cases 1, 2, and 3, the variable `key_type` is always assigned the value `'string'`, indicating that the logic that infers the type of `key` is always returning the same value, regardless of the actual type of `key`. This may be the cause of the bug.

Based on the failing test, the error occurs when `ser[key]` is called. This indicates that the behavior of `_get_with` when `key` is a `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` is not as expected.

To fix the bug, I suggest revisiting the logic that attempts to determine the type of `key` and ensure that it accurately identifies the type. Additionally, the conditional checks for different types of `key` should be thoroughly tested to ensure they are behaving as expected.

Here's a possible fix for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version simplifies the categorization of `key` and uses the `is_scalar` function to handle non-iterable, scalar keys. It then directly falls back to `loc` indexing for other types of keys.

Ensure to run the failing test once the modified function is implemented to check if the fix is effective.
