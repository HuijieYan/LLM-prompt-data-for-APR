## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers and return the appropriate result based on the type of indexer. The failing test indicates that the specific case of using a list as an indexer is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when it should not.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The condition checks for a non-list-like key and then uses `self.loc[key]` which may not be the correct behavior for list-like keys.
2. The block handling the case where `key` is not a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index seems to convert the key to a list without considering the context in which it is being used.
3. The conditional checks for key types such as boolean and integer, but does not explicitly handle the case of a list.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug can be attributed to the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a list is used as an indexer, it causes a `KeyError` to be raised when it shouldn't, as indicated by the failing test. The GitHub issue also points out this inconsistency and provides examples of the different behavior for list-like indexers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is aligned with the expectations for non-list indexers. This may involve approaching the indexing operation differently for list-like keys.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes an additional check for list-like keys and appropriately handles them by using `self.loc[key]` for this specific case. This ensures consistent behavior for list-like key indexers and resolves the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
