The `lib.infer_dtype` function is used to infer the key type, but it is not able to handle an empty key, which leads to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `key` is empty, in the `_get_with` function. If `key` is empty, then the function should return a new series without any index. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not key:
        return self._constructor()
    
    # other code remains the same
```

This corrected code should be able to pass the failing test.
