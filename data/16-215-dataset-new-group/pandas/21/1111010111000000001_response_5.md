The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing an error when a key that does not match any of the index values is used. The bug is related to the handling of the `key` parameter, especially when it's a scalar or other non-standard index type.

The bug occurs when the key is not found in the index, and it raises a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the index values match. This behavior is incorrect and inconsistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the key is handled properly, and any potential mismatches with the index values are resolved without raising an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
1. We check if the `key` is list-like. If it's not, we convert it into a list.
2. We then use the indexed selection of pandas (`self.loc[key]`) to retrieve the values based on the key.

This corrected function should allow the test case provided to pass without raising a `KeyError`.
