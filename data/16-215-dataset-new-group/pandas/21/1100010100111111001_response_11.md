The bug in the function `_get_with` occurs because the variable `key_type` is being set to the value `'integer'`, which leads to the incorrect case being executed later in the function. This is causing the tests to fail. 

To fix this bug, the logic that determines the `key_type` needs to be revised so that it correctly identifies the type of the input key.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCMultiIndex, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCPeriodIndex, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, np.ndarray)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing tests should be resolved and the expected input/output values will be satisfied.
