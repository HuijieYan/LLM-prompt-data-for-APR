The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled, especially when there are no matches found in the index. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, or pandas Index objects.

The main issue arises from the inconsistent handling of indexers when no matches are found in the index. The function is not correctly handling the case when a list indexer is provided and no matches are found in the index, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers when no matches are found in the index. The corrected version should handle this case consistently without raising a KeyError and should align with the expected behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Reindex with the provided key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers and handles the case where no matches are found in the index without raising a KeyError.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
