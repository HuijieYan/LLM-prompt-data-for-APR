## The bug's cause and explanation
The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. When using a list indexer, the function raises a KeyError, while it returns NaN for other array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in unexpected behavior and does not align with the expected behavior of the function.

The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the behavior of the function to be consistent across different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series), but the function currently fails to provide consistent behavior for list indexers.

The `_get_with` function should treat all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently and handle them in a uniform manner. The inconsistency arises due to the different error handling and output of the function for different types of indexers, which results in failing tests and unexpected behavior.

## The strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to treat all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) uniformly. This involves handling the different types of indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the function returns the expected output and does not raise unexpected errors. By addressing the inconsistency in handling different indexers, the function's behavior will align with the expected behavior, and the failing tests will pass.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers is unified, ensuring consistent behavior across list, ndarray, Index, and Series. This should address the inconsistency and ensure that the function passes the failing tests and aligns with the expected behavior.
