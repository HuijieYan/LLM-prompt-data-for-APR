The issue seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles indexers of different types, specifically when using a list indexer.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue is with the handling of list indexers. The GitHub issue also points out the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. This causes a KeyError to be raised when attempting to access non-matching items using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have made the function `_get_with` handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

This should fix the bug, and the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
