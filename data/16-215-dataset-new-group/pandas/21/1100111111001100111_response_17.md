The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list indexers. The issue is that when using `ser[key]` or `ser[np.array(key)]`, it returns NaN, but when using `ser[list(key)]`, it raises a KeyError.

The problem arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently, avoiding the KeyError raised when using `ser[list(key)]`.

This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
