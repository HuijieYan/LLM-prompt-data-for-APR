The buggy function is not correctly handling the different types of input keys, hence causing the `KeyError` in the failing test. The function is meant to have conditional logic to handle different input types such as lists, arrays, and indices, but it is not handling these cases correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and is not handling the different types of keys appropriately. This leads to incorrect indexing operations and eventually results in a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent key in the series.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle different key types correctly, and ensure that the function is treating lists, arrays, and indices in a way that aligns with how a Series should be indexed using these different types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series indexing"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different input key types correctly and ensures that the corresponding indexing operations are performed in a way that aligns with the expected behavior of a Series.
