The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class. It checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to the inconsistency in behavior.

The failing test is designed to check the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when the key doesn't match any index values. The error message indicates that the `None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]`.

The GitHub issue also describes this inconsistency, highlighting that the behavior of list indexers is different from array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in the case of `ser[list(key)]` while the other cases handle it differently.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a way that is consistent with the behavior of array-like indexers. Based on the GitHub issue, the list indexers should be treated like the other indexers and not raise a KeyError when the key does not match any index values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are treated consistently with other indexers, avoiding the KeyError when the key does not match any index values. This fix should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and make the function behavior more predictable and consistent across different types of indexers.
