The issue stems from the `_get_with` function, which treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This issue is leading to inconsistent behavior in the `ser[key]` operation, causing a `KeyError` to be raised for a list indexer while array-like indexers don't raise the error.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for different indexer types, such as `if isinstance(key, list)`, and the subsequent handling of these indexers can lead to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can review the conditional checks for different indexer types and ensure that the handling of these indexers is consistent across the board. This will involve ensuring that the handling for list, numpy array, DataFrame, and Index types is uniform to avoid any inconsistencies.

Based on the analysis, here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all types of indexers uniformly
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the conditional handling of different indexers is streamlined and consistent, ensuring that the `KeyError` is not raised inconsistently for list indexers. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well as resolve the failing test cases provided.
