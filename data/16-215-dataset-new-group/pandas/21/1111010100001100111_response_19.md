## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition for `ABCDataFrame` is not handled correctly.
2. The check for `is_list_like` and `Index` may not be functioning as expected.
3. The handling of `Index` type may have issues.
4. The inference of `key_type` may not be accurate.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers in the `Series` class. Specifically, the handling of a list indexer is different from other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently. Specifically, the handling of `ABCDataFrame`, `is_list_like`, `Index` type, and the inference of `key_type` needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure consistent behavior and proper indexing.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "floating"):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Changed `ABCDataFrame` to `pd.DataFrame` for consistency.
2. Updated the conditions for `is_list_like` and `Index` to ensure proper handling.
3. Adjusted the logic for `key_type` inference to consider additional types such as `"string"` and `"floating"`.
4. Refined the return logic based on the inferred `key_type` to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
