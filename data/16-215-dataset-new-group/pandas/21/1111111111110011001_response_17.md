The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError to be raised when the function is called with certain parameters. After analyzing the function and the failing tests, the bug seems to be related to the `key` variable being passed to the function. The function is supposed to handle different types of input for the `key` parameter, but it is failing to do so for some cases.

The bug is likely to be related to the conditional statements in the function, specifically the checks for the type of `key` and the assignment of `key_type` based on the type of `key`. There might be an incorrect mapping between the type of `key` and the corresponding actions within the function.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling different types of `key` should be reviewed and adjusted to correctly identify and process the input. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of `key` in some cases, leading to the KeyError being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been modified to handle different types of `key` appropriately, and the TypeError is raised for DataFrame and Index inputs.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
