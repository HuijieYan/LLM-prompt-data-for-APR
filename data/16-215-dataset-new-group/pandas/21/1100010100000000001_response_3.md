The buggy function provided is supposed to handle different types of indexing for a pandas Series object. However, there are several potential error locations within the function. 

1. The first potential error is with the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`. This condition is incorrect because it checks if the key is an instance of a DataFrame, but it should be checking for a scalar or a different type of index that is not supported.

2. The second potential error is with the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))`. This condition is checking for the types of the key, but the operation inside is incorrect as it converts the key to a list, even if it is already an instance of Index.

3. The third potential error is with the condition `if isinstance(key, Index):`. This condition is checking the type of the key rather than the values it contains, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

4. The fourth potential error is with the condition `if key_type == "integer":`. This condition is checking whether the key is of type "integer" and deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing, but it does not cover all cases and may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bugs in the function, the following approach can be taken:
1. Remove the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` and replace it with a condition that checks for a scalar or a different type of index that is not supported.
2. Modify the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` to handle different types of keys correctly without converting them unnecessarily.
3. Change the condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` to check the values of the key instead of the type.
4. Revise the condition `if key_type == "integer":` to cover all cases of integer indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Invalid key type. Use the appropriate key type for indexing"
        )

    else:
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_list_like(key):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid key type. Use the appropriate key type for indexing")
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- The conditions have been restructured to handle different types of keys and to perform the correct operation for each type.
- The unnecessary type conversion has been removed, and the key type is inferred correctly based on the key values.
- An else block has been added to handle the case where the key type is not recognized, and a ValueError is raised to indicate an invalid key type.
