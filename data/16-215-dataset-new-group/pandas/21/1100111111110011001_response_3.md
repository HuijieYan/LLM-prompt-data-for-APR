The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles the `key` parameter and determines the `key_type`. The function is designed to handle different types of keys and return different values accordingly. However, the bug causes it to fail in identifying the correct type of the `key`, leading to errors such as `KeyError`.

The bug appears to be caused by incorrect handling of the `key` parameter and the failure to properly determine its type, leading to the wrong path being taken in the function's logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is properly handled and its type is correctly determined. We should also review the logic in determining `key_type` and make necessary adjustments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key` parameter is converted to an Index using the `ensure_index` function. This helps in properly handling different types of keys and ensuring that the `key_type` is correctly determined. Additionally, we have also made sure to handle the case where the key is an integer type in a way that avoids the KeyError issue.
