The issue with the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is that it is not properly handling key types such as list, np.ndarray, or pd.Index. The bug causes a failing test with a `KeyError`.

The bug is due to the mishandling of non-integer key types like list, np.ndarray, or pd.Index, and also the incorrect use of `loc` and `iloc` methods. The current implementation does not correctly handle these key types, leading to the raised `KeyError` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_get_with` function to properly handle non-integer key types and ensure that the correct indexing method (`.loc` or `.iloc`) is used based on the key type. Additionally, we should handle the case when the key is not found in the index by providing a custom error message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {[(repr(k)) for k in key]} are in the index")
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should handle different key types correctly and return the expected results without raising a `KeyError`.
