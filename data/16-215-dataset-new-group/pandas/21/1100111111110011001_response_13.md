The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional statement that handles the type of the `key` parameter. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect assignment of `key` when it is not a list-like object. The code does not correctly handle the case when `key` is not list-like and it is a scalar. 

A strategy for fixing the bug involves properly distinguishing between the cases when `key` is a scalar or not a list-like object. The code should ensure that `key` is properly handled in these cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    key_type = None
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
      
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case when key is not a list-like object
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle the non-list-like case by using the `is_scalar` method to check if `key` is a scalar. This ensures that scalars are handled separately and that the correct behavior is maintained for non-list-like objects. Then, the function continues to handle other cases and returns the expected outputs based on the type of `key`.
