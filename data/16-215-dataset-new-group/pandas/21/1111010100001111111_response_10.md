To fix the bug in the _get_with function, we need to address the error in handling list indexers differently from array-like indexers. We also need to ensure that the indexers are handled consistently to avoid unexpected KeyError or TypeError.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to unify the handling of indexers by checking for array-like indexers first, and then handling list indexers separately. This can help avoid inconsistencies in behavior and ensure that the function returns the expected values for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check for array-like indexers using isinstance with tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, and Index. If the key is array-like, we call the _get_values_tuple method to handle the indexing. Next, we handle list indexers separately by checking if the key is an instance of a list, and then returning the result of self.loc[key]. Finally, if the key doesn't match any of these conditions, we fall back to reindexing the key to ensure consistent behavior.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to inconsistent handling of indexers.
