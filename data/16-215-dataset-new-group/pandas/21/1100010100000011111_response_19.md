The buggy function `_get_with` has issues with handling different types of indexers. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as a string and not based on the type of the indexer. This causes the function to return incorrect results or raise errors. To fix the bug, the key_type should be accurately inferred based on the type of the indexer.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to incorrect inference of key_type, which leads to inconsistent behavior when handling different types of indexers, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately infer the key_type based on the type of the indexer, and handle the indexers accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            key_type = type(key).__name__

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added an additional check to infer the key_type based on the type of the indexer. This ensures that the function handles different types of indexers correctly and returns the expected results based on the input parameters and index types.
