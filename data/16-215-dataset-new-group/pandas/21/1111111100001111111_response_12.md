The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior. The issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue provided.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not treating list indexers in a manner consistent with other types of indexers. The disparity in treatment between list indexers and other types is causing inconsistent behavior, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in a manner consistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, which should address the issue and provide the expected behavior:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Convert the key to a list if it's not already one
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently with other types
    if len(key) > 0:
        # Check if any of the elements are in the index
        if all(item in self.index for item in key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # If none of the elements are in the index, raise a KeyError
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, checking if any of the elements are in the index and raising a `KeyError` if none are found.

This should address the inconsistency and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
