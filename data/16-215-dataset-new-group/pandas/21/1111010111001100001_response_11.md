The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of inputs and return the corresponding values. However, there seems to be an issue with the `key_type` variable, as it is always set to `'string'`. This indicates that the inference of the `key_type` is not being executed properly.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect inference of the `key_type`. This inference determines whether to treat the key as a positional indexer (`self.iloc`) or label-based indexer (`self.loc`). Since the `key_type` is always inferred as `'string'`, the conditional blocks based on different types of keys (integer, list, etc.) may not be executed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the way the `key_type` is inferred by directly checking the type of the key and adjusting the conditional logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        # Direct type checks for different key types
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Adjust conditional logic based on the key_type inference
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if key_type == "list":
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly checking the type of the key and inferring the `key_type` accordingly, we address the issue of incorrect type inference. This correction should allow the conditional logic to execute as intended and resolve the bug.
