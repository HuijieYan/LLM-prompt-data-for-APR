Since the failing test is related to the behavior of list indexers in the `ser[key]` operation, we can see that the issue is related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers. The specific scenarios where list indexers are treated differently are:

1. `ser[pd.Index(key)]`
2. `ser[np.array(key)]`
3. `ser[list(key)]`

The GitHub issue also confirms this behavior and points out that list indexers behave differently and raise a KeyError, while the other types of indexers don't raise a KeyError.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we see that the `key_type` is inferred as `'string'` in all cases. This seems incorrect, as the issue is related to list indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with the behavior of other indexers (pd.Index and np.array). We should also ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # Check if the list is empty
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key[0], skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers by inferring the `key_type` based on the first element of the list. Additionally, if the list is empty, we raise a KeyError to handle the case of no matches.

With this corrected version, the given failing tests should pass, and the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved.
