The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the code is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. When using a list as an indexer, the function raises a `KeyError`, while other indexers do not. This inconsistency is causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the code should handle list indexers in the same way it handles other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the function will now handle list indexers in the same way it handles other array-like indexers, which should resolve the issue and make the failing test cases pass.
