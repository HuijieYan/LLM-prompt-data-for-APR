The buggy function `_get_with` contains multiple conditional statements to handle different types of input `key`. However, it seems to incorrectly identify the type of `key` in the given cases. This leads to the wrong execution path being taken, resulting in the failure of the test.

It is evident from the runtime input values and types that the function incorrectly identifies the type of the `key` input parameter. This leads to the incorrect initialization of the `key_type` variable, which in turn leads to the incorrect return path being taken.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should correctly identify the type of the `key` input. It should handle different types of input keys appropriately and return the expected output.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the input `key` is properly handled based on its type, and conditional statements are adjusted accordingly to ensure the correct outcomes for each case presented. The checks for different types of keys are correctly performed, and errors are raised when the key does not match the expected types.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the tests pass successfully.
