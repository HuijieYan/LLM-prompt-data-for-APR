The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function is not checking for the presence of the key in the index before attempting to use it. This leads to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to verify if the key is present in the index before trying to use it. If the key is not found in the index, we should raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check if the key is not in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding the check for the presence of the key in the index, we ensure that a KeyError is not raised when the key is not found.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing tests.
