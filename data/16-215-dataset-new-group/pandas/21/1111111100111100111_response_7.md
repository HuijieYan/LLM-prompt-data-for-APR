The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the different treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. When passing a list as the key to the `ser[key]` operation, it raises a `KeyError` with a message stating that none of the elements are in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled, such as `pd.Index(key)` and `np.array(key)`. The issue on GitHub suggests that this behavior is not consistent and questions whether there is a compelling reason for it.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should treat list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, instead of raising a `KeyError`. This consistency will align the behavior of the function with user expectations and reduce confusion.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass without raising a `KeyError`. The function now treats list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, resulting in consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
