The bug is caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights this inconsistency, specifically in how different indexers are handled, leading to unexpected behavior and KeyErrors.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that all indexers are treated consistently and that the behavior for list indexers aligns with the behavior for other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Align the behavior for list indexers with other indexers
        if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "mixed-integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
``` 

By aligning the behavior for list indexers with other indexers and handling integer and mixed-integer types separately, we ensure a consistent and correct treatment of different indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
