The bug in the `_get_with` function can be identified as the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in different behaviors and error messages when indexing a `Series` using a list.

Based on the GitHub issue, it is evident that the behavior of `ser[list(key)]` is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers, resulting in a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers. This can be achieved by handling the different types of indexers appropriately and ensuring that the logic for indexing using a list is consistent with other array-like indexers.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or slice is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate Series method"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, all indexers, including list indexers, are treated consistently. The function first tries to index the `Series` using `loc`, and if a `KeyError` or `IndexError` is encountered, it falls back to reindexing the `Series` with the key.

This approach ensures that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
