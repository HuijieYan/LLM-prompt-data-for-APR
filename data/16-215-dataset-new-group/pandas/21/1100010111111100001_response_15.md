The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by incorrect type checking and handling of the `key` parameter. We can see that the function has various checks for different types of inputs, but the checks might not cover all possible cases, especially when the input is a list, ndarray, or Index.

The failing test indicates that the function should be able to handle input parameters like list, ndarray, Index, or Series. However, based on the identified potential error locations within the function, the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which seems to be the source of the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the type checking and handling logic of the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame,)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes made include:
1. Updated the check for `pd.DataFrame` (imported as `pd`) to ensure correct type checking.
2. Added a check for scalar values using `is_scalar` to handle non-list-like scalars.
3. Updated the type checking logic and removed redundant checks.

The corrected function should now be able to handle the different types of input parameters as per the failing test cases.
