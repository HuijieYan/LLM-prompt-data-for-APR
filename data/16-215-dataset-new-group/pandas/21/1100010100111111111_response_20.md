The buggy function `_get_with` is mistakenly treating the list indexers differently from other indexers, including array-like indexers. This leads to inconsistencies and incorrect behavior when accessing the Series with different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the data using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are treated consistently and that the function can handle list indexers properly without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, it should handle all types of indexers consistently and avoid the KeyError issue with list indexers. This will address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function passes the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
