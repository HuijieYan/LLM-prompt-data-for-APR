The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects. The function is not handling the case of using a list indexer correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to index with a list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the list-like key. When the key is a list, the function should apply the same logic as it does for other indexers, such as arrays or Index objects, to avoid the KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to properly handle list-like keys. It should use the same logic as it does for arrays and Index objects to handle the list key without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function checks for list-like keys in the same clause as arrays, Index objects, and other indexers, and then uses `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing. This will ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers and should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
