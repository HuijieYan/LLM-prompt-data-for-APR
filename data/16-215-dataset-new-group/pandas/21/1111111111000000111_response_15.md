## Identified error locations and potential issues in the buggy function:

1. The function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers consistently, as noted in the GitHub issue. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a KeyError when accessed with a list indexer.
2. The if-else conditions within the function are not properly handling different types of indexers, leading to the inconsistency in behavior.

## Cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug lies in the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when attempting to access the function with a list indexer.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that list indexers behave in the same way as other array-like indexers.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function `_get_with` has been modified to handle Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, and Series consistently. It now checks for different types of indexers and handles them appropriately to ensure consistent behavior, addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
