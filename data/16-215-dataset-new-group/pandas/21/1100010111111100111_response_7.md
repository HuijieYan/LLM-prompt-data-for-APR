The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the input key type properly, especially when it is a list or array-like indexer. This is causing inconsistency in behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs in the function when the key is a list or array-like object, and it tries to handle it with different logic based on its type. This leads to inconsistent behavior and raises errors in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list and array-like indexers consistently and does not raise errors for valid operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list and array-like indexers are consistently handled and do not lead to errors for valid operations. The logic for handling different types of indexers has been modified to remove inconsistencies and ensure proper functionality.
