The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of input keys and return the appropriate result. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could cause it to fail, such as the logic for handling different key types and index types.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is using a Series key to index another Series, which should raise a KeyError since the key values are not in the index of the original Series.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the key is a Series. Additionally, we should review and simplify the logic for handling different key types and index types to ensure correctness and clarity.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        if key.isin(self.index).all():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version checks if the key is a Series, then uses the `isin` method to verify if all the values in the key are present in the index of the original Series. If all values are present, it returns the result of the `loc` operation on the original Series with the key. Otherwise, it raises a KeyError with a specific message indicating that none of the key values are in the index.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.
