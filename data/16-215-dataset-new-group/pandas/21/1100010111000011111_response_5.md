The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where a list indexer is passed as the key. This is causing inconsistent behavior with other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block, it simply returns `self.loc[key]`. However, when a list-like object is passed as the key, the call to `self.loc[key]` is actually raising a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case when a list indexer is passed. We can also ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function should now handle the case when a list indexer is passed as the key and ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers. The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
