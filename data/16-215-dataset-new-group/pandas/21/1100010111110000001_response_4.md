The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue in the section of code that checks the type of the `key` parameter. It attempts to perform a series of checks and convert the input into a specific format, but it fails to handle all cases properly. The failing test cases indicate that the key parameter might be getting converted into data types such as list, numpy array, index, or series, and the function fails to handle these cases properly.

A potential fix for the bug in the function `_get_with` is to handle all the types of input properly so that the subsequent operations can be carried out without raising errors.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function has additional condition checks to handle the different types of inputs such as list, numpy array, extension array, series, and index. After applying these checks, the function should handle diverse input types more effectively and reduce the chances of raising errors.
