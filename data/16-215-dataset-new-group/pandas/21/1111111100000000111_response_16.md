The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that the handling of list indexers is different from array-like indexers, which results in inconsistent behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with the handling of array-like indexers and to address the specific case where `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the handling of list indexers is consistent with the handling of array-like indexers, and it addresses the specific case where `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError.
