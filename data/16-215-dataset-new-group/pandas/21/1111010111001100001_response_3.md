The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be caused by the incorrect type of the `key_type` variable.

From the provided runtime values and types of the variables, it can be observed that the `key_type` is always being assigned a string value, which is incorrect. This is likely causing the function to not handle the keys properly and resulting in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the key type needs to be accurately determined. It seems that the key type is being incorrectly inferred as a string in all cases, which is leading to the incorrect behavior.

The bug can be fixed by accurately determining the key type based on the input key. In the cases provided, the key is actually an array-like object, so the key type should be inferred accordingly. The correct key type should be based on the type of key passed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Update to correctly handle the key type
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `lib.infer_dtype` and updating the logic to handle the key type correctly, the corrected version of the function should now be able to accurately determine the key type and handle the input key accordingly. This should ensure that the failing tests now pass.
