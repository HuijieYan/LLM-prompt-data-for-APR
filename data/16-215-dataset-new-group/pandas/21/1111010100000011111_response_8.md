The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there is a bug related to how it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue titled `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]`. The issue details how list indexers behave inconsistently compared to other indexers and raises a KeyError in certain cases, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling list indexers needs to be adjusted to ensure consistency with other array-like indexers and to prevent the KeyError from being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the case when key is not list-like
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of list indexers has been modified to ensure consistency with other array-like indexers. The conditional checks have been restructured to properly identify the type of indexers and make appropriate method calls. This should resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue and prevent the KeyError from being raised in the specific case mentioned.
