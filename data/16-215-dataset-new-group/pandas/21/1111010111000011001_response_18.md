The buggy function has a few potential error locations:
1. The function does not handle the case where key is a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index properly. It tries to handle it as a scalar instead of an iterable.
2. The function does not properly infer the type of the key and instead always sets key_type to 'integer' or 'string', leading to incorrect behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the different types of input keys, leading to incorrect inference of the key type.

To fix the bug, we should properly handle the case when key is an iterable, such as a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. We should also correctly infer the key type based on the input key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, slice):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the case when key is a slice, then handle the case when key is an ABCDataFrame, tuple, or scalar. We then properly handle the case when key is an iterable by converting it to a list if it's not already one. Finally, we correctly infer the key type based on the input key.
