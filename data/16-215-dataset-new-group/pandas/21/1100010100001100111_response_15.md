The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to handling different types of indexers and the inconsistency in behavior when using a list as an indexer.

The issue is specifically related to how the function handles a list indexer, causing inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This may involve updating the logic for different types of indexers and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across the board.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we specifically handle list indexers by converting them to a list if they are list-like. Additionally, we handle the case of using a list as an indexer separately to ensure consistent behavior.

This should address the inconsistency and the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
