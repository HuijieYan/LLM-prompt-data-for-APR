The issue appears to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, particularly the inconsistency in how it treats list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The bug occurs when the function receives a key as input and tries to determine the type of key based on its index. This determination is inconsistent for different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially raising errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of indexers and that the determination of the key type is consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        # Determine whether to treat this as a positional indexer (i.e. self.iloc) 
        # or label-based (i.e. self.loc) and handle list indexing case GH#4246
        if (is_list_like(key) and not all(self.index.isin(key))) or isinstance(key, list):
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional to check for mixed-integer type indexers, an additional check for list indexers, and handle the indexing appropriately based on the determined key type. This should address the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.
