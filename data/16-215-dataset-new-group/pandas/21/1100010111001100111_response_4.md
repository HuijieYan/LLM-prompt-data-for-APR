The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing an inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers. When using a list as an indexer, the function is not properly handling the case where there are no matches, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where there are no matches for the index. This can be seen in the failing test, where a list indexer is used and it raises a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where there are no matches for the index when using a list-like indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError as e:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError as e:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e
```

In the corrected function, we handle the case where there are no matches for the index when using list-like indexers by catching the `KeyError` and re-raising it with a more informative message.

With this modification, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
