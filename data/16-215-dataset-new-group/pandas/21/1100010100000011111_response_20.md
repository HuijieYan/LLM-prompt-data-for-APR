The buggy function `_get_with` has several potential error locations. One of the main issues is the incorrect handling of different types of indexers and the inconsistent behavior when using a list as an indexer in a Series. This is related to the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches."

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors when using a list as an indexer in a Series.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and not raise errors for list indexers. It should also ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
        
    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, and it ensures that the key_type is correctly inferred for different types of indexers.

This fix should address the inconsistent behavior and errors raised when using list indexers in a Series, as reported in the GitHub issue.
