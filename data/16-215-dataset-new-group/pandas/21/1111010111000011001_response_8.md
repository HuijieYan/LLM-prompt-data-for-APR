The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug that causes it to fail the test. The bug lies in the logic for determining the type of the key and returning the appropriate value based on that type. The incorrect handling of different types of keys is causing the function to fail.

The bug occurs when the function is unable to correctly determine the type of the key, leading to incorrect behavior in returning the desired value. This can be due to incorrect type checking logic or mishandling of certain types of keys.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to have a more comprehensive and accurate type checking logic for the key, and appropriate handling for each type of key to ensure the correct value is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the key type is accurately determined using the `is_scalar` function and appropriate handling for each type of key is implemented to ensure the correct value is returned.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
