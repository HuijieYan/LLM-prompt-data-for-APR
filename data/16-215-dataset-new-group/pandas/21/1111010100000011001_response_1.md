The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the incorrect determination of the `key_type` and the subsequent decision on how to handle indexing based on the `key_type`.

The bug causes the function to return incorrect values or raise errors when trying to index the Series with certain types of keys, such as a DataFrame, tuple, or non-list-like key.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `key_type` is correctly determined and use that information to handle the indexing appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Infer the dtype of the key

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the list indexing case GH#4246
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we removed the unnecessary check for the Index type, as it is handled in the isinstance check for a list. We also removed the distinction between different types of keys and inferred the `key_type` using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. This should provide a more accurate determination of the key type and handle the indexing accordingly.
