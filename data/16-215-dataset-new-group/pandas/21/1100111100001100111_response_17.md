Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug lies in the function's handling of different types of indexers and their corresponding behavior. The issue reported on GitHub highlights inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are treated and provides specific examples where the behavior varies.

The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically addressing the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle non-list indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # consistent handling of different indexer types
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]  # treat array-like and list indexers the same
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles different types of indexers in a consistent manner and ensures that the behavior aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue. This should address the reported inconsistency and resolve the bug in the function.
