The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing unexpected behavior and errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The issue seems to stem from the handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.) within the `_get_with` function. The `_get_with` function needs to be fixed to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with the other types of indexers, and to avoid raising errors when using `ser.loc[key]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other indexers, and that errors are not raised when using `ser.loc[key]`. This should resolve the inconsistency and unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
