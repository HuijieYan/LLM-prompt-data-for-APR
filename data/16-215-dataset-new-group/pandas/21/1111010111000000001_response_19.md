The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug arises from how the key is handled, specifically when `key` is an array-like object such as list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. When the key is passed into the `_get_with` function, the code processes it in an incorrect manner, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access a non-existent index value.

The code fails to handle the mismatch of the `key` with the `index` correctly when `key` is an array-like object.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the code to handle array-like objects properly by checking for the existence of the key in the index and then returning the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if key is an array-like object
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Convert key to a list
        key_list = list(key)
        
        # Check if any key is not in the index
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key_list):
            raise KeyError(f"Some of {key_list} are not in the [index]")
        
        # Return the result
        return self.loc[key_list]

    # If key is not array-like, proceed with the original logic
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
            
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `key` is an array-like object. If it is, we convert it to a list and then compare each key with the index. If any key is not present in the index, we raise a KeyError. Otherwise, we return the result using `loc`. If `key` is not array-like, we proceed with the original logic.

This corrected version handles array-like objects properly, and it should pass the failing test.
