The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect identification of the `key_type`. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` due to issues in the type inference process.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type inference process correctly identifies the datatype of the `key`, especially when it is an array-like type. We also need to handle cases where the key is not found in the index and raise a KeyError accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, tuple)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e
```

This corrected version properly handles the different types of `key`, including array-like types and tuples. It also correctly raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, which aligns with the expected behavior in the failing tests.
