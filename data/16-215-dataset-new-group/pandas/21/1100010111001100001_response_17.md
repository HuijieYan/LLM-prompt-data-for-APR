The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the `key_type` variable is incorrectly assigned the value `'string'` in all cases, which leads to improper handling of the key and results in a KeyError. This happens because the `key_type` is inferred using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, which incorrectly infers the type as a string. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the input `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_integer(key):
            key_type = "integer"
        elif is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        else:
            key_type = "mixed"  # assuming mixed if not one of the recognized types

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to infer the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key`. If the key is an integer, it is assigned the type "integer". If it's a boolean, it's assigned the type "boolean". If it's none of the recognized types, it's assumed to be "mixed". This ensures that the `key_type` is correctly determined and used to handle the key appropriately.
