The bug in the given function `_get_with` is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

The function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values from a Series based on the given key. However, the bug occurs when using a list as the key. The error message indicates that the behavior is inconsistent when using different types of indexers, and the test case fails when trying to use a list as the key for indexing the Series.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the list-based indexer (`key`) correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a check is added for the type of indexer (key) used. If the inferred type of the key is "string", it uses label-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`). This ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
