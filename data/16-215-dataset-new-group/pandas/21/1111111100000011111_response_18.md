The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the pandas library. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency and suggests that all cases should behave like the list case. This is in line with the current behavior of the function, which correctly handles list indexers but may fail with array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all indexers, including array-like indexers, are handled in the same way as list indexers. This will involve modifying the logic for handling different types of indexers and ensuring that the correct types and values are assigned to the `key_type` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "list", "boolean"]:
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we convert the input `key` to an index using `ensure_index(key)` to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. We then check for the inferred type of `key` and handle integer, list, and boolean types using `reindex`, which should cover all array-like indexers. Finally, we fall back to `loc` for other types of indexers.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, resolving the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.
