The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect determination of the key's type, leading to the wrong return value. The function should be updated to correctly identify the type of the key and handle each case accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # This case is caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
            raise TypeError("Boolean indexing is not supported")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key type is determined right after checking if the input is scalar (single value) and handled accordingly. For non-scalar keys, the key type is inferred using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. The appropriate actions are then taken based on the inferred key type.

This should resolve the issues seen in the failing tests by ensuring that the correct paths are taken for different key types, improving the overall operation of the function.
