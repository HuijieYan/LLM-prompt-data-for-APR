The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` and it seems that the bug exists in the logic for handling different types of keys, like slices, dataframes, tuples, and other types of keys. 

The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of the different types of keys, leading to incorrect indexing or reindexing operations.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to revisit the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
   
    return self.reindex(key)

```

The corrected version includes proper handling of different types of keys, using the appropriate methods such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` based on the type of the key.
