The issue seems to be related to how the Series handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer does not match any values in the index. The problem is likely caused by the `_get_with` function not handling list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior with other indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers in a consistent manner and returns the appropriate value or error message when the indexer does not match any values in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # using tolist for consistent handling of all list-like indexers
        key = key.tolist()

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the key is not list-like or if it is a string. If so, we return the result of `self.loc[key]`. For indexers that are list-like (such as arrays, series, or index objects), we convert them to a list using the `tolist()` method to ensure consistent handling across different types of list-like indexers.

This should resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases, passing the failing test and addressing the issue raised in GitHub.
