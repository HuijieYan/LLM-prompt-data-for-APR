The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. 

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexers of different types, such as arrays, indexes, and lists. It appears that when a list indexer is used, the function throws a KeyError while other types of indexers do not result in an error.

The key_type variable is derived from the input 'key' by using lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False). It is expected to have string type, but the function likely handles it incorrectly, leading to the bug.

A strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the function handles different types of indexers consistently, especially for list indexers. It should also properly handle the key_type variable, making sure it is correctly determined and utilized.

The corrected version of the function should account for the different types of indexers and handle them consistently to avoid KeyError. It should also ensure that the key_type variable is correctly determined and used.


```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = list(key)  # Convert key to list for consistent handling
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Determine key type
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:  # Check if key type is either integer or string
            return self.loc[key]  # Treat it as label-based (loc)
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]  # Treat it as positional indexer (iloc)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the 'key' is consistently handled as a list, and the 'key_type' is determined using lib.infer_dtype to handle both integer and string indexers correctly. This should address the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
