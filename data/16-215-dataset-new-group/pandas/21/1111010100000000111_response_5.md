Potential errors locations:
1. Line 36: `return self.loc[key]` - this line could be causing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
2. Line 42: `return self.loc[key]` - this line could also be causing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug seems to be occurring when using a list indexer on the Series object, as stated in the GitHub issue. The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in unexpected behavior and inconsistent handling of missing values.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers.
2. The code should handle the list indexer case the same way it handles array-like indexers to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list indexer the same way as array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle the list indexer in the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior. This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue by providing a consistent approach to handling different types of indexers.
