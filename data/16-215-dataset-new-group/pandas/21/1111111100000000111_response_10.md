## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of indexers, but it has issues with consistency and error handling when dealing with list indexers. The GitHub issue provides a specific example of inconsistent behavior and an error message when using a list indexer.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of list indexers and the error message when there are no matches in the index.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. Inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers (`ser[key]` vs `ser[list(key)]`).
2. Inconsistent behavior with error handling between different types of indexers.

## Cause of the Bug
The inconsistency in behavior and error handling seems to stem from the conditional logic that differentiates the handling of list-like indexers from other types of indexers. The bug likely lies in the conditional checks and the subsequent actions taken based on the type of indexer.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic and the subsequent actions based on the type of indexer need to be revisited. Specifically, the handling of list-like indexers should be made consistent with other types of indexers, and the error message should also be handled consistently across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not "
            "supported, use appropriate indexers."
        )

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the function now consistently handles list-like indexers and provides a coherent way to deal with different types of indexers. It also provides consistent error handling across different types of indexers.
