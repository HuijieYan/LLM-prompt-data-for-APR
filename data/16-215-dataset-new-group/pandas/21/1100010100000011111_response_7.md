The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in the function not handling list indexers correctly, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions in certain cases.

To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, np.array, Index) are handled consistently, and that they behave similar to the list case described in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            pass

    # Handle the case for scalar keys that aren't recognized as list_like
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        pass

    # If no matches are found, return NaN
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use the `try-except` block to handle cases where the key may not be found in the index. We first try `self.loc[key]` for array-like indexers (list, np.ndarray, Index), and if no match is found, we attempt to handle scalar keys that aren't recognized as list-like. If no matches are found, we return NaN by using `self.reindex(key)`. This approach ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
