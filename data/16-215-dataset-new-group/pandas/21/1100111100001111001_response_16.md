The buggy function is supposed to retrieve data based on a given key from a Series object. However, the function is incorrectly determining the type of the key and not handling it properly, leading to errors in the output. 

The key issue seems to lie in the key_type determination and subsequent conditional handling based on the key type. The function incorrectly determines the key type, leading to incorrect conditional branches being taken.

A potentially effective strategy for fixing the bug would be to accurately determine the type of the key and then handle the key based on its type. This would involve correctly identifying whether the key is a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple and treating it accordingly. Additionally, handling different types of keys such as lists, Index objects, and scalar values needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function considering the identified issues:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalars and non-list-like inputs
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle common list-like and array-like index types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # Default case - handle other list-like keys and Index objects
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the slice, DataFrame, and tuple cases as before. Then, we handle scalar and non-list-like inputs separately, and finally, we handle the common list-like and array-like index types such as lists, arrays, and Index objects based on their inferred type. This updated logic should address the identified issues and align with the expected input/output values.
