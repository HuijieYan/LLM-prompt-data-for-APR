The buggy function is failing because it does not handle the case where the key is not found in the index properly. It incorrectly infers the key_type as "string" for all cases and should instead be correctly identifying the type of the key, whether it is an integer, boolean, or the other types that are supported by pandas.

The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of the key type, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and raising an error when the key is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the key and handle the case where the key is not found in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we removed the unnecessary check for the inferred type of the key. Instead, we correctly infer the type of the key using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. This will handle all types of keys including integers, boolean, and string types. Then we proceed with the appropriate indexing based on the inferred type of the key.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
