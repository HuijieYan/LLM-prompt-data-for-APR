The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not correctly handling the case when a key is provided that is not present in the index. The function should raise a `KeyError` when this happens, but it is not doing so. This results in the failing test case where the function does not raise the expected `KeyError` when a key is not present in the index.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_get_with` function to correctly check whether the key is present in the index and raise a `KeyError` if it is not.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if the key is present in the index
    if not all(idx in self.index for idx in ensure_index(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index, and it should pass the failing test.
