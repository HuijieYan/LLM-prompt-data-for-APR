The issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The function is designed to handle different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalar values, arrays, and indexes. However, there is inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, especially when a list indexer is used. This leads to a KeyError when attempting to access the Series with a list indexer, unlike other types of indexers.

To resolve this issue, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers. Specifically, the handling of list indexers needs to be updated to align with the behavior of other types of indexers such as arrays or indexes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Reindex with the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and preventing the KeyError from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all cases.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and result in consistent behavior when accessing a Series with different types of indexers, resolving the KeyError that was observed in the failing test cases.
