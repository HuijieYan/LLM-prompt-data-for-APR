The issue arises from inconsistent behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list, an array-like indexers (e.g., pd.Index, pd.Series), or a scalar.

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, where different types of indexers are processed differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of indexers consistently, leading to the passing of the failing test and resolution of the GitHub issue.
