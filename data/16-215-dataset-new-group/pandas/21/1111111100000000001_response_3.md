The bug in the given function is due to the incorrect condition check and the incorrect usage of methods in the Series class from the pandas library. The root cause of the issue is that the function is using incorrect conditions and methods to handle different types of keys.

The `is_list_like()` check is redundant and incorrect when working with different types of keys. The function should handle each type of key separately.

To fix this bug, the following steps can be performed:
1. Remove the redundant `is_list_like()` check.
2. Handle the different types of keys separately, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, and index using appropriate methods from the Series class in the pandas library.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, redundant checks have been removed, and different types of keys are handled separately using appropriate methods provided by the Series class in the pandas library.
