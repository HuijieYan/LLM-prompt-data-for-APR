To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the treatment of different types of indexers, specifically the `list` indexer. The cause of the bug is that when using a `list` indexer, the function `self.loc[key]` raises a `KeyError` for all cases, leading to inconsistent behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the handling of the `list` indexer to align it with the behavior of other indexers such as array-like indexers. This would involve ensuring that when using a `list` indexer, it does not raise a `KeyError` and instead provides the appropriate output.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the recommended changes to the function, we ensure that the behavior of the `list` indexer aligns with that of other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

With these changes, the corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
