After analyzing the information available, it appears that the bug is related to how the `key` parameter is being handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. The key issue is that the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior.

The bug occurs specifically when `ser[list(key)]` is used as an indexer. This triggers a KeyError with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The bug can be fixed by ensuring consistent handling of indexers, regardless of whether they are list, ndarray, Index, or Series types. This will align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer", "mixed-integer-float"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the `key` parameter consistently, resulting in the expected behavior for all cases, including list indexers.

This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
