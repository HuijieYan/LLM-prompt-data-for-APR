To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where a list indexer is passed to the Series. The bug occurs when a list indexer is used and triggers a KeyError due to the difference in treatment of list versus other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, which results in inconsistency in behavior when accessing elements via indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers behave similarly to other array-like indexers when accessed through the Series. This means that the bug can be resolved by making the behavior consistent for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function will ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers when accessed through the Series, resolving the bug and making the behavior more uniform.
