One potential source of the bug is that the function does not handle the input key appropriately, leading to the failure of the test case. Specifically, the `ser[key]` operation in the test function is meant to trigger the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. However, the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function do not clearly define how the function should handle a list-like input. 

The fix for this bug would involve explicitly handling both list-like and non-list-like input within the `_get_with` function. Additionally, the function parameters and their type should be verified and validated to prevent unexpected behaviors.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        # New blocks of code to handle list-like input
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif isinstance(key, Index) and (key_type := key.__class__).inferred_type == "integer":
            if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Don't know how to handle key: {key}")
```

The differentiation between list-like and non-list-like input has been made clear with the inclusion of specific clauses such as `isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` and `not is_list_like(key)`. The use of the assignment expression (`:=`) to define `key_type` ensures that the inferred type of the input is correctly identified and handled. This should resolve the bug and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test case.
