The buggy function `_get_with` checks the data type of the input `key` and takes specific actions based on the data type. However, it currently has multiple issues causing it to raise KeyErrors instead of returning the expected output.

The error occurs when the `_get_with` function tries to use the input `key` to index the Series. Since the key is not present in the index of the Series, it raises a KeyError.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input `key` is being handled correctly based on its data type and that the proper indexing is performed with the series object to avoid raising KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = np.asarray(key)
    if not is_integer(key) and not is_bool(key) and not is_categorical_dtype(key) and not is_object_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        if len(key) != len(self):
            raise IndexError("Item wrong length from _get_with")
        return self._get_values(key)

    if is_categorical_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key, copy=False)

    return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, the input `key` is checked, coercing to ndarray, and then further operations are performed to prevent the KeyError. This should fix the problem and the failing test cases.
