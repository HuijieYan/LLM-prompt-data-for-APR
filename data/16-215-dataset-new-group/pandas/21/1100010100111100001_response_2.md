The buggy function has an issue with how it handles different types of keys. It tries to infer the type of the key and decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer or label-based indexer, but it does not handle all cases correctly.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect inference of the key type, leading to the wrong selection of indexer (i.e., `loc` or `iloc`). The function does not correctly handle non-list-like scalars or convert the keys to lists when necessary, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different types of keys (lists, scalars, arrays, DataFrames) correctly and ensure that their types are inferred accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle scalar keys by converting them to lists, correctly infer the type of input keys, and manage the key types appropriately to use the correct indexing method (i.e., `loc` or `iloc`). This should address the issues identified and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
