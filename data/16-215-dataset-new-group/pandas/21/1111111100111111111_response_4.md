The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the different behaviors when using list indexers versus array-like indexers. The issue on GitHub indicates that the function treats list indexers differently and produces inconsistent behavior.

Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, it seems that the key_type variable should be determined from the type of key, and then the corresponding action should be taken based on the key_type.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle the different types of key appropriately, ensuring consistent behavior and handling all cases correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the redundant check for `is_list_like` and introduced the key_type variable to infer the type of the key. The rest of the logic handles the different key types appropriately to ensure consistent behavior for all cases. This fixed version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
