The issue in the `_get_with` function is the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers when handling a key with no matches. The other issue is that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all four cases, adding to the inconsistency.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that all array-like indexers behave the same way as the list case. This will make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This version of `_get_with` checks for the data type of the key and directly calls `self.loc[key]` if it's not a list-like type. Otherwise, it converts the key to a list and then calls `self.loc[key]`. This consistent behavior across different types of indexers should resolve the issue and the failing test case.
