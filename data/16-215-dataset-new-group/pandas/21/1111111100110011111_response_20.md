The issue is caused by inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class.

The bug occurs in the `self.reindex(key)` block of the `_get_with` function when an array-like indexer does not match any indices. This triggers a `KeyError` because the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other array-like indexers, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, which will align the behavior with the expectations and resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, all test cases should pass, and the function will consistently handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will align with user expectations and resolve the GitHub issue related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers in Series indexing.
