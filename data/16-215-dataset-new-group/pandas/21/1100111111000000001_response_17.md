The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file has several issues. First, it unnecessarily checks for specific types such as `list` or `Index`, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It also contains redundant checks to see if `key` is an instance of certain types, but then also checks if it's a different type multiple times.

To fix this function, we need to simplify the logic and streamline the checks for different types. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for handling the case where the key is not found in the index, as shown in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    if is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        # convert the key to a list
        key = [key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these changes, we simplify the function logic and ensure that the handling of scalar keys that are not found in the index results in a `KeyError`. After implementing this corrected version, the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass, indicating that the bug has been fixed.
