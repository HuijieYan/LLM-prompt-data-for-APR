The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers, specifically when trying to index with a list where there are no matches. The bug is causing the test to fail with a `KeyError` because it is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling the case of indexing with a list properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior when compared to indexing with other array-like structures. This leads to an inconsistency when trying to access a key where no matches are found, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code handles list indexers in the same manner as other array-like indexers. This will provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers, eliminating the `KeyError` when no matches are found.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the key is a list and if so, we convert it to an index using the `ensure_index` function. This ensures that list indexers are treated in the same manner as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and eliminating the `KeyError` for the failing test.
