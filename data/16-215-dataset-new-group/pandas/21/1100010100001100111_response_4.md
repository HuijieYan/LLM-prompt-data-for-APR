The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series. However, the behavior is inconsistent with different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError when a list indexer is used. 

The bug is caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError when trying to access a Series with a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, avoiding the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    if key_type == "integer" or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. This ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
