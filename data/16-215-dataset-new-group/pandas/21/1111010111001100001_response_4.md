## Fixing the Bug

The bug seems to occur when the input `key` is not recognized as a valid index for the Series, resulting in a KeyError. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `key` type and its conversion to positional or label-based indexing. Furthermore, the `key_type` is being inferred incorrectly, leading to the wrong indexing method being applied.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for detecting the type of `key` and its corresponding indexing method. We also need to ensure that the `key_type` is inferred accurately. 

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            if is_list_like(key):
                key = np.asarray(key)
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. When checking if `key` is an instance of `Index`, we now directly infer the `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype` to ensure accurate type detection.
2. We handle the case where `key` is list-like by converting it to a NumPy array if needed, and then inferring the `key_type`.
3. We added a condition to handle the case where the `key_type` is "string", which indicates label-based indexing.
4. We then return the appropriate indexing method based on the inferred `key_type`.
5. For all other cases, we reindex the Series using the `key`.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle different types of `key` inputs more accurately and pass the failing tests.
