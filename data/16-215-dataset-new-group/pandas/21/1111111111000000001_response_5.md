The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles non-matching index keys. When it encounters a non-matching key, it returns the result of the `reindex` function, which may not handle the case of non-matching keys correctly.

The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is specifically checking for the behavior when a non-matching key is used to index a `Series`. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised with a specific error message when a non-matching key is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case of non-matching keys and raise a `KeyError` with the specified message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    elif not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is a slice. If it is, we proceed with slicing as before. However, if the key is not a slice, we use the `isin` method of the index to check if all the elements of the key are present in the index. If not, we raise a `KeyError` with the specified message.

This fix ensures that the function correctly handles non-matching keys and raises a `KeyError` with the expected message, which will make the failing test pass.
