The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely to be at the part where the type of `key` is being inferred. It seems like the inferred type is not being assigned correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent conditional checks.

The bug causes the function to not correctly infer the type of the `key`, leading to incorrect branching in the conditional checks and ultimately leading to the wrong branch being executed.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the inferred type of the `key` is correctly assigned before branching off into the various conditional checks.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key_type` is being directly inferred from the `key` before the conditional checks, ensuring that the correct type is used for branching decisions. This should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing test case.
