To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to focus on the condition where the key is not list-like. The problem seems to be related to the conversion of the key and the inconsistent behavior when handling different types of indexers.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. The `loc` method should consistently raise a KeyError for all cases. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the key is not list-like.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key, copy=False)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for non-list-like keys and used the `reindex` method to handle this case consistently. This should resolve the issue and the failing test case provided earlier.
