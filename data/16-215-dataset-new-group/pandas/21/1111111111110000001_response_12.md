The issue with the buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class appears to be related to how it handles the input type for the `key` parameter, and its handling of scalar input types for the index. The failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` is called with different types of boxes, i.e., `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, and expects the same behavior. However, the test with the `pd.Series` fails, indicating that there may be an issue around how the function handles `pd.Series` as a key.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected, which seems to be related to how the input `key` is being handled and how the error cases are being managed within the function.

Based on the provided context, the cause of the bug can be identified as:

1. Incorrect handling of the `key` input parameter: The function `_get_with` does not handle the different types of inputs for the `key` parameter correctly, especially when it is a `pd.Series`.
2. Issue with handling scalar input types for the index: The function is not properly handling scalar input types for the index, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following strategies are suggested:
1. Check the input type of the `key` parameter: The function should correctly identify the input type (e.g., scalar, list-like, index) and handle it accordingly.
2. Resolve the indexing issue: The function should be updated to handle the different scenarios for indexing, including scalar input types and various types of input data.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Modified this section to handle the different cases for the key parameter
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # As item is of iterable type, the following block is generalized
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = 'integer'
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function `_get_with` can now correctly handle different types of input for the `key` parameter, including scalar input types, and ensures proper indexing behavior. This should address the identified issues and make the function pass the failing tests.
