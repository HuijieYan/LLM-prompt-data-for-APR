The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case when the key is a list-like object properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access the Series with a list key.

The bug occurs due to inconsistency in the treatment of different indexers in the function. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches." The issue points out that list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list-like keys in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers to ensure that accessing the Series with a list key does not result in a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the case for list-like indexers, array-like indexers, and Index objects
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Continue with the existing handling for other types of key like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now handle list-like indexers, array-like indexers, and Index objects properly, preventing the KeyError that was occurring previously. This fix ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
