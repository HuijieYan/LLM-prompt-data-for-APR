To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation is consistent for all types of indexers - list, array-like, and Index. 
The issue is that when using `ser[list(key)]`, the `KeyError` is raised, indicating that none of the indexers are in the index, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers. This inconsistency is reported in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

Given the input and output values, the bug is likely in the block of code handling the case where `key` is not list-like and not any of the specified types. The code then tries to infer the type of `key` and based on that type, decides whether to use `loc` or `iloc` to retrieve the data. 

The bug may be due to the incorrect inference of the type of `key`, leading to the wrong handling of the indexing operation.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the type of the indexer is correctly inferred and that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to ensure that the `key` is converted to an Index type. We then directly check the `inferred_type` of the key and use `loc` or `iloc` based on the inferred type. This ensures that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers.

This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the test cases pass without raising a `KeyError`.
