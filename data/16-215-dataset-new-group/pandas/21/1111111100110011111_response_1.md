The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers. When a list indexer is used, it is treated differently than when an array-like indexer, such as a DataFrame column, is used.

The expected behavior is for all types of indexers to behave the same way, but currently, the function is inconsistent in its behavior when dealing with different types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing the failing test as it expects the same behavior for all types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently. This means ensuring that the function behaves the same way when dealing with list indexers, array-like indexers, and DataFrame column indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the bug and pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # For all other cases, default to using loc
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle all indexers consistently by using `self.reindex` for array-like indexers and `self.loc` for all other cases, including list indexers.

This correction should ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently for all types of indexers, resolving the issue described in the GitHub thread and passing the failing test cases.
