The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be incorrectly handling different types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies and errors in specific scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the function include the logic for handling different types of indexers and the determination of the `key_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies and errors as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and other types of indexers, and improve the determination of the `key_type` based on the type of indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ('integer', 'mixed-integer'):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for `mixed-integer` type in addition to `integer` for `key_type`, as it may represent a mix of label and positional indexing. We have also improved the handling of list indexers to ensure consistent behavior. This should address the inconsistencies and errors mentioned in the GitHub issue.
