The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, and it is causing inconsistency in behavior.

The function fails to handle list-like indexers properly, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent results when accessing elements from a Series. This can be seen from the failing tests where the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, even when the input is an array-like index.

The bug seems to stem from the conditional handling of different types of indexers. The function should handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, and ensure that the appropriate type of indexing is applied based on the input key and the index type.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers correctly and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks whether the key is list-like and infers its type using `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the appropriate indexing method. This ensures consistent handling of both array-like and list-like indexers.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, resolving the issue and ensuring consistent behavior in accessing elements from a Series.
