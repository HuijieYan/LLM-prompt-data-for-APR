The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of indexers. It does not handle the case where the key is a list and throws an error. This contradicts the behavior with other indexers such as slices, DataFrames, and tuples. The issue on GitHub provides information about this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior for list indexers should be made consistent with other indexers.

The bug is likely to be located in the logic that handles list indexers. The function fails to handle the case where the key is a list and does not behave consistently with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling list indexers to be consistent with other indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case where the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # Handle the case where the key is a list
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")

```

This corrected function handles the case where the key is a list by returning the result of `self.loc[key]`. It also includes additional checks for unsupported key types to prevent unexpected behavior.

By making these changes, the function now behaves consistently with other types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
