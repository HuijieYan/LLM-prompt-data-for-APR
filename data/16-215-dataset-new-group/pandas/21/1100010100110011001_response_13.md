The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing a `KeyError` when attempting to use a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series as key to index a Series. 

The bug is likely due to the function's mishandling of the input key and its type. It seems that the function incorrectly determines the `key_type`, leading to the wrong output when trying to index the Series. This can lead to a `KeyError` in cases when the correct indexing operation should have been performed.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to correctly determine the `key_type` based on the input `key` and perform the indexing operation accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the different types of `key` inputs properly and perform the indexing operation accordingly. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
