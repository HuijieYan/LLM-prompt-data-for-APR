To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers. The issue on GitHub provides a detailed description and the inconsistent behavior exhibited when using different types of indexers.

In the buggy function, the inconsistent behavior is due to different handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers such as `pd.Index` and `np.array`. This causes the incorrect KeyError when using a list key.

To address this issue, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:  # Handle all other cases (e.g., list, Index, np.ndarray)
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to an Index
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `ensure_index` to ensure that any array-like key is converted to a consistent format, regardless of whether it is a list, Index, or np.ndarray.
2. For keys that are not array-like or Series, we simply use `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, which should resolve the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError issue reported on GitHub.
