This is a typical bug in the function `_get_with` where the bug is caused by the logic used to handle different types of key inputs, particularly when the key is not found in the index. The error message indicates that the key 'C' is not found in the index, but the function does not handle this case correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to improve how the function handles the key when it is not found in the index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the stated purpose of handling different types of keys.

The corrected version of the function `_get_with` is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise, handle different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle list_like and scalar keys
    if is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # reindex if key is not found in the index
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we remove the unnecessary checks for different types of keys and focus on the most relevant ones. Additionally, we handle the case where the key is not found in the index by reindexing.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles different types of keys and cases where the key is not found in the index.
