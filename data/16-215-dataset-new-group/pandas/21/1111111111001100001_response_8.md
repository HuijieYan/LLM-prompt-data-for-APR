The bug seems to be related to the identification of the key type within the `_get_with` function. The key type is being incorrectly identified as a string in all cases, which is causing the wrong branch of the if-else conditions to be executed.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key and handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if hasattr(key, "__array__"):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key.__array__(), skipna=False)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we are explicitly checking if the key has an array attribute and inferring its type using `lib.infer_dtype` if it does. If it doesn't have an array attribute, we raise a ValueError for unsupported key types.

With this correction, the function should correctly handle different types of keys and return the expected results, passing the failing test cases.
