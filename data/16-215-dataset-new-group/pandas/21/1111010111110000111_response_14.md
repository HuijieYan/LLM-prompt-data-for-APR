The bug in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a series with different data structures like lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index, or pandas Series.

The `test_getitem_no_matches` test is failing with a `KeyError` because the `_get_with` function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This behavior does not align with the expected behavior for all types of indexers.

The issue posted on GitHub highlights the inconsistent behavior and questions the compelling reason for it. The test added in #5880 is breaking with this inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to handle all types of indexers (lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series) consistently to ensure the expected behavior is the same across all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # Determine if we should use positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            indexer = self.loc
        else:
            indexer = self.iloc

        return indexer[key]

    if key_type in ["boolean", "mixed-bool"]:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently, the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing test, as well as the corresponding GitHub issue, should be resolved.
