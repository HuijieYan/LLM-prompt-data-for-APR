The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the key parameter. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and not handling it properly according to its type. Based on the failing test, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the key as a list-like object, and therefore it fails to perform the reindexing operation as expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly identify the type of the key using the `is_list_like()` function from the pandas library. Then, we can properly handle the key based on its type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle different types of keys and perform the reindexing operation as expected. This should make the failing test pass.
