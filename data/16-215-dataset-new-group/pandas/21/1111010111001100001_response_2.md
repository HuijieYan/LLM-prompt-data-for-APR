The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the key parameter. It seems that the function has a condition to check if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or not list-like, and then falls back to defaulting to label-based indexing using `self.loc[key]`. However, this approach may not work correctly for all types of keys.

The key_type variable is used to infer the type of the key, and in all case scenarios, it's being inferred as a string. This is likely an incorrect inference, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing the Series object.

To fix the bug, the logic for inferring the key type should be updated to correctly handle the different types of input keys. Additionally, the conditions for key types should be reviewed to ensure that the correct indexing method (`iloc` or `loc`) is used based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # updated inference logic
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for inferring the key type has been updated to handle different types of input keys more accurately. Additionally, the decision-making process for choosing between label-based and positional indexing has been improved.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test scenarios.
