The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function because the type of `key` is not being properly handled. The function incorrectly identifies the type of `key` in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior and raising a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not consistently handling different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as the key. This inconsistency results in the KeyError being raised when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior and proper handling of the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (float, int, str)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different types of indexers is updated to ensure proper handling and consistent behavior. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
