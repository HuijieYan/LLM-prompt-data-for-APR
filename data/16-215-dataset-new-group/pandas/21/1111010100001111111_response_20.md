Based on the input/output values and the GitHub issue, as well as the explanation provided, it seems that the issue lies in the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly with regard to list indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers, leading to a `KeyError` in some cases. It appears that the function is not handling list indexers appropriately, resulting in unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle list indexers consistently and appropriately. This may involve ensuring that list indexers are treated the same as other types of indexers, avoiding any unnecessary errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the conditional blocks related to `Index` and `integer` types, as well as the duplicate `list` check, and replaced them with a generic `else` block that handles list-like keys. This should ensure that list indexers are treated consistently and appropriately, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
