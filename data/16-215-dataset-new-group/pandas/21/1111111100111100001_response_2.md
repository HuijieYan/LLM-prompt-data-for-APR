The issue seems to be with the identification of the `key_type`. In all cases, the `key_type` is being identified as a string. This is likely incorrect, given the input parameter values. 

To fix the bug, the program should correctly identify the `key_type` based on the input type of `key` and handle it accordingly. It seems that the logic to identify the key type is not working as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle different types of input for key
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type in ["string", "mixed-integer-float"]:
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

The updated version of the function handles different types of input for `key` and identifies the `key_type` based on the input type of `key`. This should address the issue and make the function work correctly for all input types.
