The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the different behavior for list indexers compared to array-like indexers. Specifically, when using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError`, while it behaves differently for other types of indexers. This inconsistency is reported in GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access non-matching values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers and avoid raising a `KeyError` for list indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently, and it avoids raising a `KeyError` for list indexers. The function now uses `self.loc[key]` to access the values, which is consistent with the behavior for other types of indexers. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the function behave as expected in all cases.
