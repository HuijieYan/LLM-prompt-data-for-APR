The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing the failing test because it does not handle the case when a list is used as an indexer. When a list is used as an indexer, the function returns a KeyError, while it should return the expected behavior of the other indexer types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when a list is used as an indexer.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected `_get_with` function, it properly handles the case when a list is used as an indexer and returns the expected behavior. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure the function passes the failing test.
