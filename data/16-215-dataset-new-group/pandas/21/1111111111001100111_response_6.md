The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` highlights this inconsistency and the issue on GitHub also discusses this behavior.

The key issue is that when using a list indexer, the function should behave the same as when using other array-like indexers. However, the current implementation results in inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a list indexer, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats list indexers the same as other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by handling list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle non-list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]     
```

By handling non-list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, we ensure consistent behavior and address the issue raised on GitHub. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
