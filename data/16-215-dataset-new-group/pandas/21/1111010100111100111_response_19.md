Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug lies in the conditional statements handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series.Series` class. The failing test cases indicate that there are inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

The cause of the bug appears to be the conditional branches in the `_get_with` function handling the different types of indexers. The conditional branches for handling `list` and `Index` types seem to be producing different results, which leads to inconsistencies in behavior.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. One potential strategy is to review the conditional branches related to different types of indexers and unify the behavior for all cases to ensure consistency.

Based on the identified bug and the suggested strategy for fixing it, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            if not self.index.is_unique and not isinstance(key, MultiIndex):
                key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, the conditional branches have been modified to handle all types of key indexers in a consistent manner. This should address the inconsistencies in behavior observed in the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
