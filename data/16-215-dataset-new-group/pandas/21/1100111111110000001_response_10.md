The buggy function `_get_with` has multiple issues that lead to it failing the test provided. The function has an incomplete and incorrect logic for handling the key values being passed to it. 

The main cause of the bug is the improper handling of the key values based on their type. The function tries to handle different types of key values (`key`) and based on the type, follows a specific logic to process the key. However, this logic is flawed and either incomplete or incorrect in several cases.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs proper handling for each key type, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and list. Additionally, it should have a more robust approach for handling key types and avoid hardcoding data types. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self[key]

    # Check if key is bool indexer
    bool_indexer = check_bool_indexer(self.index, key)
    if bool_indexer is not None:
        return self.loc[key]
        
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

This revised version incorporates proper case handling for different types of key values and ensures that the logic is well-defined for each type. There's also a more comprehensive check for boolean indexing, which is a key issue being tested in the failing test cases. With these changes, the corrected version of the function is expected to pass the failing tests.
