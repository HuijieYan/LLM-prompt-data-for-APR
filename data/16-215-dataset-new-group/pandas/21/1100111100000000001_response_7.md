The bug in the _get_with method is that it does not handle all the possible types of the key parameter properly. The function is supposed to return a specific type of result depending on the type of key, but it does not do so correctly for all cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to handle each type of key appropriately and return the desired result. We'll also need to ensure that all possible types of key are being handled and that the function is returning the correct type of result for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        elif is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, we have updated the logic to handle each type of key correctly and return the desired result. We have also ensured that all possible types of key are being handled and that the function is returning the correct type of result for each case.

This corrected version should fix the bug in the _get_with function.
