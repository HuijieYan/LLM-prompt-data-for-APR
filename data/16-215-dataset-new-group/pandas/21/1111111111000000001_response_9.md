The issue with the `_get_with` function seems to be with the way it handles the key for indexing the Series. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised when a key that doesn't exist in the Series' index is passed, but the function is not currently handling this case correctly.

The bug seems to be in the logic for handling non-list like keys. The function checks if the key is not list-like, and if so, tries to use `self.loc[key]` to index the Series. However, the bug is that this method does not properly handle non-existent keys and does not raise the expected KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this, the function should handle the case where the key is not found in the index and raise a KeyError to match the expectation of the failing test.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # check if key is not in the index, then raise KeyError
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # for other scalar values, raise KeyError if it's not found in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the {self.index}")
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now correctly handles cases where the key is not found in the index and raises a KeyError as expected by the failing test.
