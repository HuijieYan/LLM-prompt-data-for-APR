Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The bug may be related to how the key is handled and how it impacts the `key_type`. The key_type is expected to be a string, but the implementation of key handling may be causing it to be something else.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is handled consistently for list indexers and array-like indexers. Specifically, we need to make sure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred and that it matches the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = ""
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to a list if it's not list-like, and then we correctly infer the `key_type` based on the input. This should help to handle different types of indexers consistently and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
