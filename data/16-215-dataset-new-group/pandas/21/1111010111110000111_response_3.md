The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the failure to handle the case of a list-like key, resulting in inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers. This inconsistency causes an error when attempting to access the series using a list key. 

The error message indicates that the key provided is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`. This discrepancy between list indexers and other array-like indexers is causing confusion and inconsistent behavior.

To address this issue, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is coherent across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like key
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a conditional block to handle list-like keys explicitly and applying the `loc` method to access values based on the key, we ensure a consistent behavior across different indexer types.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and aligns the behavior for list indexers with that of other array-like indexers.
