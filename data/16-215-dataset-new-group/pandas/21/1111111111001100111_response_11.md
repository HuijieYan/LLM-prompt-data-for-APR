The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of indexers and how it determines the type of indexer being used. Based on the failing test and the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the key type is being incorrectly identified as `'string'` instead of the expected types such as `'list'`, `'ndarray'`, or `'Index'`. This incorrect type identification is likely causing the function to take the wrong code path and subsequently lead to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified, and then handle each type of key appropriately to avoid the KeyError. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray)):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added an `is_scalar` check to handle scalar types appropriately, and we have rearranged the conditional statements to handle different types of key values in a more specific order, which should prevent the incorrect identification of the key type.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
