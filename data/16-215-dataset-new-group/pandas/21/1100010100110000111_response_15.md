First, let's analyze the bug and the error messages.

In the failing test, the function `ser[key]` is being called with different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). It is expected that the behavior of the indexers should be consistent, but the `list` indexer case is causing an error. The error message indicates that the key is not found in the index.

The GitHub issue is describing the same inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers. It mentions that treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers is causing inconsistent behavior. The issue suggests that the behavior should be uniform for all types of indexers.

Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in how the function handles list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in a way that ensures consistent behavior with other types of indexers. The inconsistent behavior should be resolved so that the function can handle all types of indexers uniformly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Uniform handling of all types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function now uniformly handles all types of indexers. Instead of treating list indexers differently, it now checks if the key is list-like, array-like, or any other type of supported indexer and handles them accordingly.

After applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
