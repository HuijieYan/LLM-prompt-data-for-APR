Based on the analysis provided, the issue with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it does not handle `list` input correctly, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of input such as arrays or indexes.

The cause of the bug is that when the input `key` is a list, the function does not handle it consistently with other input types, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to index the Series with a list.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle the case when `key` is a list in a consistent manner with other input types, such as arrays or indexes.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = 'list'
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when `key` is detected as a list, it is handled explicitly within the function by using `self.loc[key]`, which is consistent with the behavior for other array-like input types.

This correction should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to the behavior of `list` indexers compared to other types of indexers in a Pandas Series.
