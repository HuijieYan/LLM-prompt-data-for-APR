The bug occurs when indexing a Series using a list indexer, causing inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers. This results in KeyError being raised when attempting to access a non-existent index element, despite the behavior of other indexers like pd.Index or np.array. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _get_with function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not just a scalar
    if not is_list_like(key) or np.isscalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert the key to a list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fixed function, the test case that previously failed should now pass without KeyError being raised. This updated function treats list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub, leading to more consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
