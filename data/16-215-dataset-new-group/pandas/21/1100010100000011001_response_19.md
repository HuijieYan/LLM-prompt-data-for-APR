The buggy function has several potential error locations:
1. The if statements are not handling all possible types of input for the key parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The key_type variable is not being set correctly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when deciding whether to treat the key as a positional indexer or label-based indexer.
3. The handling of different types of keys is not consistent and could lead to incorrect results.

The function needs to handle different types of input for the key parameter and determine the key type correctly to make the decision between positional and label-based indexing. Additionally, the function needs to handle different types of keys consistently.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to add proper handling for different types of input for the key parameter, correctly determine the key type, and ensure consistent handling of different key types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the case where key is not list-like, e.g. scalar
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we first handle slice, DataFrame, and tuple types of keys as per the original function. Then, we determine the key_type using `lib.infer_dtype`. After that, we check the key_type for "integer" and handle it appropriately. If the key is not of any of the handled types, we assume it to be a scalar and use `self.loc[key]` for handling. This ensures proper handling of different types of keys and correct determination of the key type for indexing.
