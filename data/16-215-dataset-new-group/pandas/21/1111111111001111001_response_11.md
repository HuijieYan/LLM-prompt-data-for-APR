The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key_type`. The `key_type` should be inferred as "string" when the `key` is a list-like object containing a string. However, the code improperly infers the `key_type` as "integer" when the `key` only contains a single string or when it is an array. This results in the function attempting to reindex the series with the incorrect key type, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the `key_type` should be properly inferred based on the type of the `key` provided. We need to update the conditional statements to correctly handle different types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the type inference for the `key` parameter and return the expected results for the failing tests.
