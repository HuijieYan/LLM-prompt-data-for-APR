The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers, and specifically the inconsistent behavior when using a list as an indexer. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where using `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not. 

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for multiple cases, it appears that the issue arises with the handling of indexers of type list. The bug is specifically related to the handling of lists as indexers and the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with other array-like indexers to ensure that the behavior is the same across all types of indexers, thereby addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Make the behavior consistent for all array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers, as suggested by the GitHub issue, and addresses the bug in the `_get_with` function.
