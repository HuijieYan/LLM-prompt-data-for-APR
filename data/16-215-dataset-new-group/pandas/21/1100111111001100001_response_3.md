The issue with the buggy function is that the `key_type` is being incorrectly inferred as `'string'` instead of `'object'` when the input `key` is an array or a string. This incorrect type inference is leading to the wrong execution path in the function, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of the `key`. We should also handle the case where the `key` is a list or an array, and finally, we should handle the case where none of the above cases are true by calling the `reindex` function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        # handle the cases where key is string
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
            # handle the case where key is list or array
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            # handle all other cases
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle different types of `key` and avoid the KeyError that was previously occurring.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
