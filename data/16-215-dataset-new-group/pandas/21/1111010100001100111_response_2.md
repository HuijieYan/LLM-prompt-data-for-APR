Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of list indexers and array-like indexers differently. The GitHub issue also mentions the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers. The bug causes inconsistent behavior in the way the Series is indexed, leading to unexpected errors and NaN values, specifically when using a list as the index.

To address this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified such that list indexers and array-like indexers are handled consistently to ensure the expected behavior when indexing a Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we removed the condition to check if the key is not list-like and directly used `self.loc[key]`. This change ensures that regardless of the type of key (list, array-like, etc.), the correct behavior is maintained for indexing the Series.

This fix aims to address the inconsistent behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to indexing a Series with different types of keys.
