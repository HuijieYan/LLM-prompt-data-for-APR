Looking at the given code, the bug is likely located within the conditional checks for the type of "key" being passed to the function "_get_with". Specifically, in the case where "key" is not list-like, it attempts to use the "loc" attribute to index the Series. However, due to the mismatch between the key type and expected key type, this results in a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks do not handle all possible types that "key" can take. This leads to an incorrect branch being chosen, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to use the "loc" attribute.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the conditional checks to handle all possible types that "key" can take and ensure that appropriate actions are taken based on the type of the "key".

Here's the corrected version of the function "_get_with":

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where "key" is scalar separately by checking if it's a scalar using the "is_scalar" function. If it is a scalar, we use the "loc" attribute to index the Series. Otherwise, we proceed as before with key type checks and choosing the appropriate action based on the type of the "key".
