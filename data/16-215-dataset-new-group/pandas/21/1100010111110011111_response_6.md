## The issue with the buggy function

The `_get_with` function does not handle the case where a list is used as an indexer properly. This causes inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, such as array-like indexers and list indexers. The issue is linked to GitHub issue #5880, where the behavior of indexers was questioned.

## Potential error locations in the buggy function

The potential error locations in the `_get_with` function are the sections that handle the different types of indexers, specifically the handling of list indexers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "object":
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The handling of list indexers is now consistent with other types of indexers, ensuring that the behavior is uniform across different types of indexers.
- The `key_type` is inferred based on the type of indexer and then used to determine the appropriate action to be taken within the function.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers properly and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
