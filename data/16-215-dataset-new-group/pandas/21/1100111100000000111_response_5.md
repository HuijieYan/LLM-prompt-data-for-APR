The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the case where a list indexer is used to access the Series. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a KeyError when a list indexer is used, leading to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where a list indexer is used. The function should be modified to treat list indexers the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `elif is_list_like(key):` to handle list indexers, and used `self.loc[key]` to retrieve values when a list indexer is used.

By making this change, the function now handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
