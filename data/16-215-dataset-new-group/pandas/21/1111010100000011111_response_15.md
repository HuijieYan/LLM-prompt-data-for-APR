## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys and returning the corresponding values from the series.
2. The function checks for the type of the key and performs different operations based on the type. There are conditions for handling slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and other types of keys.
3. The bug may be related to how the function handles different types of keys, especially when it comes to lists and Index objects. The GitHub issue also suggests a problem with consistency in handling list indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior in handling different types of indexers, especially lists and Index objects.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key. It tries to handle the key differently based on its type, leading to inconsistent behavior for list indexers. This is related to the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue, where `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases involving different types of indexers.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, the function should treat list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This may involve modifying the conditions and logic for handling different types of keys.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        # Treat list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. We first check if the key is list-like and not an instance of an Index, and then use `self.loc[key]` to handle it consistently. Other conditions and checks for key types have been updated to ensure a more consistent and logical flow. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
