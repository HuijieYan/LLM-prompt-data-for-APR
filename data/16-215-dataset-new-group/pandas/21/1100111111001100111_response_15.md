The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and triggering a KeyError in certain cases. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing unexpected behavior and inconsistent results.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, such as lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index objects, and Series objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different indexers is unified to ensure consistent behavior across different types of input. This should resolve the unexpected behavior and pass the failing test cases.

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list, ndarray, Index, and Series objects consistently, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
