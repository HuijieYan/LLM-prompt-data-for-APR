The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the input key properly, which is causing the function to return the wrong value for `key_type`. This is leading to an incorrect behavior when processing the key and returning the result.

In the provided test scenarios, the key is a list or an array-like object, and the function is failing to handle these cases correctly. The function should identify the type of the key and then process it accordingly, returning the expected `key_type` based on the input key type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the input key types and determine the correct `key_type` to be returned based on the type of key.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function handles the key types properly and infers the correct `key_type` based on the type of key passed as input. Now, when the function is given a key as in the provided test cases, it should return the expected `key_type` and process the key appropriately.
