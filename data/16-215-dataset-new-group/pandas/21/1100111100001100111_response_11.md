The issue appears to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `Series` class when there are no matches found. The `ser[list(key)]` operation is throwing a `KeyError`, while other similar operations do not.

The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that when `key` is a list and there are no matches found, it is still trying to use `self.reindex(key)`, which is causing the `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list and there are no matches found. Instead of trying to reindex using the key, we should directly return `NaN` values for any unmatched indices.

Also, given the GitHub issue, it seems that making all cases behave like the list case might be a reasonable approach.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list
    
    if len(set(key).intersection(self.index)) == 0:
        # No matches found, return NaN for unmatched indices
        return pd.Series(np.nan, index=key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first convert `key` to a list. Then, we check if there are any matches between the elements of `key` and the index of the series. If none are found, we return a new series with `NaN` values for all unmatched indices.

This should fix the issue described in the GitHub report and handle the case when there are no matches for the indices in the series.
