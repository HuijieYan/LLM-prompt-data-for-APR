The bug in the function `_get_with` causes the failing test to indicate that a `KeyError` is not raised when accessing a key that does not exist in the index. This suggests that the function is not handling the key properly.

The function makes a series of checks to determine the type of the key. However, in the cases provided, the function incorrectly assigns the `key_type` variable the value `'string'`. This indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, and therefore, it is not handling certain cases properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately determine the type of the key and then properly decide how to handle the key based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, RangeIndex)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ("integer", "floating"):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I explicitly check for the types `pd.Index` and `RangeIndex` and extract the inferred type from these objects if they are encountered. Additionally, I check for `integer` and `floating` types as valid key types, rather than just a generic `string` type. This ensures that the function can properly determine the type of the key and handle it accordingly.
