### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The code for handling the different types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series) may be causing the bug.
2. There might be an issue with the conditional checks and type conversion of the key variable.
3. The use of loc[] and iloc[] methods may also be contributing to the bug.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The bug results in a KeyError when using a list indexer, but not when using other types of indexers. This inconsistency violates the expected behavior from the Series indexing.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series) are handled consistently. Additionally, the conditional checks and type conversions of the key variable need to be reviewed to ensure proper handling of different indexers.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring consistent handling of different indexers and reviewing the conditional checks and type conversions, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
