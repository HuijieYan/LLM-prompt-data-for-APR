The issue is related to the behavior of the `__getitem__` method for different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`). The error message is consistently raised when using a list indexer, indicating that the behavior for list indexers is different and inconsistent with other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the `__getitem__` method is not handling list indexers in the same way as other indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and error messages, as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `__getitem__` method should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent way with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list indexers consistently with other indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By modifying the `__getitem__` method to explicitly handle list indexers, we ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer being used. This fix will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
