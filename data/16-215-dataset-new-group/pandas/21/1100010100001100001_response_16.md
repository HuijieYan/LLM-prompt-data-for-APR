The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is that the logic for identifying the type of `key` is not working correctly. This leads to the incorrect identification of `key_type`, causing the function to return the wrong output.

The problem lies in the section of code where `key_type` is identified. There are also redundant checks for `key` type before identifying `key_type`.

To fix the bug, we will remove the redundant type checks and update the logic for identifying `key_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = 'string'  # Assuming key is a list of strings

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the redundant type checks and updated the logic for identifying `key_type` based on the type of `key`. We also assumed that if `key` is not identified as a specific type (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, or Index), it is treated as a list of strings. This assumption may vary depending on the specific requirements of the function.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct output for different types of `key`.
