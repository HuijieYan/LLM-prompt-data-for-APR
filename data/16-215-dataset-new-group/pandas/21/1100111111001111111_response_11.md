The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the way list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. In the failing test, when a list key is passed to the `ser[key]` operation, it raises a KeyError with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This behavior is inconsistent with the other cases, where the same key type does not raise a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of keys.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list and array-like indexers has been unified to ensure consistent behavior. This fix should resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass.
