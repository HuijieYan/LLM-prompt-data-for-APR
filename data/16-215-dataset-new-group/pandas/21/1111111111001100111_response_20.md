The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles different types of indexers, particularly when a list indexer is used. The function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and causing a KeyError in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles all types of indexers consistently. It should treat list indexers the same way it treats other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError and maintain consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will treat all array-like indexers consistently, ensuring that list indexers do not cause a KeyError and maintaining consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
