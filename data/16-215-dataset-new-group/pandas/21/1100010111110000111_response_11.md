The issue arises from an inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers as compared to array-like indexers, leading to different behaviors for different types of input. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test, where the same operation behaves differently based on the type of indexer used.

The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers appropriately, leading to a KeyError in the failing test. The function makes distinctions based on the type of indexer provided, but it does not handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior for all input types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the input `key` is list-like, and if so, converts it to a list before using it as an indexer. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
