The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects. The function fails to handle the Index case properly, leading to inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency with different types of indexers and the unexpected behavior when using a list indexer. The user suggests that the behavior should be consistent across all types of indexers to improve the API's usability.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently and handle the Index case properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = 'integer'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle the 'integer' case explicitly
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the `Index` and `np.ndarray` cases by setting the `key_type` to `'integer'`, and then handle the 'integer' case explicitly. We also modified the condition for handling the `Index` case to ensure proper behavior.

This should resolve the inconsistency and properly handle different types of indexers.
