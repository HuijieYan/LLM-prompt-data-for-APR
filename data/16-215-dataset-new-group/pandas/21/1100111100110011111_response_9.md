To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like indexers. The function should be updated to handle all indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the correct exception is raised when the key does not match any index values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
```

This corrected version ensures that all indexers, including list-like indexers, are handled consistently. If the key does not match any index values, a `KeyError` is raised with the appropriate message, as expected.

With this correction, the function will pass the failing test and produce the expected output in all cases. Additionally, this fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
