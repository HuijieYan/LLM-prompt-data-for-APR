The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not treating list indexers the same way it treats array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer, while it works correctly with other types of indexers. This is inconsistent behavior and does not align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, I will modify the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers the same way it treats array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and resolve the KeyError issue highlighted in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar to a list

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function now ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
