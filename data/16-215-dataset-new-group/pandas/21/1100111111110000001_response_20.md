The buggy function `_get_with` seems to have a problem with the `if not is_list_like` block around the middle of the function.

The failing tests indicate that the function is failing to raise a `KeyError` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle non-existent keys and does not raise a `KeyError` when a key is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we should add a block of code to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' is not found in the index")
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, and therefore will pass the failing test cases.
