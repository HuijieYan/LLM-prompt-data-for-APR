The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the Series class in the pandas library. The issue seems to be inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers.

Based on the runtime values and types of input parameters, we can see that the key_type is consistently evaluated as `'string'` before the buggy function's return. This suggests that the bug may be related to the determination of the key_type and the subsequent indexing based on this type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior. We can check the type of the key and handle it accordingly, ensuring that the correct indexing approach is used for different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have rearranged the conditions to handle different types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior for each case. We also correctly determine the `key_type` based on the type of the key and handle the indexing accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure correct behavior for all types of indexers.
