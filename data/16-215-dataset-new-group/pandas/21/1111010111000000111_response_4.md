The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing issues with the indexing behavior when using a list as an indexer. The problem is that list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected results and error messages when using a list as an indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to incorrect behavior and error messages when attempting to index a `Series` with a list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check if the key is a slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # Check if the key is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    # Check if the key is a tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # Check if the key is not list-like
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Default case: reindex the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent and resolves the issue reported on GitHub. This should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior when using list indexers with a `Series`.
