The bug in the provided function is likely due to a mistake in the logic for determining the type of the 'key' parameter. Based on the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is incorrectly classifying the type of 'key' as a string in all cases, regardless of the actual type of the input 'key'.

Suggested fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the type of the 'key' parameter and handle it accordingly. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of 'key' in various input cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added the `ensure_index` function to ensure that 'key' is always appropriately converted to an Index type before proceeding to determine its type and handling it accordingly. This should address the incorrect type detection issue seen in the buggy function.

Please note that the actual fix might need to involve additional considerations based on the specifics of the pandas library implementations and the behavior of related functions.
