The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in the behavior of the buggy function when using different types of indexers. The discussion in the GitHub issue indicates that the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like indexers, and there is a compelling reason to make all of them behave like the list case.

Upon analyzing the function and its relationship with the related classes and test code, it seems that the bug occurs when the type of indexer is a list, causing a KeyError in the function. The function should handle the list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of the other indexers.

Based on the analysis, a strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling list indexers to match the behavior of array-like indexers. This may involve updating the conditional statements and logic to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all list-like indexers consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statement for handling list-like indexers has been updated to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. The handling for list indexers now aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
