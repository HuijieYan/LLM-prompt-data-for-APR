The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError when indexing a Series with a list-like object. The failing test cases all demonstrate this issue when trying to index the Series with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the list-like object properly, leading to a KeyError. The key_type variable is incorrectly assigned a value of 'string' regardless of the actual type of the key, which leads to incorrect branching in the function.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle list-like objects and ensure that the key_type variable accurately reflects the type of the key being used for indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle list-like objects
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles list-like objects and ensures that key_type reflects the correct type of the key being used for indexing. With these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
