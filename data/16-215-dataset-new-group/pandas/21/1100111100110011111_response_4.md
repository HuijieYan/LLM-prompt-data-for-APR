To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the way we handle different types of indexers. The issue arises from treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. We need to make sure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers, including lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects.

One potential strategy to fix this bug is to update the conditional checks to handle different types of indexers in a consistent manner. We can modify the code to ensure that the behavior for all types of indexers is consistent and aligns with the expected behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the explanation provided:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # all scalar indexers should be handled by self.loc
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the case for list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series
    # to ensure consistent behavior
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this modified version of the `_get_with` function, we have updated the conditional checks to handle different types of indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior for all types of indexers aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
