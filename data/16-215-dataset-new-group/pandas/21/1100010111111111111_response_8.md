The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as an indexer. The issue is related to the different behavior observed when using a list indexer compared to array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue as well.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to have consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers. Specifically, the behavior of list indexers should be aligned with the behavior of other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers has been made consistent. It now correctly handles list indexers, aligning their behavior with array-like indexers.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values. The issue posted on GitHub should also be resolved by this correction.
