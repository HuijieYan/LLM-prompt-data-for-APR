The bug in the given function `_get_with` seems to be related to how it handles the input `key`. It checks the type of `key` and performs different operations based on its type, but the handling of certain types might be incorrect, leading to the failure of the provided test cases.

A potential error location is in the block of code that handles non-list-like `key`. The function uses the `loc` attribute to perform indexing when `key` is not list-like, but it does not handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` correctly. This might be causing the function to return an incorrect result.

The failing test cases indicate that the bug might be related to how `key` is handled when it is not list-like. The error message also suggests that the indexing operation fails to raise a `KeyError` as expected.

To fix the bug, I would suggest modifying the handling of non-list-like `key`. Specifically, the function should handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` more robustly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or not is_scalar(key):
        # handle scalar values
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should properly handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` and perform the indexing operation correctly.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
