The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to index a `Series` with a key, but there are multiple issues with the indexing logic, resulting in a `KeyError`.

One issue is that the `key` is being modified in the function, so when the original `key` is used for indexing, the modified version is not recognized, causing the `KeyError` to be raised.

The `key` is being modified in the following code:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
By converting `key` to a list, this will change the behavior of indexing with the original `key`.

To fix this issue, we can remove the code that converts `key` to a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
With the modified function, the issue of modifying `key` before indexing is resolved. Running the failing test cases should now pass without raising a `KeyError`.
