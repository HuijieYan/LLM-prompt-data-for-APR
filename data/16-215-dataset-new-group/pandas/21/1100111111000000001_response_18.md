The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the mishandling of the `key` parameter, especially when it is an instance of `list` or `np.ndarray`. It fails to differentiate between positional and label-based indexing, and it also seems to be attempting to use `.loc` and/or `.iloc` indexers on non-DataFrame objects, leading to the `KeyError` exception.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the `key` is a list or numpy array, then use the `.iloc` indexer for positional indexing and the `.loc` indexer for label-based indexing. Additionally, we should handle cases where `key` is neither of these types. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

This corrected version should handle the various types of inputs for the `key` parameter and apply the appropriate indexing method without raising a `KeyError` exception.
