The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The potential error locations are where it checks for the type of `key` and the subsequent branching logic based on its type.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles different types of keys which could lead to type errors or incorrect behavior, especially when dealing with different types of keys such as scalar, list-like, or boolean.

To fix the bug, we need to streamline the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that the appropriate methods are called for each type. Additionally, we need to handle the case of DataFrame indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # handle scalars
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like input
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # for other types, reindex if applicable
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the slice, DataFrame, and tuple cases as before. We then check for scalar and list-like keys separately and use `loc` to fetch the values. For other types of inputs, we simply reindex them if the case isn't handled previously.

This updated logic ensures that the function correctly handles different types of keys and behaves appropriately in each case.
