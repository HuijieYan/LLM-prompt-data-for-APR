The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect type inference for the `key_type` variable. This causes the function to return the incorrect value for the given input, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` variable is inferred correctly based on the type of the input `key`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `key` is a list or numpy array of strings, as these are currently being incorrectly classified as an `integer` type.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series)) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that if the `key` is a numpy array, list, or Series containing only string values, we directly use the `loc` indexer to handle the lookup.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
