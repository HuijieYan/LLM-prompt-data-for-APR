Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with others:
- The buggy function is a method called `_get_with` within the `Series` class, a subclass of the `NDFrame` class.
- Inside `_get_with`, the method `_slice` is called, along with other helper methods like `_get_values_tuple` and `reindex`.
- The failing test calls the method `__getitem__` using different types of input `box`, which is then passed into the `_get_with` method.

Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The error could be due to incorrect handling of the input types inside the `_get_with` method, resulting in KeyError being raised.

Explain the cause of the bug:
- The `_get_with` method does not handle the inputs correctly, causing a KeyError to be raised in certain conditions, such as when key type is list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
- This leads to a failing test which expects the behavior to be consistent across different input types passed to the `__getitem__` method.

Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the condition statements inside the `_get_with` method to ensure proper handling of different input types.
- Add specific cases and handling for list, ndarray, Index, and Series to ensure consistent behavior.
- Ensure that KeyError is not raised when using these input types to access elements from the Series.

Given the buggy function, provide a corrected version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version updates the condition statements and handles different input types more consistently within the `_get_with` method. It also ensures that correct methods such as `loc` and `iloc` are used based on the key type. This should address the KeyError issue and make the function pass the failing test.
