To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue with how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The failing test indicates that `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`, while the other indexers do not.

The bug seems to be in the handling of list indexers at this line:
```python
return self.reindex(key)
```

It appears that the `reindex` method is not correctly handling the list indexer. To fix this, we need to modify the way list indexers are processed in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a specific handling for list indexers before any further processing. This ensures that list indexers are correctly handled and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

With this correction, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
