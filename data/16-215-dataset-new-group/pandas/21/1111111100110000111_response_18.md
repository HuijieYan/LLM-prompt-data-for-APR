## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` file. It is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and array-like objects, and return the corresponding values from the `Series` object.
2. The error messages indicate that when using a list indexer, the code raises a `KeyError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, specifically focusing on the behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not properly handling list indexers, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases.
5. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic in the `_get_with` function to identify the specific conditions that handle different types of indexers.
2. Modify the logic to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a `KeyError`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling list indexers has been updated to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
