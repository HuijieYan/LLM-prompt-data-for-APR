The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of keys. The function is not handling the `list` type of indexer properly, leading to a KeyError exception.

The issue is with how the `_get_with` function processes different types of key input, especially when the key is a list type. The current implementation is inconsistent and leads to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the different types of indexers, including when the key is of type list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # For scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the list indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the `list` type of indexer by returning `self.loc[key]` when the key is a list. This modification ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolves the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.

This corrected version should address the problem and produce the expected output for all test cases.
