The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when `key` is a list index. It should treat list indexers the same way as array-like indexers, but it does not behave consistently in those cases. This inconsistency is causing issues with the indexing behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the function that handles the case when `key` is not an array-like indexer. We should ensure that list indexers are treated the same as array-like indexers and provide consistent behavior between different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat list indexers the same as array-like indexers
    if key_type in ["integer", "list"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list indexers the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
