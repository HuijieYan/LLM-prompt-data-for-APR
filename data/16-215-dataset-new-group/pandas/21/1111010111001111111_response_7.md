The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior when accessing a Series using list indexing. This bug causes a KeyError to be raised when using list indexing, while it works as expected with array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and handle list indexing like the other cases. We should also make sure that accessing the Series using list indexing does not raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test and provide the expected output values for all input cases. It will also resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
