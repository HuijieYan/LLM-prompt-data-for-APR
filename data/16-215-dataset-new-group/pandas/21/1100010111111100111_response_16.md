The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError when attempting to index a Series with a list. The function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The problem lies in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with list-like indexers. The function incorrectly raises a KeyError when a list-like indexer is used, even though the indexer should be valid.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle list-like indexers, ensuring that they are treated in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (bool, np.bool_)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, type(self.index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks for a boolean indexer, scalar key, or list-like key before handling each case accordingly. The function also distinguishes between different types of indexers and handles them appropriately.

This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly. With this fix, the failing test cases should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
