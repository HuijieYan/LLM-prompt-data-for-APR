The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists, in order to return the corresponding values from the Series. However, it is encountering an error with the handling of key types and inferring the key type.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly determining the key type and is not handling the different key types correctly. This is leading to unexpected behavior and errors when trying to return the values from the Series.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to add proper type handling and inference for different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists, and determine the key type correctly. Additionally, the function should handle the different key types according to their inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine the key type
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    raise ValueError("Invalid key type")
```

This corrected version properly handles different key types and infers the key type before determining the appropriate action to return the values from the Series.
