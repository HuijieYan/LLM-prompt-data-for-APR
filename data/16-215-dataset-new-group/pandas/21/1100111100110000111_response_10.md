The problem in the buggy function lies in the condition where the key is a list, resulting in inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The error message from the failing test indicates that the KeyError is raised when using a list key. This issue is also addressed in the GitHub issue, which points out the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the condition for a list key needs to be addressed to ensure consistent behavior with array-like indexers. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition for a list key to handle it consistently and avoid raising a KeyError.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function that addresses the inconsistent behavior:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Updated condition to handle list key consistently with array-like indexers
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Updated to handle list key consistently
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    
```

With the corrected version, the function now handles a list key consistently with array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is the same across different types of indexers. This modification resolves the inconsistency in behavior and addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
