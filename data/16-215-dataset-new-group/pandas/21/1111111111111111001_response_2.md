The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function, leading to a KeyError being raised. The issue seems to be related to the way the key is being checked and processed for different data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is properly handled and processed based on its type. We can use conditionals to check the type of the key and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        # Handle different key types
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list) and is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle all other cases (e.g., scalars)
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function includes conditions to properly handle different types of the key and provide the expected output. This should resolve the KeyError being raised and make the function pass the failing tests.
