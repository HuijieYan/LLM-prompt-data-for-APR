After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related classes and functions, the GitHub issue, and the error messages, it appears that the bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The specific error message indicates that a KeyError is raised when using a list indexer, while the same operation with other types of indexers does not raise this error.

The bug is likely caused by the function not handling list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and the KeyError being raised only for list indexers.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with the handling of array-like indexers. This could involve modifying the conditional logic for different types of indexers or adding explicit handling for list indexers to match the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # E.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure consistent handling of list indexers by including them directly in the logic for array-like indexers. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub thread.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values and types.
