The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, leading to failing tests and an open GitHub issue. The issue is related to the discrepancy in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError and inconsistent results.

The potential error location is within the conditional checks for different types of key. It seems that the logic for list-like keys is not handling the Index type correctly, causing the KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for different types of keys are not properly handling the Index type, leading to inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for different key types need to be revised to handle the Index type and align the behavior with array-like indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    # ... (other cases)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
       key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

With these changes, the function will now properly handle Index type along with list, ndarray, and other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and the KeyError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and close the GitHub issue.
