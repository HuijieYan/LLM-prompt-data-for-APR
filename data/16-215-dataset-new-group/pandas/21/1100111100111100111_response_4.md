Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors, especially when using a list indexer. The failing test cases indicate that the function is unable to handle list indexers properly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This should address the inconsistency in behavior and resolve the errors reported in the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is converted to an index using `ensure_index(key)`, and then it is checked for being an integer index using `is_integer(key)`. Based on the type of key and the index type, the function returns the appropriate result, thereby ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers.

This correction should address the inconsistency in handling indexers and resolve the errors reported in the failing tests.
