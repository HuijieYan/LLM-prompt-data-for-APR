## The Issue
The issue arises from the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers on a Series. Specifically, when using a list indexer that does not match any values in the Series, the behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers such as array-like or Index.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) on a Series. The bug occurs when using a list indexer that does not match any values in the Series. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is related to the type checking and handling of the indexer (`key`) inside the function. The function does not handle list indexers that do not match any values in the Series appropriately, leading to inconsistent behaviors.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used on the Series. Specifically, the function should handle list indexers that do not match any values in the Series in a manner consistent with other types of indexers. 

To achieve this, it may be necessary to review the type checking and handling logic in the `_get_with` function and make adjustments to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not (isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or key.inferred_type == "integer" or key.inferred_type == "boolean"):
        key = list(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the type checking and handling have been modified to ensure that list indexers that do not match any values in the Series are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This modification aims to resolve the inconsistency in behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
