The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is intended to perform various types of indexing on the Series object, depending on the type of the `key`. However, there seems to be an issue with the modification of the `key` variable within the function. When the `key` is not of type `list_like`, it attempts to access the `loc[key]` method. The problem is that for certain input types, the `.loc[]` method does not raise the expected `KeyError`. Additionally, the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` is likely incorrect because a Series object should not accept a DataFrame for indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `loc[]` method correctly raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, and revise the condition for accepting a DataFrame object for indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we've modified the last `elif` block to handle any type of index and removed the redundant code for handling multiple types of keys. It now directly uses `self.loc[key]` for indexing, which should raise the expected `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.
