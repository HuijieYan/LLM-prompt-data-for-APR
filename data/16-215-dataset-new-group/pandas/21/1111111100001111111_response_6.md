The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case where a list-like object is passed as the key parameter properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not treating list indexers the same as array-like indexers, leading to different behavior and inconsistency with other cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats list indexers the same as array-like indexers and handles them consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # All non-list-like indexers are handled consistently
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert the key to a list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)

    # Use loc for label-based indexing and iloc for positional indexing
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers the same as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
