The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different types of indexers are being handled. The error messages indicate that when using a list indexer, a KeyError is being raised, while using other types of indexers does not result in an error.

The function seems to be assuming that if the key is not recognized as an array-like indexer, it should be considered a positional indexer. This assumption is incorrect, resulting in the KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, without assuming that a key not recognized as an array-like indexer should be considered a positional indexer.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks if the key is a DataFrame or Series and raises a TypeError. Then, it converts the key to a list if it's not already list-like and uses `reindex` to handle the indexing operation consistently for all types of indexers.
