Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the Series. The issue points out that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, and there is an inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers. The test that checks this behavior was added in #5880.

The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to how it handles the key parameter, especially in cases where the key is not recognized as an array-like indexer. The bug may be causing inconsistent behavior when using list indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, I added an additional condition for handling string type key for consistency. This will resolve the inconsistent behavior and align with the expected output in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
