## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, and boolean, and returning the corresponding values. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers and the inconsistency in behavior when using `ser.loc[key]`.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The handling of list-like indexers may be causing the inconsistency in behavior.
2. Determining the type of key using `lib.infer_dtype` and the subsequent branching based on the key type may have a bug.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the inconsistency observed when using list-like indexers (`ser[list(key)]`), which causes a `KeyError` to be raised. This behavior is not consistent with how other types of indexers are handled. The bug may be related to the determination of the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` and the subsequent branching based on the key type.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review the handling of list-like indexers to ensure consistency with other types of indexers.
2. Review the code that determines the key type and the branching based on the key type to make sure it's correctly identifying the type of key and handling it appropriately.
3. Address the inconsistency observed with `ser.loc[key]` and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Bug fix
The bug fix for the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is to address the inconsistency with list-like indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string', 'boolean']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the branching based on the key type and added additional checks to handle different types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior. This should address the bug and resolve the inconsistency observed with list-like indexers.
