The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the buggy function `_get_with` when indexing a Series with different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, etc.). The specific error message indicated that the behavior of indexing a Series with a list indexer is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

Based on the bug's characteristics and the failing tests, it seems that the bug may be related to the recognition and handling of the list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function should correctly handle list-like indexers to achieve consistency with other types of indexers.

One potential cause of the bug could be the check for list-like indexers, which might not be implemented correctly. This could lead to an inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent and aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list-like indexers using the `is_list_like` check, which should ensure consistency with other types of indexers and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.

After incorporating this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior regarding the indexing of a Series with different types of indexers.
