## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and expected input/output values, it seems that the main issue is with the inferred_type variable and how it is used in the code. By ensuring the correct type inference and handling the different types accordingly, we can fix the bug.

In the corrected version, we have fixed the way key_type is assigned and used in the function to handle different types of keys appropriately. This should ensure that the function now correctly handles different types of input and returns the expected output.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test cases.
