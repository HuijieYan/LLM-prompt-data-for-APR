The bug in the provided function is that it fails to handle the case where a key is a single string or a list of strings. This causes the function to return an incorrect key_type, leading to a failure when trying to index the Series with the given key.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the case where the key is a single string or a list of strings by checking the type of the key and returning the appropriate result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case where the key is a single string or a list of strings, preventing the bug from occurring.
