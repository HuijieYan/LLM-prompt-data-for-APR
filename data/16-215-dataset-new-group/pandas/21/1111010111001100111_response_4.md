To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when accessing the Series.

The cause of the bug is that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency results in the KeyError being raised for the list key, while not for other types of key.

To resolve this, we can update the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers the same way as array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and address the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle list, ndarray, and ExtensionArray indexers consistently, ensuring that the KeyError issue is resolved.

This correction ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other array-like indexers, providing consistent behavior and addressing the reported GitHub issue.
