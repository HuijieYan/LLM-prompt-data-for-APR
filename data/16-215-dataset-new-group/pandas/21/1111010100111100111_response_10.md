### Bug Location
The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are within the conditional statements for different types of `key` input. Specifically, the issue is likely related to the handling of different data types for the `key` parameter.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing failures in the tests because the function is not handling different types of `key` parameters consistently. The failing tests indicate that the behavior differs when using list, ndarray, Index, and Series as the `key` parameter. The bug is causing inconsistency in the behavior of the function based on the data type of the `key` parameter, leading to unexpected KeyError and TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle different data types for the `key` parameter consistently. It should have a clear and uniform approach to how it processes different types of input to ensure the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
