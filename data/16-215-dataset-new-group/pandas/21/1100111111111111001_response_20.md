The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the keys properly and is not raising a `KeyError` when expected.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle different types of keys, such as a list, an ndarray, an Index, or a Series.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of keys correctly and raise a `KeyError` when a key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # All other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, list):
            key = ensure_index(key)
            if not key.isin(self.index).all():
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            if not key.isin(self.index).all():
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif isinstance(key, Series):
            if not key.index.isin(self.index).all():
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.reindex(key.index)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version, we handle different types of keys separately. For lists and ndarrays, we ensure that all the elements are present in the index. If not, we raise a `KeyError`. For Index and Series, we perform a similar check and raise a `KeyError` if any of the elements are not found in the index.

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass, and the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and raise a `KeyError` when a key is not found in the index.
