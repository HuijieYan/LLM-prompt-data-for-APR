The issue with the provided function is that the logic does not properly handle the type of the `key` parameter and does not account for the case where `key` is a single value. The function seems to incorrectly infer the type of the `key` parameter, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to accurately identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle each type appropriately. Additionally, the function should consider the case where `key` is a single value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (str, np.character, np.unicode_)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the type handling issues and adds specific checks for different types of the `key` parameter. It first checks if the `key` is an integer or a string, and then handles the slice and DataFrame cases. Finally, it falls back to reindexing for any other type of `key`.

This corrected version should now correctly handle the input cases provided and satisfy the expected output values.
