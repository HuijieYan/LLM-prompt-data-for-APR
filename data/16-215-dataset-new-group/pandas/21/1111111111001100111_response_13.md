The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. The inconsistent behavior is causing the `KeyError` for the `ser[list(key)]` case, while the other cases (`ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`) do not raise an error.

After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug lies in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. The code fails to handle the case where a list indexer (`list(key)`) is used.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that it handles list indexers correctly. This may involve updating the approach to handle the different types of indexers consistently.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been updated to ensure that it aligns with the logic used for other types of indexers. This should address the inconsistent behavior and resolve the `KeyError` for the `ser[list(key)]` case while aligning with the expected behavior for the other indexer types.
