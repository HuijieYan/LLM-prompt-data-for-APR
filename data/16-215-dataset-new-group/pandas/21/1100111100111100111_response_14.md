The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the `list` type correctly, causing inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` in certain cases, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function handles the `list` type in a consistent manner and produces the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case when key is a list
    return self.loc[key]
```

This version of the function ensures that if the `key` is not a list-like type, it returns the result of `self.loc[key]`. This approach makes the behavior consistent for all indexers and should resolve the `KeyError` issue described in the GitHub post.
