There is a bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The bug causes inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when accessing a Series object, as reported in GitHub issue #5880. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when attempting to access a Series with a list indexer that contains no matches, while array-like indexers behave differently and do not raise this error.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it checks for the type of the `key` parameter and handles the different cases. Specifically, the block of code that handles the `list` type case seems to be the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list, array-like, and other cases, when accessing a Series object.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # The logic for handling different key types and reindexing
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like keys by converting them to a list if they are not already in list form. This ensures consistency with other indexers. Additionally, the logic for handling different key types and reindexing has been adjusted to ensure proper behavior with all types of keys.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
