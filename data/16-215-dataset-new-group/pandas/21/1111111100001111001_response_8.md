Based on the given information, it seems that the bug in the _get_with function is likely due to incorrect handling of the key_type variable. The key_type should be determined based on the type of the key parameter, but the function is not doing this effectively.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that key_type is accurately assigned based on the type of the key parameter. If the key is a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, the key_type should be inferred accordingly. If the key is a single value (e.g., scalar), the code should correctly check if it is a boolean, integer (positional indexer), or string type.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype([key], skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we accurately infer the key_type based on the type of the key parameter. We also use lib.infer_dtype to handle non-list-like keys, and ensure that the key_type is appropriately used to determine the indexing strategy.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for all the given test cases.
