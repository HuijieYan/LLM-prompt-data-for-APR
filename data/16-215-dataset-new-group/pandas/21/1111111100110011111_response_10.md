The bug appears to be related to the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`. It seems to be causing an issue with the handling of different types of indexers, specifically the list indexer, leading to a KeyError being raised when accessing the Series with a list indexer.

The bug seems to be caused by not handling the list indexer properly and raising a KeyError when trying to access the Series with a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to handle the list indexer appropriately and prevent a KeyError from being raised.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = [key]
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This version handles the list indexer appropriately and ensures that a KeyError is not raised when accessing the Series with a list indexer. It also includes a check for multiple types of potential indexers.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the GitHub issue related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers.
