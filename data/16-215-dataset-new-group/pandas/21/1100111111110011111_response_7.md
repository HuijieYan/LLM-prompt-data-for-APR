The issue with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency results in the `KeyError` raised in the failing test cases.

The bug seems to originate from the conditional statements that check the type of the `key` parameter and how it's handled. The conditional block that handles the `list` type of `key` is where the inconsistency arises.

To fix the bug, the conditional handling of different types of indexers needs to be made consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the inconsistent treatment of list-like indexers has been addressed, and the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
