The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, etc.) in different ways, leading to inconsistent behavior. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, as stated in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to treat all types of indexers consistently and handle them in the same way.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):  # Only handle list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version treats all indexers consistently by first checking if the `key` is list-like. If it is, it attempts to `reindex` with the `key`. If a `KeyError` is raised, it provides a more informative error message as per the GitHub issue.

This should address the inconsistency and align the behavior with the expected output.
