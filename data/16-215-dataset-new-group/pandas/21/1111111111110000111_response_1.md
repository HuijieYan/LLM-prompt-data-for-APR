## Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. When the method is called with a list-like indexer, it raises a `KeyError` rather than returning `NaN`. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other array-like and index-like indexers. The failing test in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` confirms this inconsistency.

The failing test passes a list-like indexer to the `ser` Series, and the expected behavior is to return `NaN`. However, the method raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected NaN.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the conditional statement that handles the list-like indexers. It incorrectly raises a `KeyError` instead of handling it to return the expected `NaN`, as it does for other indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the conditional statements to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like and index-like indexers. Specifically, the code should be corrected to ensure that when a list-like indexer is passed, it returns `NaN` instead of raising a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version should handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers and return the expected `NaN` instead of raising a `KeyError`. It resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
