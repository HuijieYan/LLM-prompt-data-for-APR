The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of input for the `key` parameter. It appears that the function is not handling the input `key` properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the series.

The bug seems to stem from the block of code that checks the type of the `key` parameter and processes it accordingly. It fails to handle some types of input correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks for different types of input and ensure that the function properly handles each case. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function is returning the correct result when the key is processed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# ... (other parts of the class)

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added new conditional checks for boolean and integer keys, and we handled each case appropriately. We also included a check for list-like keys before further processing. Additionally, we made sure to cover various types of input and handle each case properly. This should address the issues causing the KeyError in the failing tests.
