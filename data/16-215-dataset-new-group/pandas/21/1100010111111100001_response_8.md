Based on the analysis of the failing tests and the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables within the buggy function, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of the key parameter. Specifically, the key parameter is not being properly processed, leading to a KeyError being raised in the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of different types of key inputs, such as lists, arrays, indexes, and series. Additionally, the key_type variable is being incorrectly assigned a value of "string" in all cases, which could be leading to incorrect type inference and processing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key parameter is properly handled based on its type. Additionally, the type inference for the key_type variable needs to be corrected to accurately represent the type of the key input.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have made changes to the key_type inference by using the is_integer function to accurately determine the type of the key input. We have also added additional checks to handle different types of key inputs appropriately. These changes should address the issues identified in the failing tests and ensure that the function works as intended.
