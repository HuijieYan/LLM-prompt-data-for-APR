To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the handling of list indexers. The issue described in the GitHub post also points out this inconsistency and suggests that all cases should behave like the list case.

Looking at the failing tests and the runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of list-like indexers. The function is not consistently treating list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, which results in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. We can achieve this by using the `reindex` function to align the Series with the provided index before returning the result. This will ensure consistent behavior for all indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, addressing the inconsistency and resolving the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.
