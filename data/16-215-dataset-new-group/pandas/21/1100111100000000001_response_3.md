The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter and improper condition checks. The function seems to be intended to handle different types of keys and select the appropriate method for accessing the data, such as `loc`, `iloc`, `reindex`, etc. However, the condition checks and type handling seems to be causing the issue.

One potential cause of the bug is that the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` only handles scalar values, but it does not handle other non-list-like objects properly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to revise the condition checks and type handling to cover all possible types of `key` values, ensuring that the function can handle each case correctly and select the appropriate method for data access.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid key type")
```

In the corrected version, I have added an extra condition to handle scalar values and improved the handling of different types of `key`. Additionally, I have added an exception for handling unsupported key types.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function can handle various types of `key` inputs correctly.
