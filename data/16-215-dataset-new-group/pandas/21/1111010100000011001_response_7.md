The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a series. However, there are potential issues in the code that can cause the function to return incorrect results or raise errors.

The potential issues identified in the code are:
1. In the section where the key type is inferred, there is a check for the key type being "integer" and a decision is made to use positional indexer (`self.iloc`) or label-based indexer (`self.loc`). However, it's possible that the key type is incorrectly inferred, leading to the wrong indexer being used.
2. There is a conflation of handling for different types of keys, which can lead to confusion and incorrect indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and that the appropriate indexer (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) is used based on the key type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key type is inferred based on the input key, and the appropriate indexer (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) is used accordingly. This should ensure that the function handles different types of keys correctly and returns the expected results based on the key type.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and types provided for the failing test cases.
