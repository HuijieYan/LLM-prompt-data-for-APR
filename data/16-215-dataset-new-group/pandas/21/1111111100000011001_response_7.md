The bug in the provided code is that in the last part of the function `_get_with`, the `key_type` is not being correctly assigned and the conditional checks are not handling the various types of `key` input properly.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect assignments and checks of the `key_type` variable, as well as the incorrect handling of the `key` variable which can be of various types.

To fix the bug, we should first properly handle the various types of `key` input and then correctly assign the `key_type` variable. We can also update the conditional checks based on the new handling of the `key` input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle different types of key input
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = getattr(key, 'inferred_type', key_type)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Update conditional checks based on the new handling of key input
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the different types of `key` input using `is_scalar` and `is_list_like`. Then, we correctly assign the `key_type` based on the type of `key`, and update the conditional checks accordingly. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
