The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list. The issue on GitHub describes how list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, causing an inconsistency in the behavior of the `ser` object when using different types of keys.

The bug is likely located in the handling of the `list` type in the `_get_with` function, as seen in this line:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This conditional statement is only handling indexing when `key` is not list-like, but it should handle list indexers differently from other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle list indexers separately, and make them behave consistently with array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle list indexers separately for consistent behavior
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, we added a separate handling for the `list` type in the `if isinstance(key, list):` condition to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with a list. Additionally, we restructured the conditional statements to handle different types of keys more explicitly and consistently, following the guidelines and suggestions provided in the GitHub issue.
