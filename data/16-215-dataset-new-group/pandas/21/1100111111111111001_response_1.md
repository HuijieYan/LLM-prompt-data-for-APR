The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect assignment of the key_type variable, which leads to incorrect execution paths in the subsequent conditional statements.

To fix the bug, the key_type variable needs to be correctly assigned based on the type of the key. It should be inferred properly so that the subsequent conditional statements operate as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, key_type is correctly populated based on the type of the key. This ensures that subsequent conditional statements work as intended, leading to correct behavior of the function.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
