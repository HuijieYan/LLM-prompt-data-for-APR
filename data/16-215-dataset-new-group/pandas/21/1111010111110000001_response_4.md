The issue with the `_get_with` function is that when it receives `key` as an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, it raises a TypeError rather than performing the expected operation. There are also some issues with the condition checks and type checking in some parts of the code. 

To fix this issue, the conditions checks should be updated, and the code should be refactored to correctly handle the various types of input `key` received.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, dict):
        key = list(key.keys())

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The main modification made to the function is that the first `elif` condition has been adapted to accommodate Series and dictionary input types. Additionally, the type checking has been updated to handle dictionary types, and the conditions are now more clearly separated.

After making these changes, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test case should pass successfully.
