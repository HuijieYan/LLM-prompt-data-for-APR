The issue with the buggy function is that the `key_type` variable is being incorrectly identified as `'string'` for all input cases, regardless of the type of `key` provided. This is likely due to the way the `key_type` is being inferred from `key`. The function is not correctly identifying the type of `key` in some cases, resulting in the incorrect execution path.

To fix this bug, we need to improve the method used to identify the type of `key`, and ensure that it correctly identifies the type of `key` provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self._index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_bool` method is used to check if `key` is a boolean, and `is_list_like` is used to check if `key` is a list-like object. Additionally, the check for `str` type is added to avoid misidentification of string types as other non-indexable types.

By using the correct methods for type checking and adding the necessary additional checks, the corrected version of the function should properly identify the type of `key` and execute the correct path accordingly.
