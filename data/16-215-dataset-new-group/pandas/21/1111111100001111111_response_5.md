The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling a list-like key in the Series class. It's failing to return the expected output for list-like keys.

The expected behavior is for the function to treat all indexers consistently, whether a list, array-like, or index.

To fix this bug, the function should handle list-like keys in the same way it handles array-like keys. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like and array-like keys are handled consistently, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
