The issue seems to be with the logic that determines the type of the key being used for indexing. The buggy function seems to be incorrectly classifying the type of the key, which leads to the KeyError being raised in the test cases.

The `key_type` variable in the buggy function is not being properly determined and is always being set to `'string'`, which seems to be incorrect based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to properly identify the type of the key and handle the indexing appropriately based on its type. This can be done by using the correct methods to check the type of the key and then perform the indexing operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use `is_scalar` to check if the key is a scalar value. We also revised the logic for determining the `key_type` and handling the indexing operation based on the type of the key. This should ensure that the correct type of indexing is performed based on the type of the key being used.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the various types of keys being used for indexing, and the KeyError should no longer be raised in the failing test cases.
