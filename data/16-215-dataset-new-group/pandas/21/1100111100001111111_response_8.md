The issue described on GitHub focuses on the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series using different types of indexers (e.g., list indexers, array-like indexers). The example provided in the issue demonstrates that using a list indexer results in a KeyError, while using other types of indexers (e.g., pd.Series, pd.Index, np.array) does not.

Based on the runtime and expected values, it seems that the bug is related to key_type being incorrectly identified as 'string' instead of 'object'. This results in incorrect handling of the indexing operation, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that key_type is correctly identified based on the type of the indexers being used (e.g., list, ndarray, Index) before performing the indexing operation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I removed redundant conditions and added a new line to ensure that key_type is correctly determined based on the type of the key before performing the indexing operation.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the different types of indexers consistently and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
