The bug lies in the conditional checks for the type of `key` in the `_get_with` function. The conditional checks are not covering all the possible types of `key` correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
- Ensuring that all possible types of `key` are covered in the conditional checks
- Making sure that the variable `key_type` is assigned the correct type based on the type of `key`

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):       
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible types of `key` are handled in the conditional checks and correctly assigns the `key_type` based on the type of `key`.
