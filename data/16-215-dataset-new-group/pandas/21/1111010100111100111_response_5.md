The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, which leads to a KeyError in certain cases. This inconsistency is causing the failing tests and has been identified in a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, and to avoid raising a KeyError. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list-like object
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This revised version ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers, and it avoids raising a KeyError in the test cases provided.

With this fix, the failing tests from the GitHub issue should pass.
