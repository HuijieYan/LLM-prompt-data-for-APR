The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not correctly handle parameter `key` of type pandas.core.series.Series. When the function is called with a key of type pandas.core.series.Series, it raises a KeyError rather than returning the required output.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect type handling within the function, where it fails to handle a pandas.core.series.Series as a valid key type. It wrongly assumes that a key of this type is not list-like. This results in the function incorrectly trying to reindex the key, causing a KeyError to be raised.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle a key of type pandas.core.series.Series, treating it as list-like and implementing the appropriate logic to access the elements in the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```
