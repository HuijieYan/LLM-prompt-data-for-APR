The issue seems to be caused by the _get_with function in the Series class, which has a bug handling the retrieval of items from the Series. It is not properly handling the key parameter when it expects certain data types. The failing test cases show that when attempting to access items with a certain type (list, array, index, series), the function does not throw the expected KeyError when the item is not found in the index.

To fix this, we need to revise the logic inside the _get_with function to properly handle different types of key parameters and throw the KeyError when an item is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.dtype.kind == "b":
        return self._get_values_bool(key)

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the condition for dealing with a Boolean array (key.dtype.kind == "b") is added to handle boolean indexing.

With this corrected logic, the function should now correctly handle different types of key parameters, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
