The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists. However, it fails to handle list-like objects correctly, as demonstrated by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

The failing test cases and the GitHub issue indicate that when a list indexer is used, the function raises a KeyError, stating that "None of [index] are in the [index]". This behavior is inconsistent with how slice and array-like indexers are handled, and it also conflicts with the expected behavior when using `ser.loc[key]`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list-like indexers properly and consistently with other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        if isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added specific handling for list-like indexers, ensuring that it is consistent with other indexers and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread. Our modifications also provide more flexible handling for different types of indexers.
