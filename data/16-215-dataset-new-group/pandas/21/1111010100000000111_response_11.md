After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`, along with the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches," it's clear that the bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistency in how the `Series` class handles various types of indexers, as demonstrated in the GitHub issue. The issue specifically points out that using a list indexer (`ser[list(key)]`) results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we can make the behavior of list indexers consistent with other array-like indexers. This means ensuring that `ser.loc[key]`, `ser[np.array(key)]`, and `ser[pd.Index(key)]` all behave the same way as `ser[list(key)]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Making behavior consistent for all array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, we first convert the key to a list if it's not list-like, and then handle the indexing based on the inferred type of the key. This ensures that the behavior is consistent for all array-like indexers, including lists, arrays, and Index objects.
