Based on the code provided, the bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by improper indexing and handling of data types being passed as the `key` parameter. The series object fails to correctly identify the data type of the `key` parameter, resulting in the incorrect handling of the indexing operations based on the data type.

To fix the bug, we should first check the data type of the `key` parameter and then perform the indexing operations accordingly. Additionally, to improve the code readability and clarity, we need to handle the conditional checks for different data types in a more comprehensive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        if is_extension_array_dtype(key) or is_object_dtype(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version of the function `_get_with`, we first check if the `key` parameter is of type `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, or any scalar value. Then, using the relevant checks, we perform the indexing operations. This ensures that the data type for the `key` parameter is properly handled based on the associated actions. Additionally, we check if the `key` parameter is of type `list_like` or `Index` with separate checks to execute the relevant logical operations based on the data type. This makes the code more comprehensive and error-free.
