The buggy function is `_get_with` from the `Series` class in the file `pandas/core/series.py`. This function seems to have multiple potential error locations. The key type determination logic, including the handling of the `list` type, appears to be causing the bug.

The failing test indicates that when using a list-like indexer, the `ser[key]` operation raises a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the elements in the index are found. As per the GitHub issue, this behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers are handled, and it seems that the bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers.

To fix this bug, we should review the logic for determining the key type and its corresponding indexing behavior, particularly for list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        try:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers by first converting them into an index using `ensure_index(key)`, and then attempting to perform the `loc` operation. If a `KeyError` is encountered during this operation, we explicitly raise a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the elements in the index are found.

This approach ensures that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers and addresses the issue raised on GitHub.
