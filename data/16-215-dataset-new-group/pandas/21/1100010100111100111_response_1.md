To fix the bug in the _get_with function, the issue at hand is the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) with the Series. The key error occurs when trying to access the Series with a list indexer.

The root cause of the bug is the difference in handling different types of indexers. The _get_with function does not handle list indexers the same way as it handles array-like or Index indexers. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function needs to handle list indexers the same way it handles array-like and Index indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior when accessing the Series with different types of indexers. Additionally, the function should use the same logic for all types of indexers, whether it be positional or label-based indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = list(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the key is list-like and not an instance of ABCSeries before converting it to a list. This ensures that list indexers are handled the same way as array-like and Index indexers.

This fix will ensure that the behavior of accessing the Series with different types of indexers is consistent and will resolve the KeyError when using a list indexer.
