To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of indexers, especially the list indexers. The bug causes inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer.

The expected behavior is that the function should handle list indexers similarly to array-like indexers and return the correct result without raising an error. The corrected version of the function should address this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the key is not list-like or is an ndarray or Index. In such cases, we use the `reindex` function to return the result. For other cases, including when the key is a list, we use the `loc` function to return the result without raising an error.

This approach ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other indexers, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem statement and providing the expected behavior for different types of indexers.
