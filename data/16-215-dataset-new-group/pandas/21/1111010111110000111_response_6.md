The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class in the pandas library is causing an inconsistency in the behavior of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer compared to other array-like indexers.

The cause of this bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the list indexer case correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when a list indexer is used.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistency in the behavior of indexers, preventing the `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like and array-like indexers in the same way
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the list-like indexer `key` by using `ensure_index` to transform it into an Index object, allowing it to be used with `reindex`. This change will ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with that of other array-like indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue.

After making this change, the `_get_with` function should be able to handle list indexers and other indexers consistently, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
