The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled. The test case is failing because the function is not handling list indexers correctly, while it is handling other types of indexers such as array-like and Index indexers.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and expected values, it seems that the `isinstance(key, list)` check is not properly handling list indexers.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle list indexers in the same way it handles other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers the same way as other types of indexers
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other types of indexers
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `isinstance(key, list)` check has been modified to return the result of `self.loc[key]` for list indexers, aligning it with how other types of indexers are handled. This should resolve the issue stated in the GitHub report and make the failing test cases pass.
