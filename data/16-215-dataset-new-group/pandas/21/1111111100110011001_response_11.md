The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input `key` correctly and is not returning the expected output. The function is supposed to process the `key` parameter and return a specific value based on its type. It seems that the key_type is not being properly handled, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly identified and handled according to the expected behavior. We can add some additional checks and handle the key types such as "string" properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        # Handle string type keys
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle different types of the `key` parameter and return the expected values for the given inputs. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output values.
