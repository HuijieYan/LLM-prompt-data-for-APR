The cause of the bug is that the behavior of indexing with a list is different from indexing with other array-like indexers. This results in inconsistent behavior and raises a KeyError when trying to access a non-matching key using a list indexer. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]    
    elif key_type == "list":
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we added a new condition to handle the 'list' type for the key. If the key is of type 'list', we call the `reindex` function, which handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

This correction ensures consistent behavior for indexing with different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
