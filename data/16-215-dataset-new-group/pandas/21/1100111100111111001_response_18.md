The bug in the given function is likely due to incorrect handling of the input key, resulting in erroneous behavior and failing tests.

The bug seems to be occurring at the section of the function where it decides how to treat the key based on its type. It fails to handle the key correctly, leading to an error when attempting to perform the operation on the series.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the various types of keys presented to it, and ensure that the operation is carried out correctly based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif np.isscalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the Series index")
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the Series index")
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for scalar keys that are not present in the Series index, as well as properly handling DataFrames and Series as keys. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the failing tests.
