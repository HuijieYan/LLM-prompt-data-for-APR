The bug in the `_get_with` function causes it to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test, where using a list indexer raises a `KeyError` while using array-like indexers does not. The issue on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and questions whether there is a compelling reason for it.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional structure of the `_get_with` function. It incorrectly handles the case of list-like indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when indexing with a list.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional structure to handle list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different data types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # handle other cases by falling back to positional indexing
        return self.iloc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers in the same consistent manner as array-like indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue and ensure that indexing a Series with different data types produces the expected results.
