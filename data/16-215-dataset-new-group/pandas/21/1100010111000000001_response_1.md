The provided buggy function is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a pandas Series object. However, it contains several potential error locations, each of which could be causing the bug.

The potential error locations are:
1. The condition for checking if the key is an instance of an Index is incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if the key type is an integer is incorrect.
3. The condition for checking if the key is a list is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the key correctly, leading to a KeyError when accessing the Series with the given key in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the conditions in the function need to be adjusted to properly handle the different types of keys provided.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series method"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the different type checks have been modified, and the conditions for handling each key type have been adjusted to handle the cases more accurately. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
