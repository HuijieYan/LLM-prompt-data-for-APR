The bug is in the _get_with function of the pandas.core.series module. The bug causes different behaviors for different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list indexer is passed to the function, it raises a KeyError, while other types of array-like indexers work as expected.

The issue is related to the fact that list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior in the code. The failing test in the GitHub issue demonstrates that the behavior of using list indexers is different from using other types of array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the final block of the _get_with function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, the bug will be fixed, and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
