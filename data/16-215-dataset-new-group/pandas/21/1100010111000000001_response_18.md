The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by an incorrect check for a list-like input and an incorrect reindexing operation. The function incorrectly attempts to reindex the Series when the key is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should check whether the key is present in the index before attempting to reindex the Series. If the key is not present, it should raise a KeyError with an appropriate message.

Here's a corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # handle DataFrame key
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function will pass the failing test by properly handling the case where the key is not found in the index. Now, if the key is not present in the index, the function will raise a KeyError with the appropriate message, matching the behavior expected in the failing test.
