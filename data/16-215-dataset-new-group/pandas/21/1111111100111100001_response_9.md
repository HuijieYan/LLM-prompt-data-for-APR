The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the way it handles the `key_type` and the behavior when `key_type` is determined to be `'string'`. It incorrectly handles strings as integer keys, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access non-existent indices.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling the `key_type` and ensure that strings are properly handled as label-based indexing rather than integer indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes checks for scalar keys using `is_scalar`, and uses `is_list_like` to handle list-like keys appropriately. Additionally, it removes the unnecessary check for index type and determines the key type dynamically using the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions.
