To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case when a list indexer is used. The current function is not properly handling list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and failing tests.

The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly handling the list indexer and is raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we should update the handling of the list indexer within the `_get_with` function. We can modify the code to properly handle list indexers and ensure consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series types of key input.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a modified conditional block to properly handle the list indexer case and ensure consistent behavior for different types of key input.

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed and the failing tests should pass. The function will now handle list indexers correctly and provide consistent behavior for all types of key input.
