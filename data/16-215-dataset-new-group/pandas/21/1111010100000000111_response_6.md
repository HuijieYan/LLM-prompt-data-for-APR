The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing an issue related to inconsistency in the behavior of indexers when no matches are found.

The bug appears to be in the code that deals with list-like indexers. When the key is a list, the function is not handling the case where no matches are found correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where no matches are found when the key is a list. We can also make the behavior consistent with array-like indexers in this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling the case where the key is a list and when no matches are found
    result = self.loc[key]
    if isinstance(result, type(self)()):  # Checking if the result is an empty Series
        return self.loc[self.index[:0]]  # Returning an empty Series
    else:
        return result
```

In the corrected version, when the key is a list, we first attempt to perform the index operation and check if the result is an empty Series. If it is, we return an empty Series. Otherwise, we return the result as before.

This fix ensures that the behavior of list-like indexers is consistent with array-like indexers and addresses the issue of inconsistent behavior when no matches are found.

Please note that this fix assumes that the instantiating object `ser` has `pd.Series`-like behavior. If it's a different type of Series, adjustments may be needed.
