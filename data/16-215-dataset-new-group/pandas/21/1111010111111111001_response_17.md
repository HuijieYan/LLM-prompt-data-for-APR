The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling all possible types of the `key` input correctly. It seems to be expecting specific types and may not be considering others.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling the `key` parameter in the `_get_with` function to make sure it handles all possible types correctly. We can also add a case for handling a `Series` input into this function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCSeries)):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where `key` is a `Series` by using `isinstance(key, ABCSeries)`. This should allow the function to handle the input correctly and avoid the KeyError that was raised in the failing test.
