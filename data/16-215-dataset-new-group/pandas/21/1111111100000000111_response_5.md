The bug in the `_get_with` function causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. When using a list indexer with `ser[list(key)]`, the function raises a `KeyError` even if there are no matches in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of array-like indexers such as `np.array(key)` and `pd.Index(key)`.

The cause of the bug is related to how different types of indexers are processed within the `_get_with` function. The function fails to handle the case of list indexers properly, resulting in a `KeyError` even when there are no matches in the index.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly. Specifically, when encountering a list indexer, the function should check for matches in the index and return NaN for non-matching elements, consistent with the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            return np.nan
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexer
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        result = []
        for k in key:
            if k not in self.index:
                result.append(np.nan)
            else:
                result.append(self.loc[k])
        return Series(result, index=index)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, when a list indexer is used, the function checks for matches in the index, returning NaN for non-matching elements, consistent with the behavior of array-like indexers. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
