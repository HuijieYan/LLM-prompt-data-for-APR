The bug in the `_get_with` method is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access a key that is not present in the index. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter in the function. It's not correctly identifying the type of the `key`.

The issue could be occurring in the block that checks the type of the `key` parameter and later tries to determine the `key_type`. It's not correctly identifying the type of the `key` in some cases, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly identified and handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # For non-list-like cases, determine appropriate behavior based on the type of key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure the type of `key` is correctly identified and handled, which should prevent the `KeyError` from occurring in the failing tests.
