The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The issue pointed out on GitHub describes how list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The bug seems to be related to the `key_type` variable, which is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all runtime cases. This incorrect identification leads to inconsistent behavior when handling the different types of indexers.

To resolve this bug, we need to fix the identification of the `key_type` and ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Identify the data type of the key directly
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is identified directly using `lib.infer_dtype(key)`, ensuring that the function behaves consistently for all types of indexers. This should address the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
