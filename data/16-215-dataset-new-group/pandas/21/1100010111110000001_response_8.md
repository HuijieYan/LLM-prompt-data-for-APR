The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely related to the conditional statements. The existing code does not properly handle different types of keys, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

The failing test is trying to access a key from a Series object, and a KeyError is expected as a result. However, the function is not raising the expected KeyError, indicating that the function is not behaving as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that the function raises the appropriate KeyError when necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Check for invalid keys
        invalid_keys = set(key).difference(self.index)
        if invalid_keys:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {list(key)} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of different key types and ensures that any invalid keys lead to the appropriate KeyError being raised.
