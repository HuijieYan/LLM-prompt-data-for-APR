To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the discrepancy in behavior when indexing a Series using a list indexer versus an array-like indexer.

The bug occurs when indexing a Series with a list indexer, resulting in a KeyError for cases where the index does not contain the specified values. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of array-like indexers, which do not raise a KeyError in the same scenario.

We can address this bug by modifying the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle scalar or other non-list-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we check if the indexer is list-like using the `is_list_like` function. If it is, we convert it to an Index using `ensure_index` and then reindex the Series with the new index.

By handling list-like indexers consistently with array-like indexers, we ensure that the behavior is uniform and aligns with user expectations.

This correction addresses the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that indexing a Series with a list indexer behaves as expected.

Please integrate this correction into the pandas library and verify that it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
