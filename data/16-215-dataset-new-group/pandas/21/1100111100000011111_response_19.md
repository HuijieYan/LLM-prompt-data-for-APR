The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The function is not properly handling the case when a list indexer is provided. The bug is causing unexpected behavior when using list indexers, leading to inconsistent results compared to other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (including list indexers) are handled consistently. This involves identifying the type of the provided indexer and making sure that the correct approach is followed for extracting values from the Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check for string indexers, and it handles list indexers consistently by using the `lib.infer_dtype` function to determine the type of the key. Additionally, we added a check for boolean indexers using `key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean")` to ensure that all types of indexers are properly handled.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
