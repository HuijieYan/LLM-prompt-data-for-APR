The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key input in the `_get_with` function of the Series class. The function checks the type of the key and then proceeds to handle different types of keys differently. The bug might be caused by the incorrect type check or incorrect handling of certain types of keys.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the type checks are accurate and the handling of different types of keys is consistent and correct.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not list-like and not an Index
    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if it is not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    # Identify the type of key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different types of keys
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the identified bug should be fixed, and the function should work correctly for the failing test cases.
