The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the input `key`. The function is not properly checking the type of `key` before proceeding with the logic, which is causing errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the different types of input `key` correctly and handles each case appropriately. We should use proper type checking and logical flow to determine the appropriate action based on the type of `key`. Additionally, we need to consider the correct handling of `Index` and `dtype` of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (float, int, str)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we perform type checking to distinguish between different types of `key`. For each type, we handle the logic appropriately. We use `is_list_like` to determine if `key` is list-like and then perform the corresponding operation. For other types, we handle them separately. This approach ensures that the function handles different types of `key` appropriately, eliminating the bugs observed in the failing test cases.
