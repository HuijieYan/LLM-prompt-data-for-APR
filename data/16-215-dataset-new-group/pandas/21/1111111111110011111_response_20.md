To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to update the code to handle list-like key indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. The bug seems to be in the handling of the list-like key indexers.

### Causes of the bug
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in handling different types of key indexers, particularly list-like indexers. When a list-like key indexer is used, it raises a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior of array-like or Index key indexers. This inconsistency causes the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can update the code to handle list-like key indexers consistently with array-like or Index key indexers. This may involve modifying the conditional statements and the logic for handling different types of key indexers.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function
After analyzing the causes and the expected behavior, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like key indexers consistently with array-like or Index key indexers, as expected. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test cases to pass.
