The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where it checks if the `key_type` is equal to `"integer"`. This condition results in treating string keys as integers, leading to unexpected behavior and failing the test.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition that checks for the type of the `key` variable to handle string keys properly. We also need to make sure that the inferred type is correctly identified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
            # Handle string and integer keys separately
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes a new condition that explicitly identifies `"string"` as a valid key type and handles it separately from other types. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
