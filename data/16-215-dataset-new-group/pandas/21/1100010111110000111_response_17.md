The issue is related to the behavior of the `ser[key]` indexing when `key` is a list. The test is expecting consistent behavior regardless of whether `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series, but the actual implementation differs and throws a KeyError for the list case.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent behavior of the `_get_with` function when the `key` is a list. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test where it expects the error message to match for all types of keys (list, numpy array, Index, and Series), but it only matches for the list case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like keys consistently and does not throw a KeyError. To achieve this, we can modify the code to handle list-like keys in the same manner as other types of keys, such as numpy arrays and Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, if `key` is not list-like, it will still call `_convert_slice_indexer` and handle it in the same way as other types of keys. This consistency in handling different types of keys should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
