The bug in the function `_get_with` is that when the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an instance of Index, the function incorrectly tries to reindex it. This causes an error when trying to access an index value that does not exist in the original Series.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary reindex operation and handle the edge cases where the key is a single element or a non-list-like object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle single element keys and non-list-like objects, and it will only reindex the series when the key is recognized as an index or if it's a list-like object.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
