The potential error is occurring within the if-else statements that handle different types of key inputs. It seems that there is inconsistency in the handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers, which is causing the KeyError to be raised for the list case.

The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The specific case where a list indexer is used is not being properly handled, leading to a KeyError being raised.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with the handling of other types of indexers. This might involve modifying the conditional statements and the corresponding logic to ensure that list indexers are properly handled without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == 'string':
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we've added a specific condition to handle the case where the key is a list. If the key is a list, we check its inferred type and handle it accordingly. This should ensure consistent behavior for list indexers compared to other types of indexers and resolve the KeyError issue.
