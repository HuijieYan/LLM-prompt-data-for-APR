To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue where the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The function should behave consistently for different types of indexers to resolve the test failures.

After analyzing the runtime values and expected values, it is evident that the bug is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, particularly when using a list as an indexer.

The fix strategy involves making the function treat all types of indexers consistently, especially when handling list indexers. This will ensure that the function behaves uniformly for different indexer types and resolves the inconsistency observed in the failing tests.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and is expected to pass the failing tests:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # ...
    
    # handle list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # construct a new Index using the list as data
        key = Index(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function now ensures consistent handling of different indexer types, specifically when using a list as an indexer. This corrected version should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing tests.
