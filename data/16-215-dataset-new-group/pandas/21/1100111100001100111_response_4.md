The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, especially when they don't match any values in the Series' index. The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) and points out that using a list indexer leads to a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not.

The runtime input/output variable values in the failing test cases provide some insights into the cause of the bug:
- The `key_type` variable is set to `'string'` in all test cases, indicating that the logic for determining the type of the `key` is not functioning properly.

Based on the analysis of the failing test cases and the related GitHub issue, the bug appears to be related to the different types of indexers not being handled consistently, leading to unexpected behavior when using a list indexer. The key_type variable also seems to be incorrectly identified, leading to incorrect logic in the function.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function needs to be modified to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, and the logic for determining the key_type should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first ensure that the `key` is an Index type using `ensure_index`. Then, we use the `ensure_platform_int` function to convert the key to the platform integer type. After that, we infer the `key_type` and handle the cases accordingly. This modification ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and corrects the logic for determining the key_type.
