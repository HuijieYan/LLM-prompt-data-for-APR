## Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function

The following lines seem to be the potential error locations within the `_get_with` function:
- `return self.reindex(key)`

## Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing an inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test cases, where list indexers lead to a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not.

The primary issue seems to be with the specific check for list-like indexers and the return statement `return self.reindex(key)` when the key is of list type.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic specifically for list-like indexers and handle them appropriately to prevent the KeyError from occurring. Additionally, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers is essential to resolve the inconsistency reported on the GitHub issue.

## The corrected version of the function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex([k for k in key if k in self.index])
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling list-like indexers was modified to avoid raising a KeyError. The reindex function was updated to only include keys that exist in the index, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
