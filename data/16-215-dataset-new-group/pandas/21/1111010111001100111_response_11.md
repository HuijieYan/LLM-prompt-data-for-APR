## Analysis
The `_get_with` function is responsible for indexing a `Series` object. It handles various types of indexers and should return the subset of the `Series` based on the provided indexer. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` even though it should return `NaN` as shown in the test examples.

The issue on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers (array-like indexers). The behavior of the function for list indexers is incorrect and needs to be fixed to align with the expected behavior for array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause
The `_get_with` function mishandles list indexers, leading to a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` when an item is not found in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way it handles array-like indexers. This should align the behavior of list indexers with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Return NaN when the indexer is not found in the index
        return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan)
```

The corrected function now explicitly handles list indexers by using `reindex` with `fill_value=np.nan` to return `NaN` when an item is not found in the index, aligning the behavior with other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
