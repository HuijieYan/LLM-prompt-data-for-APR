The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing issues when indexing a Series using a list indexer. The function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which results in inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers properly and raises a KeyError with a message that indicates no matches are found in the index.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior when indexing a Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like indexers, providing consistent behavior when indexing a Series.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
