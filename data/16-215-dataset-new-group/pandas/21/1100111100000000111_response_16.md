The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when used with different types of indexers.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list, array-like, and index. The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently, such that the behavior is the same regardless of the type of indexer used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check for array-like indexers, and if the condition is true, we directly use `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing. Then, we handle the slice case in a separate condition, followed by the handling of a DataFrame indexer and a tuple indexer. Finally, for any other cases, we use `self.reindex(key)` to handle the indexing.

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
