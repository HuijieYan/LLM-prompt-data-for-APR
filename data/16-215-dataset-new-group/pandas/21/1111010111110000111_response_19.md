## 4. Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The bug seems to be related to the way the `ser[key]` behavior differs based on the type of the indexer. The issue on GitHub suggests that the inconsistency arises when using different indexers such as list, array-like, or Index, and the behavior differs for each case. Since the goal is to make all these cases behave consistently, it is important to revisit the implementation of the `_get_with` function to ensure that it handles the different types of indexers consistently.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves revisiting the conditions in the `_get_with` function that handle different types of indexers, such as list-like, array-like, DataFrame, tuple, etc. All conditions related to handling different types of indexers should be reviewed to ensure that they result in a consistent behavior for all cases.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional statements have been modified to handle different types of indexers consistently. The function now checks for integer indexers using the `is_integer` function and returns `iloc` for integer indexers, which should result in a consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
