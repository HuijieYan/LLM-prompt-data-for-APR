The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of the buggy function when indexing with different types of objects. The provided test function `test_getitem_no_matches` fails because the buggy function doesn't handle the case of `ser[list(key)]` correctly and raises a KeyError while it should return NaN. Additionally, `ser.loc[key]` also raises for all 4 cases, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The bug is coming from the handling of list indexers differently from array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect KeyError exception. The incorrect handling is causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to standardize the behavior for indexing with list and array-like indexers and make sure that all cases return NaN rather than raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the list and array-like indexers by converting them to a list, and then use `self.loc[key]` to return the values, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output for all the failing test cases, passing the tests and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
