The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of indexers of different types. When using a list indexer, the function throws a `KeyError`, but this behavior is inconsistent with other indexers such as array-like or Index. This leads to failing tests and does not align with the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is related to the improper handling of list key indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key indexer is used, it triggers an undesired behavior that results in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list key indexers in the same way it handles other indexers. We need to ensure consistency in the behavior of different key types to align with the expected outcomes.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `key` is not list-like and, if true, return the location based on the `key`. Next, we determine the `key_type` based on the type of the key. If the `key_type` is "string" or "integer", we then handle the index location accordingly. If not, we fall back to reindexing.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function will now handle list key indexers consistently with other indexers, fixing the bug and aligning the behavior with the expected outcomes from the failing tests.
