According to the analysis of the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue arises from the implementation of the `_get_with` function in the pandas series module. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` for the input `key`, leading to a failure to match the index and resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly infer the type of the `key` input parameter in all cases, and handle each type of `key` appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version includes better handling of the different types of `key`, ensures that `key` is converted to an index, and checks for scalar and integer types separately.

This corrected version should address the key error issues and the failing tests.
