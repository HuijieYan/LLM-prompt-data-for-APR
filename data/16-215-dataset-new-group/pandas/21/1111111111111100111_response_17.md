The buggy function `_get_with` incorrectly handles list-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This causes a KeyError to be raised for list indexers when attempting to access a Series, while other types of indexers do not raise the same error.

The cause of the bug is that when the key is list-like, the function is not handling it properly, leading to incorrect behavior and raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError when accessing a Series with a list-like key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when `key` is not list-like, the code remains the same. However, if `key` is list-like, the function ensures that it is handled consistently with other types of indexers to prevent raising a KeyError.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when accessing a Series.
