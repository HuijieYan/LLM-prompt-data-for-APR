The issue seems to be related to different behavior when indexing a Series with a list compared to other indexers. The bug in the `_get_with` function may be causing inconsistent behavior when using different indexers.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional blocks that check for the type of the `key`. Depending on the type of the `key`, the function should handle the indexing differently.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when the key is a list correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a list.

To fix the bug, we should modify the handling of the key when it's a list to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handle the case when key is a list
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        # handle the case when key is an array-like indexer
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_scalar(key):
        # handle the case when key is a scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle all other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now ensures consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, including lists, array-like indexers, and scalars.
