## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.) are handled by the `_get_with` function, leading to inconsistent behavior for certain cases, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers and infers their type. It also seems to be related to the handling of the key_type when determining how to access the data.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs adjustments in handling different types of indexers and inferring their type, as well as addressing the inconsistency in behavior for different cases.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
After analyzing the bug and considering the test case failures and the details provided, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    elif not is_scalar(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)

# Additional imports that may be required
from pandas.core.dtypes.inference import is_list_like
from pandas.core.series import ensure_index
```

In this corrected version:
1. We handle the key differently based on its type. If it's list-like, we ensure it's an index, and if it's not a scalar (i.e., a tuple or any non-scalar type), we convert it into a list.
2. We then perform the reindexing using the modified key.

This approach aims to address the inconsistencies mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that different types of indexers are handled properly within the `_get_with` function.

Please note that additional changes may be required in other parts of the codebase to fully address the issue and ensure consistent behavior across different cases.
