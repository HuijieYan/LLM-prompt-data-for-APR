The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the key input correctly for different types and is not consistent with the behavior of list indexers. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly distinguishing between different types of key inputs, leading to inconsistent behavior. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior of list indexers should be consistent with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles different types of key inputs and behaves consistently for list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Always use loc for single values
    
    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list if not already a list
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # infer key type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we've made the following changes:
1. Removed the redundant check for types like `np.ndarray` and `ExtensionArray` as they will be handled by the `is_list_like` check.
2. After the `is_list_like` check, we convert the key to a list to ensure consistency.
3. Infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` for consistent behavior.
4. Use `self.loc[key]` for single values to ensure consistency.

These changes will ensure that the function handles different types of key inputs properly and behaves consistently.
