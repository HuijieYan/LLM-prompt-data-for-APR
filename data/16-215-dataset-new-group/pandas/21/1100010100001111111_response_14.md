The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is related to the handling of different types of indexers in a Series object, causing inconsistent behavior when accessing elements using different types of indexers. The GitHub issue also highlights inconsistencies in the behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to ensure consistent behavior when accessing elements using different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Reindex in case of any other type of indexer
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures consistent handling of list-like indexers regardless of their specific type. This approach aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and resolves the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
