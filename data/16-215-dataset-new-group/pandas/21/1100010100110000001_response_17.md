First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the corresponding error message. The error message indicates that the test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when attempting to index a Series using a certain key. However, the `KeyError` is not being raised, which means there's a bug in the _get_with function thatâ€™s preventing the KeyError from being raised.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the if-elif-else statements where the key is being checked and processed.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the key, which is preventing the KeyError from being raised when it should be.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic handling of the key and ensure that the KeyError is raised appropriately, matching the expectation of the test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_dict_like(key) or is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_iterator(key) or is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have separated the logic for the different types of keys and added proper handling for each case, ensuring that the KeyError is raised when necessary. This should allow the corrected function to pass the failing test.
