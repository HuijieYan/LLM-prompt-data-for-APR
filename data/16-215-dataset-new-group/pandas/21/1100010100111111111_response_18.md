To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the handling of indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. The goal is to make all indexers behave the same way and only raise a KeyError if the item is not found in the index.

The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions. The failing tests indicate that there is a discrepancy in behavior between list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers when used with the `ser[key]` syntax.

To address this issue, we can modify the function to ensure that all types of indexers behave similarly and only raise a KeyError if the item is not found in the index, as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = self.index[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list) and not is_scalar(key):
        key = key.to_list()

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the handling of different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior. We first check if the key is not list-like, and if so, we use it to index the Series directly. Then, we handle non-list and non-scalar keys by converting them to a list.

This approach should address the issue of inconsistent behavior and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of indexers, satisfying the failing tests and the expected input/output values.
