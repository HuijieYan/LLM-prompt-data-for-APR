## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, and integers. The error messages indicate that when using a list as an indexer, the function does not behave as expected and raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with other indexers and does not match the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Potential error locations:
1. Handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. Inconsistencies in how different indexers are being handled and their corresponding behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency results in unexpected behavior and raises a `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer. The GitHub issue also points out this inconsistency and questions the reason for it.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers and addressing the specific issue with list-like indexers. One approach could be to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a manner consistent with other indexers, ensuring that the expected behavior is maintained across all cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key_arr)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have made changes to how list-like indexers are handled. By first converting the `key` to an array and then checking if it's list-like, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other indexers. This approach addresses the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub issue and maintains consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
