The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case of a list-like key correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError being raised for list indexers where it shouldn't. The function should handle list-like keys the same way it handles other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like keys the same way it handles other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list-like keys the same way as other array-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will handle list-like keys in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
