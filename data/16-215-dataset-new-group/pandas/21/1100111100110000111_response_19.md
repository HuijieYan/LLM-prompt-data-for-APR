## Analysis
The bug arises from treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series.

## Bug locations
The bug is likely caused by inconsistent treatment of list indexers and array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.

## Bug cause
The cause of the bug is the different handling of list indexers and array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when indexing a Series, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug fixing strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent treatment of list indexers and array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This may involve using a unified method to handle both types of indexers and avoiding the discrepancies that cause inconsistent behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if hasattr(key, "__array__"):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we unify the handling of list indexers and array-like indexers by directly checking if the `key` has an `__array__` attribute. If it does, we convert it to a numpy array using `np.asarray`. Then, we use `self.loc` to index the Series with the converted key. If the key is not an array-like object, we simply reindex the Series with the original key. This ensures consistent behavior for both list indexers and array-like indexers.
