The bug occurs when a Series is indexed with a list-like object, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects. However, it fails to handle the case when a Series is indexed with a list-like object, resulting in a KeyError.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list-like vs. other types of indexers, and it questions the reason behind this inconsistency.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers. This consistency will resolve the KeyError issue and align the behavior with the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the key is a scalar before attempting to access it using `loc`. Additionally, the handling of different types of indexers is consistent, resolving the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
