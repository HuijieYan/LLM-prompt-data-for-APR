The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the detection of the key's type, which is incorrectly assigning the type as `'string'` when it should be inferred as an array or list-like type. This leads to incorrect indexing operations and the subsequent `KeyError` when trying to access an element not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to review the logic for detecting the type of the key and handle different input types appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "mixed-integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the key is not list-like by converting it to a list. We then properly check for integer or mixed-integer types and use `loc` or `iloc` accordingly. For other types, we simply reindex the Series with the given key.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases.

Please note that the code for `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` functions has been ignored as per the instructions. If there are related issues with those functions as well, they should be reviewed and addressed as needed.
