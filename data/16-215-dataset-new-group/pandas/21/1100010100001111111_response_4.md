The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently than other types of indexers in the `ser` Series. Given the runtime and expected values, it seems that the function is not handling list indexers properly, which causes the KeyError when using `ser.loc[key]`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other types
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list indexers in the same way as other types, we can ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, resolving the issue of KeyError when using `ser.loc[key]` with list indexers.
