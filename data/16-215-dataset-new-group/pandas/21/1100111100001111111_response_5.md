The issue described on GitHub is related to the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. It points out that list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers when used on a Series, leading to inconsistent behavior and KeyError exceptions.

The buggy function `_get_with` is part of this inconsistency, where list-like key inputs are not handled properly. The function is intended to handle different types of keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and different types of Index and Series objects. However, the handling of list-like keys is causing inconsistencies and errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to appropriately handle list-like keys to provide consistent behavior and prevent KeyError exceptions, aligning the behavior with the other types of indexers, and addressing the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a try-except block is used to attempt retrieving the key using `self.loc[key]`, and if it raises a KeyError, it falls back to `self.reindex(key)`. This approach ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently and in alignment with other types of indexers, addressing the inconsistencies and errors reported in the GitHub issue.
