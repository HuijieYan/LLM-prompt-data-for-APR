Based on the information provided, the issue with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it mishandles the key input of type list or ndarray. The function is incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'string'` when it should be inferring it as `'integer'`, leading to the wrong conditional path being taken and causing a KeyError to be raised in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic for the key_type check needs to be adjusted, as well as the handling of different input types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Adjusted conditional logic for key_type
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "mixed-integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle other types of keys
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
