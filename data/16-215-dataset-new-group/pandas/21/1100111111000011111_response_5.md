## The cause of the bug
The buggy `_get_with` function is not handling the case of a list-like key properly. It is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies and raising errors for the list case. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior and is mentioned in the GitHub issue as well.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like key indexers consistently with array-like indexers. This will involve updating the logic for handling different types of keys and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all cases.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            if key.is_bool():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version of the function, we handle scalar keys using `loc`, ensure consistent behavior for boolean keys, and use `ensure_index` to handle list-like keys to avoid inconsistencies. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and provide the expected behavior for all types of keys.
