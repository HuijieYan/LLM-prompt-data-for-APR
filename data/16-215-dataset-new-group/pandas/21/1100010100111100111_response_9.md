The issue seems to be associated with the behavior of list indexers in the pandas Series. The function `_get_with` is not appropriately handling the indexing for list-like inputs, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like inputs. This inconsistency is causing the failing tests to raise a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling list-like inputs when trying to access elements from the Series. The check for list-like inputs and the subsequent indexing logic is not accurately distinguishing between array-like and list-like inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like inputs are handled consistently with array-like inputs in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now handles list-like inputs consistently with other array-like inputs, ensuring that the behavior is the same for various types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and address the failing tests and the related GitHub issue.
