The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in different behaviors when using list vs array-like indexers. As a result, the function may raise a KeyError or fail to return the expected result when using list indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the function to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # New code to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        if np.any(key.inferred_type in ('string', 'integer')):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # remaining code as is...
}
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional block to handle cases where the `key` is an instance of `Index` and not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `Series`. We check for the `inferred_type` of the `key` and return the appropriate result based on its type. This change ensures that list indexers and array-like indexers are handled consistently, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
