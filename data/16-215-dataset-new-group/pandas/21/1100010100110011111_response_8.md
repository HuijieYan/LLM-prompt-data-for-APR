The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Pandas Series. However, the bug occurs when using a list indexer, which is treated differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior.

The expected input for the failing test is a Series object `ser` containing values ["A", "B"] and a key `key` containing the value ["C"]. The bug seems to occur when trying to access an element in the Series using this key, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers, to have the same behavior in all cases as stated in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean", "mixed"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the inconsistent behavior of list indexers versus array-like indexers should be resolved, and it should pass all test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix addresses the issue raised on GitHub by ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers in a Pandas Series.
