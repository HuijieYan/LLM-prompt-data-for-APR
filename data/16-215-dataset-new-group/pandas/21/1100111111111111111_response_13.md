The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because it treats list indexers differently from other indexers. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub thread.

This correction addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and should pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
