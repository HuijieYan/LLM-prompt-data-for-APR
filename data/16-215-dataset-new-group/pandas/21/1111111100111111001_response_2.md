The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the improper handling of the `key_type` variable. It seems to always evaluate to `'string'`, regardless of the type of input `key`, which results in the incorrect execution of the subsequent code depending on this variable.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the type of the `key` input parameter and determine its `key_type` accordingly, ensuring that the subsequent operations in the function are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = None

    if key_type == "integer" or isinstance(key, Integer):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle the `key` type and set the `key_type` variable accordingly. We also handle the case where `key` is a scalar value and perform the appropriate operations based on its type. Additionally, we handle the case when the `key` type is an integer or an instance of the `Integer` class, determining whether to use label-based or positional indexing.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle different input types and execute the appropriate block of code based on the type of `key`, thus passing the failing tests and satisfying all expected input/output values.
