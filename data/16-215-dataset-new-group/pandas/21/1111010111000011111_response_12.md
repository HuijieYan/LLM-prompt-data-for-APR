The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError in certain cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers, including list indexers, and to handle them the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed-integer"):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function handles all types of indexers consistently and should pass the failing test provided. It also aligns with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue description.
