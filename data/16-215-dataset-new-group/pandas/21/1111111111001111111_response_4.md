Based on the information provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the handling of different types of indexers. The bug causes inconsistencies in the behavior of the function when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

Based on the test cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `_get_with` function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access non-matching values. The issue seems to be related to the handling of list indexers and array-like indexers in the function.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers. This involves modifying the conditional branches for handling different types of key input to ensure that list indexers are treated in the same way as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function includes additional checks to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers. This includes converting a Series type key to its values, inferring the key type, and then deciding whether to treat it as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer.

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in a consistent manner, resolving the KeyError issue and ensuring that the function behaves as expected with different types of indexers. This correction aligns with the expectations and types of variables during the failing test execution, as well as the GitHub issue description.
