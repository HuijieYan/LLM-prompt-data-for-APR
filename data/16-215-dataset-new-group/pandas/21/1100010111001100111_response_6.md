The issue in the provided function is due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function does not handle the list indexer case in the same way it handles other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError in certain scenarios.

The key issue is that when a list indexer is used, the function should behave consistently with other array-like indexers, but currently, it does not.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list indexer in the same way it handles other array-like indexers. This will involve modifying the conditional logic to properly handle list indexers and ensure consistency across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key): # use isinstance(key, str) instead?
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle list indexers in the same way it handles other array-like indexers, ensuring consistency and eliminating the KeyError issue. This fix should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as expected.
