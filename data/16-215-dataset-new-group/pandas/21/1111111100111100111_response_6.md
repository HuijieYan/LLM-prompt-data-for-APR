Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, the bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to how different types of indexers are handled. In particular, the case where the indexer is a list is causing an inconsistency and raising a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when trying to access elements in the Series using different types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing the failing tests and the raised `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, and Series) are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function, so that accessing elements in the Series using any of these indexers produces the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle indexers that are not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list for consistency
    key = list(key)

    # Handle different types of indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle indexers that are not list-like separately, and then ensure consistency for handling different types of indexers by treating them in a uniform manner.

This should resolve the inconsistency and address the failing tests, ensuring that accessing elements in the Series using different types of indexers produces the expected behavior.
