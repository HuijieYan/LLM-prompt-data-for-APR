The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the incorrect behavior when using a list indexer. The function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to a KeyError being raised in certain cases.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it checks the type of the `key` parameter and tries to infer its type. The function should correctly handle list indexers in a consistent manner.

The failing test is trying to demonstrate that the behavior is inconsistent when using different types of indexers. It expects the same behavior when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as the key to index the Series. However, the bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError to be raised when using a list key, while the other types of indexers do not result in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to handle the list indexer in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This consistency will align with the expectations of the test and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the function handles the list indexer in a consistent manner and should pass the failing test. It also aligns with the expectations of the input/output values and types for the function.
