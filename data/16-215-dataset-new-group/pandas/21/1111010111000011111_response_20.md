The buggy function `_get_with` has a conditional statement that is not handling the case where the `key` is a list properly. This is causing inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

The cause of the bug is that when the `key` is a list, the function does not handle this case properly and attempts to use `reindex(key)`, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement to handle the case where `key` is a list. We should remove the conversion of `key` to a list within the function and handle it as a list directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case when key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the different types of `key` inputs more consistently and should resolve the KeyError issue raised in the failing test. This corrected function should also satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
