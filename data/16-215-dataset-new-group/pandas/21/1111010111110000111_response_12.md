The bug in the `_get_with` function is that when the `key` is a list, it is not handled properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior with other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug:
1. When the key is a list, it is not correctly handled in the `_get_with` function.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index with a list-like object, which leads to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, str, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame, string, or numpy array is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate Series or index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected `_get_with` function, I added additional checks to handle different types of indexers consistently. When the key is not list-like, it should return the corresponding location value using `self.loc[key]`. If the key is list-like, it should `reindex` based on the key, ensuring consistent behavior for all indexers.

With this correction, the function is expected to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue described in the failing test.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches." The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.
