The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class inside the pandas package is causing an issue when using a list indexer for a Series object. The issue is related to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file raises a KeyError with a specific message: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using a list indexer for a Series object, leading to a KeyError. The GitHub issue further confirms this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior for using list indexers should be aligned with the behavior for array-like indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function can be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The modification ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as array-like indexers, fixing the inconsistency and resolving the issue observed in the failing test.
