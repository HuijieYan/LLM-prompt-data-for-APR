To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when using a list index, whereas other index types do not raise the same error.

The bug is related to how list indexers are handled differently in the `_get_with` function, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug arises from the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, it fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to the KeyError when attempting to return the result.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will help ensure consistent behavior across different index types and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the conditional statements that were causing the inconsistent behavior for list indexers. Now, all index types, including lists, are handled uniformly, and the function should no longer raise a KeyError.

By updating the `_get_with` function with this corrected version, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass.
