The buggy function has several potential error locations:

1. The condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` will always fail because `ABCDataFrame` is a base class for pandas DataFrame and does not represent an instance of a DataFrame. This condition should be changed to `elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):`

2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` is supposed to check if the key is not list-like, but the condition should be worked on since it might not behave as intended.

3. The condition `if key_type == "integer":` is to decide whether to treat the indexer as label-based or positional. This might not work as expected because it doesn't account for Boolean indexing.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle different types of keys and indexers, leading to potential errors or incorrect results, based on the conditions provided.

I suggested strategy for fixing the bug is:
1. Change the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` to `elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):`.
2. Revisit the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` to ensure it accurately checks if the key is list-like.
3. Revise the condition `if key_type == "integer":` to account for Boolean indexing as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer", "mixed-integer-float"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
