The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` variable. The function incorrectly assigns the type of the key as `'string'` in all cases, which leads to incorrect indexing operations. This is why the tests are failing, as the function cannot handle the different types of keys correctly.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to correctly identify the type of the key variable and perform the indexing operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Use loc for label-based indexing
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `self.loc` for label-based indexing and updating the conditional checks, the corrected version of the function should be able to handle different input key types and pass the failing tests.
