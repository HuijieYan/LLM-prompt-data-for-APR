The issue with the buggy function lies in the incorrect identification and handling of the key type, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests. This is due to the misinterpretation of the key type within the function.

To fix the bug, the key type should be accurately identified and utilized. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements and variable assignments based on the actual type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes modifications to accurately identify the key type and handle it accordingly. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases.

If there are other functions within the same class that depend on the correct handling of the key type, they should also be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
