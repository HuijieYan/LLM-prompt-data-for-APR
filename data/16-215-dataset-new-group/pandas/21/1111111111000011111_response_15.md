The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from discrepancies in how different types of indexers are handled, especially when the key is a list. This causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, resulting in a KeyError for the list case and different behavior for other types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, especially for the list case, and address the KeyError that occurs specifically for this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        # Convert the key to a list to ensure consistency
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle all types of indexers consistently
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

```

In the corrected version, we first convert the key to a list to ensure consistent handling regardless of the input type. Then, we check the `key_type` to determine whether to use positional-based indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, and specifically addresses the KeyError issue for the list case as reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
