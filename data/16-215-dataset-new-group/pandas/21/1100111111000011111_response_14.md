The issue in the provided function is that when a list-like key is used to index the series, it results in an inconsistent behavior, raising a KeyError. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers such as pd.Index and np.array.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the list-like key is handled in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = "array"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle list-like key in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers such as pd.Index and np.array, ensuring that the KeyError is not raised. This correction aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided and satisfy the expected input/output values.
