## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.

1. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition might not be handling all possible data types correctly.
2. The `if key_type == "integer"` condition might not be correctly determining whether to treat the key as a positional indexer or label-based indexer.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information.

The bug seems to be related to the way list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers. The failing test cases indicate that the behavior of handling list indexers is inconsistent and might not align with how other indexers are handled. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" also points to an issue with how the indexer is being validated.

The referential function doesn't work as expected and raises a KeyError for list indexers, whereas other types of indexers do not raise an error. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, indicating that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, which is not the expected behavior.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the conditions related to handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior.
2. Validate the indexer correctly to account for all data types.
3. Handle the list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers.

## Provide a corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I've removed the check for non-list-like keys and instead always convert the key to a list if it's not an array-like indexer. This aligns with the behavior for other array-like indexers. Additionally, I've removed the unnecessary conditions related to index types, as the inference should handle validation appropriately. This should resolve the inconsistency in handling list indexers and align the behavior with other types of indexers.
