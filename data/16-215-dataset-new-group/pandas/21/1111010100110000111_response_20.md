Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in the indexing of a Series with list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The bug is occurring in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when indexing with a list that has no matches. It seems that the conditional blocks for handling different types of indexers are not behaving consistently, leading to the unexpected behavior and error messages.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statements to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. Additionally, we need to ensure that the error message being raised is accurate and consistent across all indexer types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we make use of `np.asarray` to ensure consistent handling of list indexers. We then directly call `self.loc[key]` to access the values based on the modified `key` regardless of its type. This approach ensures consistent behavior for indexing with different types of indexers, which should resolve the bug and make the function behavior consistent with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
