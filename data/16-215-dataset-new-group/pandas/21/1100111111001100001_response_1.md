The issue with the buggy function lies in the logic used to determine the type of the 'key' input. It is incorrectly identified as a 'string' type, regardless of its actual type, causing the function to behave incorrectly and fail the test. The function should accurately identify the type of 'key' to proceed with the appropriate logic.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to accurately determine the type of 'key' and handle different types appropriately. This can be achieved by using Python's built-in isinstance function to determine the type of 'key' and then apply the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
      
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
                
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the function now accurately identifies the type of 'key' and applies the corresponding logic, addressing the bug and ensuring that the failing tests pass.
