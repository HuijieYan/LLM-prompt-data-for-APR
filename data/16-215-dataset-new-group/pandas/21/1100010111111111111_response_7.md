The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle the case when indexing a Series with a list-like object containing no matches. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised in this scenario, contrary to the behavior when indexing with other types of objects.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when indexing with a list-like object that contains no matches in the index. This causes inconsistent behavior compared to indexing with other types of objects.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the case of indexing with a list-like object that has no matches in the index. This should ensure that the behavior is consistent with other indexing scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if len(key) == 0 or all(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    # Rest of the original function remains unchanged
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # ... (remaining code)

```

With this fix, the function should handle the case of indexing with a list-like object containing no matches in the index, and raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This solution addresses the issue reported on GitHub and provides a consistent behavior for indexing with list-like objects.
