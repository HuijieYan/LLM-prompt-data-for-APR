The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has several potential error locations. The function has a series of conditional statements to handle different types of input for the `key` parameter. The bug is likely related to the conditional checks and how the function processes the input values.

The input types for the `key` parameter include list, slice, DataFrame, tuple, and scalars that aren't recognized as list-like. The function then identifies the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter and performs different operations based on this type. The bug is likely related to the incorrect identification of the `key_type` and the subsequent operations based on this identification.

Given the runtime values and types provided for the input parameters and relevant variables, it appears that the `key_type` value is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all the cases, regardless of the actual type of `key`. This suggests that the conditional checks and type identification in the function are not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and type identification logic in the function `_get_with` need to be revised to accurately identify the type of the `key` parameter. Once the type is correctly identified, the function should perform operations based on the type of the `key` parameter to ensure that the correct functionality is applied for each input type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for identifying the `key_type` has been revised to accurately handle different input types for the `key` parameter. Additionally, the conditional checks have been updated to align with the correct type identification and to perform the corresponding operations based on the identified type.
