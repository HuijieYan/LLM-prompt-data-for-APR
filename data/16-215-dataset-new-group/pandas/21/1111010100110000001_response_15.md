The issue in the provided function is that an incorrect type is being used to validate the key in the `if` condition. This results in a `TypeError` when attempting to handle the key. 

The error message states that `None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]`, which suggests that the problem is caused by incorrect handling of the key in the Series. The tests related to indexing a Series using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series indicate that the current definition of `_get_with` is not handling the key correctly, leading to a failed `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the type of the key being used and handle it appropriately, ensuring that errors are properly caught and raised to provide a meaningful response. Since the error message suggests that the list-like keys are not being handled correctly, an appropriate action needs to be taken in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function.

```python
# The corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, instead of using `not is_list_like(key)`, `is_scalar(key)` is used to identify non-list_like keys. Then, a separate condition is added to handle scalar (non-list_like) keys. This is necessary because scalars need to be managed differently from list-like keys. 

The final corrected function ensures that the correct type and nature of the keys are identified, and it properly handles and returns the requested values based on the type of key provided.
