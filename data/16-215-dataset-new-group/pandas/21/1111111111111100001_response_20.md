## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_get_with` function is supposed to handle different types of key inputs for the `Series` class. It checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object, and acts accordingly. However, there are issues with how it handles different key types.

### Issues and Causes
1. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as "string" for all cases. This indicates that the key type is not being correctly determined, leading to incorrect processing of the key.

2. The function incorrectly treats all key types as "string", leading to inappropriate indexing or reindexing operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the issue, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly determined and processed accordingly within the function. We should also handle different key types appropriately to prevent errors.

### Fixing the Bug
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key) # Convert to Index if not already

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
In the fixed version:
1. We use `ensure_index` to ensure that the key is converted to an Index if it is not already one. This allows us to determine the key type correctly and perform appropriate operations.
2. We update the type checks to handle the key appropriately based on its type, ensuring that the correct indexing or reindexing operations are performed.
