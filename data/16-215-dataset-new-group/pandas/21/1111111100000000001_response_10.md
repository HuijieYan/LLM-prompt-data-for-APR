The buggy function `_get_with` checks the type of `key` to determine how to retrieve values from a Series. It contains a conditional block to handle different key types. However, it is possible that a condition in the conditional block is not being met, causing the function to execute the last `return self.reindex(key)`. This implies that it's not able to identify the appropriate logic for handling the key provided. Thus, there seem to be multiple causes of the bug based on the function's logic for handling different key types.

We need to ensure that the logic of the function properly handles various key types and their corresponding operations. It is also important to check if the function is handling exceptional cases effectively.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the key is of type `slice` and then handles that case using relevant logic. Then it checks if the key is of type `tuple` or `ABCDataFrame`. Afterwards, there's a check for a boolean key type and all other types of keys are directed to the `loc` method for indexing. This approach aims to ensure that all key types are handled effectively and the logic is clearer.
