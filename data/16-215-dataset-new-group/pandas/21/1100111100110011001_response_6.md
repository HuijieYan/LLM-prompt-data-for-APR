The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely causing an issue with the indexing of a Series. The function appears to be trying to handle different types of inputs for the `key` parameter, but it is not returning the expected results.

The issue seems to be related to the determination of the `key_type` and how it is used to decide whether to treat the indexing as positional or label-based.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the different types of inputs for `key` and accurately determine the `key_type` to ensure that the correct indexing method is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):

    # ... (other function definitions)

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key, **kwargs)  # Pass along **kwargs to reindex
``` 

This corrected in the `_get_with` function should now resolve the issues with the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
