The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the incorrect inference of the `key_type` variable, which leads to the wrong execution path being taken in the function. The key_type is inferred based on the type of the key passed to the function, but the inference logic appears to be flawed.

To fix the bug, the inference logic for the `key_type` variable should be reviewed and corrected to accurately identify the type of key being used. Additionally, the subsequent conditional blocks in the function should be modified based on the corrected type inference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "list":
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type inference logic has been modified to handle different types of input keys, and the subsequent conditional blocks have been adjusted based on the corrected type of key being identified. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
