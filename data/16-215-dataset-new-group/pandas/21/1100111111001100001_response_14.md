- The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic for handling different types of keys in the `_get_with` function.
- The function has different conditionals to handle different types of keys, but the logic inside those conditionals seems to be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for handling different types of keys and update the return statements based on the type of key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # convert single value to list for further processing

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        if isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
            key = key.values
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised logic should address the issues encountered with the previous implementation and should now correctly handle different types of keys.
