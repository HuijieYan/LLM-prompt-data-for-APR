The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the failing tests. The function is not handling the input types correctly, leading to different behaviors for list, array-like, and Index input types. The function should be revised to handle the different input types consistently and align with the expected behavior.

The bug seems to be in the way the function is handling different types of input. It should handle all types consistently and produce the expected behavior for each input type, as well as correctly handle the KeyError.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent handling of different input types (list, array-like, and Index) and align with the expected behavior for each input type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the different input types consistently and align with the expected behavior, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
