In the corrected version, several changes have been made to handle different input types for the `key` parameter. These changes include adding additional `elif` statements to handle specific index classes and modifying the existing `if` statement to handle another specific index class. This should resolve the issues encountered during testing and ensure that the function returns the expected results for different input types.
