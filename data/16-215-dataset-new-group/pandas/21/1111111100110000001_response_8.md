The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the key parameter correctly. This results in a `KeyError` exception when the Series is indexed with a box of type `Index`. The function is not properly distinguishing between different types of keys, such as `Index`, `Series`, and other array-like objects such as lists or ndarrays.

One strategy to fix this bug is to explicitly handle the case when the key is an instance of `Index`. In this case, we can simply access the elements on the Series directly using the `loc` attribute. Additionally, we should handle the case when the key is a Series, as it should be treated similarly to a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            # simply access the elements directly using loc
            return self.loc[key]
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version should handle the different types of keys and resolve the `KeyError` exception that was previously raised.
