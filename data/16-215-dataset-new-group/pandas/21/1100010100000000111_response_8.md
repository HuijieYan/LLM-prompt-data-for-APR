The bug in the function _get_with is due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing the function to raise errors for list indexers.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers. This can be achieved by implementing a check to validate the indexer type and then handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (abc.Series, abc.Index, np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is an instance of abc.Series, abc.Index, np.ndarray, or list. If it matches any of these types, we directly use self.loc[key] to handle the indexer consistently. Otherwise, we assume it is a slice and proceed with the slice handling code.

This fix ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
