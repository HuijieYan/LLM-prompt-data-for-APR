The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it incorrectly handles the situation when the key is neither a slice nor a tuple, and is not list-like. In this case, the function calls `self.loc[key]`, which should be valid behavior, but it doesn't handle certain types of key correctly.

The bug also arises for cases where the key is an instance of a pandas Index class. The code doesn't handle this situation correctly and can result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should first handle the different cases for key types to ensure that the correct operation is performed depending on the type of the key. Then, we have to ensure that the behavior of the function aligns with the intended use of the `loc` and `iloc` operators.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # If the key is neither a slice nor a tuple, handle it accordingly
    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list) and (
            (not is_extension_array_dtype(key) and not is_object_dtype(key)) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries)
        ):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function handles the different key types and responds appropriately to the input, ensuring that it aligns with the intended behavior of the `loc` and `iloc` operators.
