Based on the analysis, the cause of the bug seems to be in the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. The bug leads to a KeyError when using the list indexer.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers. This will resolve the inconsistency and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the key is first checked for specific types (slice, DataFrame, tuple, array-like) and handled accordingly. If the key is an array-like type, it is directly used to reindex the series. If it is not array-like, it is converted to an Index using `ensure_index` and then the key type is inferred and processed further.

This corrected version should resolve the inconsistent behavior and prevent the KeyError from occurring, matching the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
