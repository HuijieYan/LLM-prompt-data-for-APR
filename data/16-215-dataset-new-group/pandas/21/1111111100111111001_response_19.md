The issue seems to be in the key_type variable, which should be inferred from the input key. However, it seems that the logic to infer the type of the key is not working correctly, as it always returns `'string'` regardless of the actual type of key being passed.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly infer the type of the key based on its input type. We can achieve this by using Python's builtin function `type()` to check the type of the key and then set the `key_type` based on that.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    ...
    key_type = type(key)
    if key_type is slice:
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif key_type is ABCDataFrame:
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif key_type is tuple:
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # The logic to handle the type-specific actions (integer, boolean etc.) based on key_type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first determine the `key_type` by using `type(key)`. Then, we update the logic to handle the different types of `key` based on its inferred type. Additionally, the logic for other type-specific actions (integer, boolean etc.) should be updated based on the `key_type`.
