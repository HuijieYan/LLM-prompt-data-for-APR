The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the test to fail. The issue seems to be related to how different indexers are treated, specifically the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`.

The key issue seems to be in the section that handles non-list-like key types. It is likely that the function is not handling the list-like key properly, leading to the KeyError.

The bug likely arises from not handling the list-like key properly, especially when it is being used to index the Series. This is evident from the different behavior observed when using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the list-like key and ensure that it behaves consistently with other indexers. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic for handling list-like keys and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a conditional check for list-like keys at the beginning of the function. If the key is list-like, it will use `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing. This should ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
