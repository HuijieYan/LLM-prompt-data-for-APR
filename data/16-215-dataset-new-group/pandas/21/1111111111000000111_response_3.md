The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list, which is inconsistent with the behavior when the key is an array-like indexer. This inconsistency is the cause of the bug, as highlighted in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the key is a list in a similar way to the array-like indexer. This will ensure consistent behavior and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where the key is a list
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the case where the key is a list by using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent behavior. This should resolve the inconsistency and make the function behave as expected.
