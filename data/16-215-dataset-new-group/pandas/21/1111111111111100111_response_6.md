The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case when a list indexer is passed, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. When a list indexer is passed, the function is unable to handle it correctly, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, to maintain consistency in behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string', 'mixed-integer']:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like indexers, which should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
