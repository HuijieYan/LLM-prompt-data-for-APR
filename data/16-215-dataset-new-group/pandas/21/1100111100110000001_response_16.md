The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be encountering an issue when a KeyError is expected, but not raised. Based on the error message, the failing test is being caused by different input types `box` such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The failure points to the call to `ser[key]` syntax inside the test.

The bug is likely originating because the `_get_with` function is not correctly handling different input types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly handles the different input types such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        # Handle Series and Index types
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # Handle list and numpy array types
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Handle other types, like scalars and tuples
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks the type of the `key` and handles each type accordingly using the `loc` and `reindex` methods. This should address the issue and make the test pass.
