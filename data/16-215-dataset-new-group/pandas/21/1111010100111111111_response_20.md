The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in how different indexers are being treated, leading to failing tests. The function is not handling indexers of type `list` correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to access a non-existent key.

The issue is related to how list indexers are being treated differently from other array-like indexers. This is causing inconsistencies in behavior and test failures.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the `list` type indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This would involve making all indexers behave like the `list` case, which should align with the expected behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected implementation, all indexers will behave consistently, resolving the inconsistencies and the failing tests. This fix aligns with the expected behavior for different types of indexers and addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
