The issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically with list indexers. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, the function is raising a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected result.

The potential error location seems to be in the logic that handles list-like indexers. The function is not treating list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, which is causing the `KeyError`. This can be seen from the failing tests, where using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` all return the expected result, but `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when it should be returning the expected result. This inconsistency is also mentioned in the GitHub issue, indicating that the behavior of list indexers differs from other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior and avoid raising `KeyError` in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):  # Handle list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
        
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Code for handling integer and other cases remains unchanged
    # ...

    return self.reindex(key)
```
By checking if the `key` is list-like and returning `self.loc[key]`, we ensure that list indexers are treated the same as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.
