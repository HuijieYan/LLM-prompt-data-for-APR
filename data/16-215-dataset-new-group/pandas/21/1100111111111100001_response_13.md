The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to an incorrect type being assigned to the `key_type` variable. This affects the conditional branching in the function and might lead to errors when indexing the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct type is assigned to the `key_type` variable. We can do this by adjusting the logic for determining the type of the `key`. 

Additionally, we can simplify the logic for handling different types of `key`, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported")
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:  # Handle other types
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should operate correctly and pass the failing tests.
