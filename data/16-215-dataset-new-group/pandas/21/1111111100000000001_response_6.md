The buggy function `_get_with` contains multiple conditional checks for the type of `key` and returns different results based on the type. The potential error locations are in the conditional checks and the inference of the data type of `key`.

The cause of the bug could be the mishandling of the type checking when processing the `key`. There might be scenarios where the type of `key` is not getting correctly handled due to which an incorrect method is getting called.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional checks based on the correct handling of different types of `key` and ensure that the correct methods are called based on that.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
1. We handle scalar key using `is_scalar` to correctly call `self.loc[key]`.
2. We convert `key` to an Index using `ensure_index` for list-like keys.
3. We infer the data type of `key` and use that to determine whether to use `self.iloc` or `self.loc` based on the key's type.
4. We simplify the logic to directly call `self.loc` or `self.iloc` based on the type of `key`.

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function will handle different types of `key` correctly and ensure that the appropriate method is called based on the type of `key`.
