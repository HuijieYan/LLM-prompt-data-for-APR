Potential error locations:
1. The conditional check for `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` could be causing the issue.
2. The handling of key as a list may be incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing Series data using different types of indexers. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which points out the inconsistency in behavior for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional checks for different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior for all types.
2. Verify the handling of key as a list and ensure it aligns with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
3. Test the fix against the example provided in the GitHub issue to verify consistent and correct behavior.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series) or isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the conditional checks for different types of indexers have been simplified to ensure consistent behavior. The key is treated as a list or array-like indexer, and the handling of position-based and label-based indexing is also improved to provide a consistent and correct result. This should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
