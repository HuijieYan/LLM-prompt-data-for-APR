In the given buggy function, an error occurs when the 'keys' variable contains a list ('x') instead of a scalar value ('x') in the failing test case.

The cause of the bug is that the 'keys' variable is supposed to receive a scalar value but is sometimes being provided with a list by the function call, which causes the subsequent broadcast operations to fail.

To fix this bug, update the buggy function to determine if 'key' is a list instead of a Scalar. If it is a list, convert the elements of the list into a scalar using the first element of that list. This will ensure data consistency in the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... [the remaining code]

    # if the actual grouper should be obj[key]
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            try:
                obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
            except Exception:
                return False
        return True

    # ... [the remaining code]

    # Updated section that fixes the bug
    if not is_scalar(key):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... [the remaining code]

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):

        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)

        elif is_in_axis(gpr):  # df.groupby('name')
            if gpr in obj:
                if validate:
                    obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
                in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
                exclusions.append(name)
            elif obj._is_level_reference(gpr):
                in_axis, name, level, gpr = False, None, gpr, None
            else:
                raise KeyError(gpr)  # Remove if it is not a good condition for your business logic

    # ... [the remaining code]

```

In this corrected version, the function checks whether 'key' is a scalar or a list. If 'key' is not a scalar, it is converted to a list containing only the element 'key'. This ensures that the rest of the function can properly handle the input 'key' and prevents the failure observed in the failing test cases.

This correction should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
