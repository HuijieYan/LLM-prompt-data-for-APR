The bug in the function seems to be related to the processing of the 'key' and 'level' parameters. Specifically, there are conditions and logic related to the type and value of 'key' and 'level' that seem to be causing issues.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review and refactor the conditions and logic related to the 'key' and 'level' parameters. This may involve simplifying the conditions, ensuring consistent handling of data types, and addressing any potential edge cases that may lead to unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # ... (existing code)
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # ... (existing code)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            key = list(key)
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if not any_arraylike and match_axis_length and level is None:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
                )
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuples(keys)]

        if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
            if key is None:
                keys = [None] * len(level)
            levels = level
        else:
            levels = [level] * len(keys)

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
            # ... (existing code)

    # ... (existing code)
```

This corrected version revises the handling of 'key' and 'level' parameters, addressing potential issues related to data types and edge cases. It also borrows the existing code to handle other components of the function.

Please note that this correction is based on the provided expected cases and should be further validated based on additional tests.
