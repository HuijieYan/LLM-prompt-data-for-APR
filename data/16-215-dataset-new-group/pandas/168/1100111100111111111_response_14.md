The issue appears to be related to a bug where `groupby()` with `axis=1` does not offer implicit selection by column name(s). This is causing a KeyError when attempting to group by columns on the "x" column label. The expected behavior is to group by columns, but instead, a KeyError is raised.

To resolve this issue, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function needs to be fixed in the pandas library. The buggy function is not correctly handling the grouping by columns, which is causing the KeyError. By analyzing the failing cases and their expected outputs, a correction can be made to address this issue.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    elif axis == 1 and not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    elif axis == 0:
        key = key

    groupings = []
  
    for column in key:
        if column in group_axis:
            gpr = obj[column]
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    level=None,
                    name=column,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function includes specific logic to handle grouping by columns when `axis=1`. It correctly checks whether the key is list-like and then processes the groupings accordingly. This fix should address the KeyError and ensure that the function behaves as expected, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
