The issue with the provided `_get_grouper` function is that it is not handling the case where `key` is a list. When `key` is a list, the function should treat each element in the list as a Grouper to create the groupings. To fix the bug, we need to update the function such that it handles a list of groupers appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for gpr in key:
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=None,
                    level=None,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                ) if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping) else gpr
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(None)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # handle the non-list case as before
    # ...
}
```

With this corrected version of the function, a list of groupers passed as `key` will be correctly handled in the function to create groupings, allowing the function to handle the failing tests appropriately.
