The issue with the buggy function lies within the logic for determining how to handle the grouping of columns based on the input parameters. The GitHub issue reported that `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` raises a `KeyError` even though "x" is a column name.

The buggy function contains a complex logic for handling the grouping based on the input parameters, including level, key, and axis. The cause of the bug is related to the handling of the "key" parameter, which determines the grouping. It fails to correctly handle the case when grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the "key" parameter and determining the grouping by columns needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should correctly identify when the "key" parameter refers to columns and group accordingly, instead of raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Check if the grouping is by columns
    if key is not None and axis == 1:
        if is_list_like(key):
            # Group by multiple columns
            keys = key
        else:
            keys = [key]
        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[key],
                obj=obj,
                name=key,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            for key in keys
        ]
        
        # Create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        
        return grouper, [], obj

    # Continue with the original logic for index grouping
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the grouping is by columns when the "key" parameter is provided and the axis is 1. If so, it creates the groupings based on the column keys and returns the grouper accordingly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
