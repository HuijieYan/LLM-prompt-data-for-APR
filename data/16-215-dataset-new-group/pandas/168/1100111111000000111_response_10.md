The issue seems to be related to the `groupby` function not working as expected when grouping along columns using the `axis=1` parameter. The failing test provided tries to perform a groupby operation on the columns of a DataFrame, but it raises a KeyError even though the column name is specified correctly.

The issue is likely due to the `_get_grouper` function not handling column names properly when performing the grouping operation. The code that identifies the level and key for grouping may be causing the problem when the grouping is done along the columns.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping along the columns using the `axis=1` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        # Grouping along columns
        if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list) and all(k in obj.columns for k in key):
            key = obj[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the grouping is done along the columns by checking if the key is a string or a list of strings representing column names, and then getting the corresponding column(s) from the DataFrame.

This modification should ensure that the `_get_grouper` function correctly handles grouping along the columns, allowing the failing test to pass and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
