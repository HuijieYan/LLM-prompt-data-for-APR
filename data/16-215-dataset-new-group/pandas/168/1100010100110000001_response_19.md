The issue occurs when using a list as the input for the `group_name` parameter in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` call. The `groupby` function raises a `KeyError` when trying to create the BaseGrouper in the `_get_grouper` function. The issue seems to stem from handling the case where `group_name` is a list.

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function include the handling of `group_axis`, `level`, `key`, and creating the BaseGrouper.

In the `_get_grouper` function, the issue appears to be related to the assumption of `key` as a single value rather than a list of keys when the input is a list. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to create the BaseGrouper.

A strategy for fixing the bug involves checking the type of `key` and handling the case where it is a list differently to avoid the `KeyError` when creating the BaseGrouper.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        # Loop through multiple keys if key is a list
        for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
            # Your existing logic for handling different gpr scenarios here...

            # create the Grouping for each key in the list
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=gpr,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,  # Assuming all keys in the list are in the axis
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        # Rest of the existing code for creating BaseGrouper...
    else:
        # Existing logic for handling single key...

    # Existing code for returning the grouper
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function adds a check for whether `key` is a list. If it is a list, it iterates through each key and creates a Grouping for each one, then continues with the existing logic for creating the BaseGrouper. This modification should resolve the KeyError when handling a list of keys.
