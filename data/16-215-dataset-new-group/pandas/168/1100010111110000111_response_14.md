The buggy function `_get_grouper` is causing a KeyError when attempting to group by column names using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This issue is related to the handling of the `key` parameter within the `_get_grouper` function.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling the case where `key` is a list of column names correctly. When `key` is a list, the function is not correctly identifying the columns for grouping, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic around handling the `key` parameter when it is a list of column names. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the columns for grouping when `key` is a list, and also handles the case of grouping by column names using the `axis=1` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        # If the key is a single string, convert it to a list with one element
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the case where key is a list of column names for grouping
        keys = key  # Now keys is a list of column names
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == group_axis.nlevels

        # Create the groupings for each column name in the keys list
        groupings = []
        for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=None,  # For grouping by columns, level is None
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,  # It's in axis as it is a column name
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        # Create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the `_get_grouper` function correctly handles the case where `key` is a list of column names for grouping. It creates the necessary groupings for each column name and returns the BaseGrouper for grouping by columns.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub link.
