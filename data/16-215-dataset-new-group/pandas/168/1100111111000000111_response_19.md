The buggy function is intended to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It handles different cases for creating groupers based on the input parameters. One of the identified issues is in the section where the function checks if the level provided is compatible with the passed axis of the object. There are conditional statements for handling MultiIndex instances and non-MultiIndex instances, but these blocks are almost the same, causing redundancy.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when grouping along the columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError even though the intent is to group by the columns based on the provided column name.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1` is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Other parts of the function are omitted for brevity

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]  # Extract the column by name for grouping along columns

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is added specifically for `axis=1` and when the `key` is a string, which denotes grouping along the columns. In this case, the column is extracted from the object `obj` to be used for grouping.

With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the grouping by columns when called with `axis=1` and a column name, resolving the issue where a KeyError was being raised when attempting to group along the columns.
