The issue with the `_get_grouper` function comes from the condition where a tuple key is being interpreted as a list of keys, rather than a single key. This leads to the error because 'x' is being iterated over as a list. 

Instead of checking the type of `key` and then converting it to a list if it's a tuple, we should consistently treat it as a list, except when a Grouper or BaseGrouper is passed in.

Here's the corrected `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    if isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)):
        return key, [], obj
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    keys = key
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Rest of the function body
    # ...
```

By changing the conversion to a list to handle the case consistently for all key types, the issue related to erroneous iterations over 'x' will be resolved. This correction should be sufficient to pass the failing test cases.
