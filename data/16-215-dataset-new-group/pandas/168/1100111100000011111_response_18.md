## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. The function is unable to properly handle the column names and throws a KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the logic for handling column names and ensure that it properly distinguishes between index and column names.
2. Verify that the function correctly identifies the group axis and is able to handle the axis parameter when grouping by columns.
3. Ensure that the process for creating Groupings for grouping by columns is functioning correctly.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    """
    if axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj.T._get_axis(0)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

By adding the condition `if axis == 1`, we are able to handle the axis parameter correctly by transposing the dataframe and then getting the axis. This way, the function will correctly handle grouping by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`.
