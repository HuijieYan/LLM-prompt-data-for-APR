The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when the `axis` parameter is set to 1 (indicating column-wise grouping). The bug results in a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column names, as reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function tries to interpret the `key` parameter, especially when `axis` is set to 1. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` is a list of column names, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `key` parameter for column-wise grouping. This may involve checking if the `key` parameter is a list and iterating over the column names to create the appropriate groupings. Additionally, the handling of the `level` parameter and the associated validation may need to be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the intention of column-wise grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.columns.name != level:  # Check column name instead of index name
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                )
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        level = None
        key = obj.columns

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr in keys:
        if gpr in group_axis:
            in_axis, name = True, gpr
            exclusions.append(name)

            # create the Grouping
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=name,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=in_axis,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly handles the case where the `key` parameter is a list of column names, creates groupings based on the column names, and returns the appropriate grouper for column-wise grouping.

This corrected version should resolve the KeyError issue when grouping by column names and pass the failing test. It aligns with the intention of grouping by columns and should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
