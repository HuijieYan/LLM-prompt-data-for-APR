The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns on the `axis=1`. The problem is that the function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list of strings for column names.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the `key` parameter when it is a list of strings for column names. The function does not correctly process the list of column names and raises a KeyError when attempting to group by columns on `axis=1`.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `key` parameter for column names needs to be updated to properly support the case when it is a list of strings for column names.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing implementation)

    # new handling for column names when 'key' is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if match_axis_length and level is None:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns for g in keys
                )
            else:
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if all_in_columns_index:
                # create a list of groupings for each column name in keys
                groupings = [
                    Grouping(
                        group_axis,
                        obj[g],
                        obj=obj,
                        name=g,
                        level=level,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                    for g in keys
                ]
                grouper = BaseGrouper(
                    group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated
                )
                return grouper, [], obj
```

The updated code checks if the `key` parameter is a list, and if so, it iterates over the list of column names and creates a list of groupings for each column name. Then, it creates a `BaseGrouper` and returns the groupings along with the grouper and the input object.

This modification should fix the bug by correctly handling the case when `key` is a list of column names for grouping by columns on `axis=1`. This change should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to grouping by columns not working as expected.
