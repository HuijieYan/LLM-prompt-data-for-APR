```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, str):  # Check if key is a string, indicating a column name
        if axis == 1 and key in obj:  # Ensure key exists in dataframe's columns
            group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)
            key = group_axis.get_loc(key)  # Get the location of the key
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, (int, list)):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list

    # No changes made to the rest of the function...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
In the corrected version of the function, a check is added to determine if the `key` input is a string and if the `axis` is set to 1. If both conditions are met, it checks if the `key` exists in the dataframe's columns. If it does, the function updates the `key` by getting its location in the columns and sets the `level` to `None`. If the `key` is an integer or a list, it is converted to a list for consistency.

This correction addresses the issue of the `KeyError` raised when grouping along columns with the column name as the key. Now, the corrected function should correctly handle column name grouping and produce the expected output.
