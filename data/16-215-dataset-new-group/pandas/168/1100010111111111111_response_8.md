The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to properly handle the input parameters when the `key` is a single-element list. It results in a `KeyError` when attempting to group by columns name(s).

The bug causes the function to treat the `key` as a list of keys rather than a single key when it's not in the index. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior of grouping by the column name.

To fix the bug, the function needs to recognize when the `key` is a single-element list and handle it appropriately to group by the specified column name.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (pre-existing code)

    # a tuple key will always mean an actual key, not an iterable of keys.
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if not all(is_hashable(k) for k in key):
            keys = list(key)
        else:
            keys = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        keys = key
    elif is_scalar(key) or key is None:
        keys = [key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid 'key' type")

    # ... (continuation of pre-existing code)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by explicitly handling the case where the `key` is a single-element list, ensuring that the function can properly handle the input and group by the specified column name.
