## The corrected function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if is_list_like(key):
        # if the passed-in Grouper is a list of keys,
        # convert it to a single key representing the list
        if len(key) > 1:
            key = com.asarray_tuplesafe(key)
        else:
            key = key[0]

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):

        if key is not None and is_scalar(key):

        level = None

        # handle the level parameter as a string
        if obj.index.name != level:
            raise ValueError(
                "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
            )
        level = None
        key = group_axis
    elif level is not None and (level > 0 or level < -1):
        raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # create the BaseGrouper using the resolved key and level
    grouper = BaseGrouper(
        group_axis,
        [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)],
        sort=sort,
        mutated=mutated,
    )

    return grouper, [], obj
```

With this corrected function, the provided test cases should pass and the behavior of the `groupby` operation on columns should align with expectations.
