The bug in the provided function seems to be due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The `key` parameter should be processed correctly based on its data type. It should be treated differently when it is a single value or a list of values.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Make sure to handle the `key` parameter appropriately based on its type: string, list, or Grouper.
2. Modify the if-else blocks to handle the case where the `key` is a list, ensuring that it correctly checks for its length and processes it accordingly.
3. Update the `keys` variable to handle both single values and lists appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # New function code
    if key is None:
        keys = [None]
        match_axis_length = False
    elif isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    else:
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            keys = list(key)
        elif not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Process the keys and create groupings
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # ... (existing code)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The revised code checks for the data type of the `key` parameter and handles it appropriately, ensuring that it creates the groupings correctly based on the key's type. Additionally, it removes redundant code and reduces the complexity of the conditions.

It is recommended to test the updated function with various input cases to ensure its correctness.
