The issue is related to the `groupby` function not correctly grouping along columns when using the `axis=1` parameter. The function doesn't recognize the columns when passed as the `by` parameter, causing a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `_get_grouper` function processes and validates the input parameters, particularly when dealing with the columns as the `by` parameter. The function fails to correctly recognize the columns and raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the grouping by columns when the `axis=1` parameter is used. It should be able to recognize the columns and create the Grouping objects accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case when the `axis=1` and the `key` is not a list or tuple. If it's not a list or tuple, we convert it to a list.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that grouping by columns works as expected.
