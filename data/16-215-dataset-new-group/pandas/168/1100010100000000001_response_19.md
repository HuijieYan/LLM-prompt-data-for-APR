In the given code, we define a function `_get_grouper` which takes several arguments and is expected to create a BaseGrouper. The objective is to create an instance of a BaseGrouper by obtaining mappings to create group indexers.

Potential error locations in the function:
1. Comparison of the level with multiindex vs. non-multiindex.
2. The checking whether a key is a Grouper is not accurate.
3. A warning when the key is a tuple may not be working as expected.
4. The logic for index replacement may not be accurate.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely due to issues with handling multiindex vs. non-multiindex, inaccurate comparison of key, incorrect handling of a tuple key, and issues with the logic for index replacement.

Suggested strategy to fix the bug:
1. Carefully review the logic for handling multiindex vs. non-multiindex and ensure it works for both.
2. Review the code to accurately check whether a key is a Grouper.
3. Verify the warning logic for a tuple key and ensure that it is functioning as expected.
4. Check and fix the logic for index replacement and ensure it is implemented correctly to avoid issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
