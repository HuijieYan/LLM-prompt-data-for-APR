## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        group_axis_name = group_axis.name if isinstance(group_axis, Index) else group_axis

        if level != group_axis_name:
            raise ValueError(
                f"level name {level} is not the name of the axis: {group_axis_name}"
            )

    # create the Grouping
    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            key,
            obj=obj,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
    ]

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

After correcting the function, it should now properly handle grouping along the specified axis and return the expected output. This fix should resolve the error and allow the function to work as expected based on the provided test cases and the reported GitHub issue.
