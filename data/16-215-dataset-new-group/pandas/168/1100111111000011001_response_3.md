The buggy function `_get_grouper` contains multiple blocks of code where the `level` and `key` variables are being manipulated and checked for various conditions. However, there are inconsistencies in the handling of these variables that are causing the function to produce incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the `level` and `key` variables correctly in different scenarios. For example, when `level` is a string, the function checks if it is the name of the index, and when `level` is a list, it is handled differently. Similarly, the function attempts to interpret the `key` variable as a list of keys when it is a tuple, and produces a warning if it does.

To fix this bug, we need to standardize the handling of the `level` and `key` variables in the `_get_grouper` function, ensure that they are treated consistently and appropriately in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                level = [level]

            if level:
                if obj.index.name not in level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected version standardizes the handling of the `level` and `key` variables, ensuring consistent treatment in different scenarios. This should address the inconsistent behavior and resolve the bug.
