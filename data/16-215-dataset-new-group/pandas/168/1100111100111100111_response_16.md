The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causes a KeyError when trying to group along the columns using the 'x' label. This issue has been raised in the GitHub repository with the title "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle grouping by column names, resulting in a KeyError. This occurs due to a failure in processing the passed parameters and creating a valid group based on the columns.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify and handle the passed parameters for grouping by columns and create the corresponding groupings. Additionally, the function should iterate over each specified column for grouping and create the necessary Grouping objects for each column.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Assuming other related functions in the same file have been properly implemented

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        if is_list_like(key):
            keys = key
        else:
            keys = [key]

        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for key in keys:
            if key in obj.columns:
                col_values = obj[key]
                ping = Grouping(group_axis, col_values, obj=obj, name=key, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(key)
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # For grouping along the index or default behavior
    # Add handling for other cases as needed

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # ...
```

This version of the function addresses the issue by properly handling the passed parameters for grouping by columns. It iterates over each specified column for grouping, creates the necessary Grouping objects for each column, and then returns the grouper and exclusions as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub repository.
