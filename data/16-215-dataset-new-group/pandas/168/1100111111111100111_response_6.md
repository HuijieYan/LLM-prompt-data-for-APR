The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `groupby` function when using the `axis=1` parameter with column names. The `groupby` function is not correctly grouping by column names, resulting in a KeyError.

The buggy function is lacking proper handling for the `axis=1` parameter when grouping by column names.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. Additionally, there are issues related to checking the level and key, and these need to be carefully revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        # Create a BaseGrouper for grouping by column names
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, key)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:
        # Handle other cases for groupers
        # ...
```

The above modification checks for the type of the `key` parameter and creates a BaseGrouper specifically for grouping by column names when `key` is a string or list of strings. Other cases for groupers are handled as before.

This change should address the issue and enable proper grouping by column names when `axis=1`.

After applying this fix, the failing tests should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
