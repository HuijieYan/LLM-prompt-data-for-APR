### Bug fix

Looking at the code as well as the input and output, the cause of the KeyError appears to be related to the way the variables `key` and `level` are being transformed and assigned. In many instances, the process for handling `level` alters the variable `key`. For instance, in the multi-index instance check block, when `level` is not None, adjustments made to `key` and `level` can change their values and interfere with later processing.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to isolate the variable `key` from alterations related to `level` in the "level is not None" block. These alterations should have no side effects on the subsequent parts of the process.

### Correction

Below is the corrected version of the function. I have made some changes to prevent side effects of processes inside the "level is not None" block on `key`.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            key_is_scalar_and_level_is_scalar = (key is None) and is_scalar(level)
            if key_is_scalar_and_level_is_scalar:
                level = None
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

            # Check for other possible processes that may alter the value of key

    # Other parts of the process remain the same
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
