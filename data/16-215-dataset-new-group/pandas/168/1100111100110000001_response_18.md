The bug is likely to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` is raised when trying to access the keys passed as `group_name` when calling `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()`.

The strategy for fixing the bug should involve carefully checking how the `key` parameter is being handled in the `_get_grouper` function and ensuring that it correctly processes the keys for grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In this corrected version, we identify that the main issue may be due to the handling of the `key` parameter. By slightly modifying how it's processed, we can improve its handling, ensuring that the keys are correctly transformed into a list when necessary. After making these changes, the function should be able to handle the keys correctly, and the failing test should pass.
