### The bug

The key parameter is not handled correctly in the `_get_grouper` function. When the `key` parameter is passed as a string, the code incorrectly treats it as a list (`is_list_like(level)` evaluates to `True`) and doesn't handle the key and level properly. This results in the function not identifying the keys correctly and failing to perform the grouping as expected.

### Approach to fixing the bug

The erroneous handling of the `key` parameter should be addressed. Additionally, the function logic for handling key and level when working with the `obj` DataFrame needs to be reviewed thoroughly.

### Code fix

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    import collections.abc as abc

    # Ensuring that the key is always a list
    if not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper, abc.Sequence)):
        key = [key]

    # Rest of the function as it is
    # ...

```

With this fixed `_get_grouper` function, the `key` parameter will always be treated as a list. Also, the subsequent logic for processing `key` and `level` within the function will work correctly, addressing the issue observed when the single key was treated as a list and not handled properly in the original buggy function.
