### Bug Analysis
The `_get_grouper` function is intended to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which represents the combination of multiple `Grouping` objects while respecting the incoming references to axis, level, and sort. 

The function contains several logical blocks to process input keys. It converts them into a list of keys, checks if the keys are iterable and fully in the reference axis, and creates the groupings accordingly. The function validates that all elements in the keys are hashable, then it checks for groupers from the same class and returns them as BaseGrouper, and issues warnings for handling unhashable elements. Finally, it creates the internals grouper based on the groupings and returns it.

But it currently fails when accessing the `Grouper` at the final conditional block and raises a `KeyError` due to unexpected input key.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling an input key correctly when processing a tuple. It converts the input key to a list without properly checking if the key is a tuple or a list, leading to the subsequent logic failing to correctly process the keys, resulting in a raised `KeyError`.

### Suggested Fix
The bug stems from incorrect handling of the input key when it is a list or tuple. We should adjust the logic to correctly identify the type of iterable at the start of the conditional block and ensure that tuple keys are correctly interpreted as lists of keys. Additionally, we should also ensure that the actual `Grouper` key is correctly identified when the key is a `Grouper` object.

### The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code to validate the rules to process Multiple Grouping objects based on the arguments
    # ...
    
    # Process the key
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        if all(is_scalar(k) for k in key):
            key = [key]

    # Process the keys as a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ...
    # rest of the implementation without changes 
    # ...
```

This corrected version seeks to check if the incoming `key` is of type `tuple` or `list` and accordingly convert a tuple to a list of keys. The remaining logic succeds to process the keys as required to provide the required groupings.
This version will likely resolve the KeyError issues and fuels further testing on the corrected version to ensure stability.
