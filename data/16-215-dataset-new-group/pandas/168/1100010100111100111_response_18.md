## Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the `groupby` function when using the `axis=1` parameter to group by column names. The issue description and the failing tests indicate that the `groupby` function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names, resulting in a KeyError.

The input values for the failing tests are consistent with the reported issue, indicating that the problem lies with the `_get_grouper` function. The variable `key` is being passed as a single string or a list containing a single string, representing the column name to group by.

The `_get_grouper` function is failing in its processing of the `key` parameter for column-based grouping. It is unable to handle the `key` input when it's a string or a list containing a single string representing a column name.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the grouping by column names when the `key` parameter is provided as either a single string or a list containing a single string. This involves identifying the specific area in the function where the KeyError is being raised and addressing the issue in the conditional and looping logic.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Handle single column name string or list containing a single column name
    key = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
    # Add an additional condition for column-based grouping
    if key is not None and axis == 1:
        # Ensure group keys are in the columns
        for k in key:
            if k not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(k)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the modified code, an additional condition is added to handle the case where the `key` represents a single column name string or a list containing a single column name. It checks whether the `key` is not None and the grouping is being done along the columns axis (axis=1). If both conditions are met, it then ensures that the group keys are present in the columns of the DataFrame, raising a KeyError if any key is not found.

This fix addresses the issue of KeyError being raised when attempting to group by column names using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.
