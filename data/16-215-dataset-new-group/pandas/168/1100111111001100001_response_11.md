Looking at the provided cases, the `groupings` variable is an empty list at the end of the `_get_grouper` function, indicating that the for loop might not be appending its values to `groupings`.

Upon analyzing the for loop, the main logic is to create Grouping objects and append them to the `groupings` list. The variable `gpr` holds the value at the index `i` position of the `keys` list. In each iteration, the variables `in_axis` and `name` get assigned a value based on the conditions inside the for loop.

A potential cause of failure is that, due to complexity and conditional logic within the for loop, `in_axis` and `name` may not always be assigned, leading to incomplete Grouping objects. This can result in an empty `groupings` list at the end of the function, making the extracted categoricals incompatible with the object shape.

To fix the bug, it's best to review the conditional logic within the for loop. Ensuring that `in_axis` and `name` are always properly assigned will likely resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    # ... other code ...

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        in_axis = is_in_obj(gpr) or is_in_axis(gpr)
        name = gpr if in_axis else None
        # remaining logic...

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
            if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping)
            else gpr
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This revised code aims to address the conditional logic within the for loop and ensure that `in_axis` and `name` are correctly assigned in every iteration, resulting in properly filled Grouping objects being appended to the `groupings` list.
