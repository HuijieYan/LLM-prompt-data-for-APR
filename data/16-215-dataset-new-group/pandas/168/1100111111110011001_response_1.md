Given the information provided, the cause of the failure seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the 'key' parameter when it is passed as a list in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` call. 

The variable `group_axis` is calculated correctly within the function, and the subsequent processing of `level`, `key`, and the creation of `groupings` seems to be the source of the issue.

To fix the code, we need to update the handling of the 'key' parameter when it is passed as a list. Additionally, it seems that the usage of `key` and `level` within the iteration is causing confusion in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # Simplify the conditional logic for MultiIndex instance
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Simplify the conditional logic for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            # Update the condition for isinstance(level, str)
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )

            # Update the condition for level > 0 or level < -1
            if level < 0:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Use a uniform approach to handling the 'key' parameter
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = key
    elif key is not None:
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = group_axis

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (rest of the implementation stays the same)
```

This correction simplifies the conditional handling of the 'key' and 'level' parameters and uses a uniform approach to handle the 'key' parameter, addressing the failure caused by the incorrect handling of the list passed as the 'key'.
