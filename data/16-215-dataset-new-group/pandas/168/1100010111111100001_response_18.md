Looking at the failing test and the reported error, it is clear that the `_get_grouper` function is failing with a `KeyError` when the input `key` is of type string or list. This indicates that there might be an issue with the input validation for the `key` parameter.

Upon analyzing the input/output values and the runtime behavior, it appears that the code fails to handle the case when `key` is a string or a list, causing it to attempt to treat them as group keys and raise a `KeyError`. 

The root cause of the bug appears to be the way the function handles the `key` parameter and the assumptions it makes about the type of keys. It is assuming a single key value, but in the failing tests, it receives either a string or a list as the key, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle cases where the `key` parameter is a string or a list. This may involve implementing different handling based on the input type of `key`. For a string key, the function should correctly identify it as a single key, and for a list of keys, it should handle each key separately.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    # ... (existing code)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, str)):
        raise ValueError("Invalid type for key, must be a list or a string")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
    # ... (existing code)
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the `key` parameter is of type string or list, and subsequently handles each case separately, correctly building a list of keys when `key` is a list.

By implementing this change, the function should be able to correctly handle different types of input for the `key` parameter, and the failing tests should now pass.
