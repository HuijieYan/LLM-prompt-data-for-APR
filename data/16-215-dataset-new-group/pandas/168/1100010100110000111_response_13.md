## Analysis:
The error occurs when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter, specifically when passing a single string or a list of strings representing column names. The error message indicates that a KeyError is being raised when attempting to group by the specified column name(s).

The cause of this bug is related to the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function. The function includes various checks and conditions for different scenarios when grouping, but it seems that the specific case of grouping by column names when using `axis=1` is not being handled correctly, leading to the KeyError.

The GitHub issue confirms that the expected behavior when using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` is to group by the "x" column label, but the current implementation does not fulfill this expectation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the scenario of grouping by column names when `axis=1`.
2. Specifically focus on the logic for handling column names and identifying the correct columns for grouping.
3. There should be checks to ensure that the column names are valid and exist within the DataFrame.
4. Refactor the code to separate the handling of grouping by index from the handling of grouping by columns.
5. Handle the scenario of grouping by a single column name or a list of column names differently to ensure the correct behavior.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing implementation)

    if axis == 1 and (isinstance(key, str) or (isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key))):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for gpr in keys:
            if gpr not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(f"Column '{gpr}' not found in columns")

            ping = Grouping(
                obj.columns,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )

            groupings.append(ping)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (rest of the implementation remains the same)
```

In the corrected `_get_grouper` function, an additional condition is added to handle the scenario when `axis=1` and the `key` parameter represents column name(s). If `key` is a string or a list of strings (representing column names), it creates the necessary groupings for columns and returns the grouper accordingly.

This fix ensures that when grouping by column names using `axis=1`, the correct columns are identified and the KeyError issue is resolved.
