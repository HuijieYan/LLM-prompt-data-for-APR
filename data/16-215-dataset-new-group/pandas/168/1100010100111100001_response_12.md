The issue in the _get_grouper function is with the logic used to convert the provided 'key' parameter, which is a single key or a list of keys, into the 'keys' variable. This handles the case when 'key' is not a hashable type as a list of keys when it is a tuple.

The fix involves changing the logic for interpreting a tuple 'by' as a list of keys when any unhashable elements are found. Then, the 'keys' should be re-assigned as a list. Moreover, if 'key' is not a list, loop through it and convert the tuple into a list of keys and set 'match_axis_length' as True if the length of 'keys' and 'group_axis' are equal.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing lines unchanged
    
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        keys = list(key)
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # remaining lines of code remain unchanged
```

This fix will address the problem by ensuring that the 'keys' variable always contains a list of keys, whether the input is a tuple or a single key.
