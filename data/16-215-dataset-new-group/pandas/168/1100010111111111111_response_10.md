The issue is related to the `groupby` function on the `DataFrame` with `axis=1`, which is expected to group along the columns. However, it raises a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the column name. This bug is confirmed by the provided test cases.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the logic of the `_get_grouper` function which fails to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of strings for column name groupings.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of strings for column name groupings.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        # Construct a list of keys to group by 
        keys = [key] * len(obj.index)  # Repeat key list for each index
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.index, keys, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (remaining existing function code)
```

This modification checks if `key` is a list of strings, and if it is, it constructs a list of keys to group by using each string in the list, repeating the key list for each index. Then it constructs the `BaseGrouper` based on the constructed keys and returns it.

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now properly handle grouping by column names when `key` is a list of strings.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix would address the issue described in the GitHub report.
