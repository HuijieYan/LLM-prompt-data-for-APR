The code crashes because of the way that the "level" parameter is handled. The function is incorrectly setting "level" to None instead of the specified value if it's an instance of a MultiIndex, which causes an issue when trying to extract level values.

To fix these issues, the function should be updated to handle the "level" parameter differently, particularly for MultiIndex instances. Additionally, there are some common checks in the code which can be simplified. The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the "level" parameter and the overly complex logic for handling certain cases.

One possible fix is to simplify the checks for MultiIndex instances and combine the similar logic for handling the "level" parameter, and to address the mishandling of the level by setting "level" to the specified value if it is an instance of a MultiIndex using a conditional statement rather than setting it to None unconditionally.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Update the level if it is a single level from the group_axis
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None 
        else:
            level, key = handle_non_multiindex_level_cases(level, key, obj, group_axis)

    # [Rest of the function remains unchanged]
```

The function should also include a new method `handle_non_multiindex_level_cases` to handle non-MultiIndex cases. This change should correct the mishandling of the "level" parameter and reduce the complexity of the checks.

The cases will be handled uniformly for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex instances.

This should fix the issues related to the mishandling of the level parameter and simplify the overall function logic.
