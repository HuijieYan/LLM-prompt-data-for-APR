The issue in the function `_get_grouper` is causing a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the column name. The function fails to correctly identify that the 'x' is a column name and tries to access it as an index name, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the condition checking whether the `gpr` is in the object should be updated to handle column names. Additionally, the function should correctly identify the groupings and exclusions based on the input 'key' which could be a single key or list of keys (e.g., column names).

Here's the corrected version of the `groupby` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # check if the key is a list of keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if key in obj.columns:
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, key, obj[key]
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

        # create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle grouping by column name(s) without triggering a `KeyError` and pass the failing test case. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding grouping by column names.
