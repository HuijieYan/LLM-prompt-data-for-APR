## Bug Analysis
The issue occurs when trying to use the `groupby` method with `axis=1` to group by column names. The `_get_grouper` function is not handling the grouping by column names correctly, causing a KeyError. This bug prevents users from grouping DataFrame columns using their names.

## Bug Location
The issue is located within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic related to handling the keys and groupings when grouping by column names.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of grouping by column names in the `_get_grouper` function. The function does not properly identify the column names and does not handle them as expected when `axis=1`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly identify and handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This involves updating the logic related to handling the keys and groupings for column-based grouping.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # handling the case when axis=1 and key is a column name
    if axis == 1 and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple, dict)):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
The fix involves updating the beginning of the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case when `axis=1` and `key` is a column name. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies and handles column names for grouping.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should handle grouping by column names correctly when `axis=1`, resolving the issue and allowing users to group DataFrame columns using their names.
