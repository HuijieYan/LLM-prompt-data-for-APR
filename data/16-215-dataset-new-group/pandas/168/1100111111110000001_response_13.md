The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when the input `group_name` is a list of column names. The function is failing to handle the case when `group_name` is a list, and it's not correctly converting the input keys to a list of keys. This issue is causing the KeyError when trying to extract the groupers from the input DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of `key` when it's a list, and ensure that the correct keys are extracted from the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # ... (existing level handling code)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (rest of the function)

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # ... (existing code for processing each key)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the `key` input is already a list. If it is, the function proceeds by using the keys directly. If not, the function converts the input key to a list before processing further.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the KeyError issue and pass the failing test.
