The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing the `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` to raise a KeyError when the intent is to group by columns, on the "x" column label. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `key` and `level` parameters when grouping by columns.

The issue seems to be related to the fact that the function is not properly handling the grouping by columns when `axis=1`.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for handling the `key` and `level` parameters when `axis=1` is provided. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the columns for grouping when `axis=1` is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            keys = obj.columns
        elif isinstance(key, str):
            keys = [key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            keys = key
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid key for column grouping")

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in keys:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[k],
                name=k,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Handling for axis=0 remains the same
    # ...

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, when `axis=1`, we handle the `key` parameter to retrieve the column names and create Grouping objects for each column, which are then used to create a BaseGrouper.

This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
