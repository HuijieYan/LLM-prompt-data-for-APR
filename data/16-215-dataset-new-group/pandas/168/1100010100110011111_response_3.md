## Solution

The issue in the buggy function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a string or list of strings. Additionally, the code does not handle tuples correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by the column name. 

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be updated to properly handle the `key` parameter as strings or lists of strings when performing groupby on axis 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # ... (code to validate level and group_axis remains unchanged)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # If the key is a string or list of string, convert it to a list
    if isinstance(key, str) or (isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key)):
        key = [key]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    # Create groupings and return grouper, exclusions, obj
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        name = gpr  # Set name to gpr (grouping) for object in axis and else cases

        # Create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,  # Set in_axis to True for object in axis
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
```

By making these changes, the `_get_grouper` function will now handle the `key` parameter correctly, allowing the groupby operation on axis 1 to work as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
