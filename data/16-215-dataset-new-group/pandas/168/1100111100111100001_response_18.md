The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a `KeyError` to be raised. The issue is being triggered by cases in which the `key` argument is a list of one element. This list should be unwrapped to get the key value, as the function is designed to handle one key, not a list of keys of length one. Also, the function seems unnecessarily complex in handling various types of `key` and `level`, resulting in errors, especially when `key` is a list.

To solve this, let's modify the function to correctly handle a list of length one for the `key`. We will also remove unnecessary complication when handling the `level`.

Based on these observations, here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    else:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0]
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle cases when `key` is a list of one element and handle the `level` without unnecessarily complicating the checks.
