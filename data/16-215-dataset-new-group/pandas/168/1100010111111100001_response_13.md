The cause of the bug is that the `groupings` list is empty, which will cause a `ValueError: No group keys passed!` when it reaches the `if len(groupings) == 0` condition in the buggy function. The `groupings` list is expected to be populated with Grouping objects, so the empty list indicates that the function is not creating the `Grouping` objects correctly.

The `Grouping` objects should be constructed and appended to the `groupings` list during the iteration over the keys and levels, based on certain conditions and checks. The function is failing to properly construct these objects, leading to the erroneous behavior and error.

To fix the bug, the function should ensure proper construction of `Grouping` objects and append them to the `groupings` list during the iteration over the keys and levels.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing content in the function remains unchanged

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Additional code to populate groupings list
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip([key], [level])):
        if gpr is not None:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )

            groupings.append(ping)
        else:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By constructing the `Grouping` objects correctly and appending them to the `groupings` list, the function should be able to resolve the issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
