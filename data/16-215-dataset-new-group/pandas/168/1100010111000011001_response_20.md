## Code Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function accepts several parameters and performs multiple checks and operations to construct the grouper.

It is apparent that the function is failing to correctly handle the input parameters and construct the grouper indexers, resulting in incorrect processing. There are conditional checks, loops, and variable assignments within the function that might lead to incorrect construction of the grouper.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug can be identified as the mismanagement of the `key` and `level` parameters within the function. The conditional checks and assignments involved in handling these parameters are not correctly identifying and processing the axis and level information, leading to the incorrect creation of the grouper indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The conditional checks related to `level`, `group_axis`, and `is_list_like` can be reviewed to ensure that they correctly identify the axis and level information and handle the `level` and `key` parameters accordingly.
2. The conditional checks for identifying the type of `key` (such as `is_tuple`) and processing it as a list of keys can also be reviewed.
3. The loop that processes `keys` and `levels` can be reviewed to ensure that they are correctly associated and processed based on the provided input.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # ... (existing code)

        else:
            # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            # (e.g., level=[0])
            # GH 13901
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                # ... (existing code)
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (remaining code)
```
This is a simplified example of the bug-fix, focusing on the specific conditional checks and assignments related to `level` and `key`. The complete bug-fix would involve a detailed review and potential restructuring of the function based on the logic and requirements of the input parameters.
