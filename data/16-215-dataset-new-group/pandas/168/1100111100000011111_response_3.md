## The Bug
The bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function of the `grouper.py` file in the `pandas` library. The function fails to correctly handle grouping along columns when using the `axis=1` parameter.

The problem arises from the conditionals within the function, which should handle groupings along columns but fail to do so, resulting in a KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks within the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle groupings along columns when using the `axis=1` parameter. This might involve modifying the conditionals that check for specific data types and adjusting the logic to match the expected behavior from the GitHub issue.

Additionally, it is important to carefully check the logic and conditions being used to ensure that changes don't have unexpected side effects on other functionalities of the function.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    ...

    if axis == 1:
        if is_list_like(key):
            keys = key
        else:
            keys = [key]

        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=False,
            )
            for gpr in keys
            if gpr in obj
        ]

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:
        # handle groupings along index, similar to the existing logic
        ...
```

In the updated `_get_grouper` function, the conditional for `axis=1` has been explicitly added to handle groupings along columns. It checks if the `axis` parameter is equal to 1, and if so, it creates individual `Grouping` objects for each key using a list comprehension. It then proceeds to create the `BaseGrouper` based on the groupings and returns the result.

This change aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and improve the functionality of grouping along columns.
