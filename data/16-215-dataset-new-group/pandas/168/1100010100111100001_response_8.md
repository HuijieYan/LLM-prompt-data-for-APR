The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is raised when the input `key` is a list in cases where it should not be considered as one. The code does not effectively handle the case where the `key` is provided as a list, and continues to treat it as a single key. This leads to invalid logic and causes a `KeyError`. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a key is passed as a list, it is handled correctly as an iterable of keys. We can achieve this by modifying the logic for evaluating the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # After parameter validation, handle if the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (remaining of the function code)
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly check if the `key` is a list, and handle it accordingly. By including this check, we ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly handled as a list when passed as one. This will prevent the `KeyError` and execute the function logic correctly.

With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
