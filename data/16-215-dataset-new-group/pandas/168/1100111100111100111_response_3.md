The buggy function seems to be failing when trying to group by columns using the "groupby" method with the "axis=1" parameter. Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the function is not correctly handling the groupby operation on columns when provided with a single column name or a list of column names.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the processing of the "key" parameter and the determination of groupings based on the specified columns. The function is not properly interpreting the input column name or list of column names to create the groupings for the columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately interpret the input column names and create the necessary groupings for the groupby operation on columns.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # validate the axis parameter
    if axis not in [0, 1]:
        raise ValueError("axis must be 0 or 1")

    if axis == 0:
        # group along the index (rows)
        return obj.groupby(key, axis=0, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)

    # group along the columns
    if key is None:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed")

    if isinstance(key, (str, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(col in obj.columns for col in key):
            # all keys are valid column names
            column_group = obj[key].sum(axis=1)
            return column_group
        else:
            raise KeyError("One or more of the specified keys are not valid column names")

    raise ValueError("Invalid key for groupby on columns")

```

In this corrected version, we validate the provided axis and handle the groupby operation for columns based on the provided column names. We first check if the provided column names are valid, and then perform the groupby operation to sum the columns based on the specified keys.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the groupby operation on columns and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
