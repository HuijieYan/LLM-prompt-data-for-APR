After analyzing the buggy function and the related functions along with the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function within the `grouper.py` file in the `pandas.core.groupby` module.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the grouping of columns when the `axis=1` argument is passed. This leads to a KeyError being raised when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the grouping of columns when `axis=1` is specified.

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        # Grouping by columns
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        key = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) if is_scalar(k) else k for k in key]
        level = key
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # validation logic here...

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
}
```

In the corrected version, we added a new condition to handle the case when `axis=1` and `key` is specified. We then convert the column names to their respective positions and assign them to `key` and `level`. This ensures that the function properly handles the grouping of columns when `axis=1` is specified.

By making this change, the `_get_grouper` function should now properly handle the grouping of columns, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
