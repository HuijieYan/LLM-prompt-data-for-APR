Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the problem seems to be with the `_get_grouper` function in the `grouper.py` file. The issue is related to the grouping by column names not working as expected when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`.

After analyzing the code, the potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function include handling of the `group_axis`, `level`, and `key` parameters, as well as the logic for determining the grouping based on column names.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditional logic for handling MultiIndex structures and the behavior of the `group_axis`. It also seems that there are inconsistencies in handling the `level` when grouping by column names.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revisiting the conditional blocks related to MultiIndex handling and level validation, and also reviewing the logic for determining the grouping based on column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level) and obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif isinstance(level, int) and (level > 0 or level < -1):
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # ... (remaining code unchanged)
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # ... (remaining code unchanged)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            # ... (remaining code unchanged)
        else:
            keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

            if match_axis_length and level is None and not (any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
                                                           or any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
                                                           or any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)):
                if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                    all_in_columns_index = all(g in (obj.columns if axis == 1 else obj.index.names) for g in keys)
                elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                    all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

                if not all_in_columns_index:
                    key = list(keys)

        # ... (remaining code unchanged)

    # ... (remaining code unchanged)
```

The corrected version aims to address the handling of level, key, and group_axis, ensuring that the grouping works as expected when grouping by column names.

This corrected version should successfully fix the issue reported in the GitHub and also make the failing test pass.
