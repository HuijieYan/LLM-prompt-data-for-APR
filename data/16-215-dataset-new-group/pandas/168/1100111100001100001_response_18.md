The bug in the code is due to the inconsistent treatment of the `level` parameter based on whether `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex` or not. This inconsistency causes issues when processing the key value. The level processing should be consistent regardless of whether `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex` or not.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the code to handle the `level` parameter consistently, regardless of the type of `group_axis` being passed to the function. By streamlining the treatment of the `level` parameter, we can ensure that the code processes the key value correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:

        # Handle level processing consistently
        if is_list_like(level):
            if len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif len(level) == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):

                # Get the level values from group_axis
                if obj.index.names[0] == level:
                    key = obj.index.get_level_values(level)
                    level = None
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )

        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The corrected version of the function ensures consistent processing of the `level` parameter and handles it appropriately based on the type of the `group_axis` being used.

By applying this fix, the function should behave as expected and correctly handle the input cases.
