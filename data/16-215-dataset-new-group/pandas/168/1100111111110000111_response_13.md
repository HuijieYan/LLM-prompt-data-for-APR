The issue seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of the `groupby` function when using the `axis=1` parameter to group by columns. The test function provided in the GitHub issue also indicates that the `groupby` call with `axis=1` is raising a KeyError, which is unexpected.

The bug appears to be in the `_get_grouper` function, where the key is expected to be a column name but is not being correctly processed. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

To fix this bug, we can modify the handling of the key and the conditionals to properly account for grouping by columns using the `axis=1` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            if isinstance(obj.columns, MultiIndex):
                level = obj.columns.names
                key = [obj.columns.get_level_values(level_name) for level_name in level]
            else:
                key = obj.columns
        else:
            if isinstance(key, (str, int)):
                if key not in obj.columns:
                    raise KeyError(key)
            elif isinstance(key, list):
                for k in key:
                    if k not in obj.columns:
                        raise KeyError(k)

        if level is not None:
            raise ValueError("level parameter cannot be used when grouping by columns")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # [...]
    # Existing code for handling groupings, exclusions, and returning grouper

```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case when `axis=1` to infer the key from the dataframe columns. We also validate the provided key to ensure it exists within the dataframe columns. Additionally, we raise a ValueError if the `level` parameter is used when grouping by columns, as it is not applicable.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle grouping by columns using the `groupby` function.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the `test_groupby_axis_1` test to pass without raising a KeyError.
