The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a `KeyError` when the test `test_groupby_axis_1` from the file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py` is executed. The failing test uses both single string values and list-like objects to group the DataFrame. The current implementation fails to handle this correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

The pattern `raise KeyError(gpr)` in the `_get_grouper` function is responsible for the `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles both single string values and list-like objects for grouping, and does not raise a `KeyError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        key = [key]  # Convert single string to list for consistency
    elif key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        raise TypeError("key must be a string, list, or tuple")

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # If key is None or is a list-like object, use key directly, else use group_axis
    if key is None or is_list_like(key):
        if key is not None and len(key) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if obj.index.name != key:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(key)
                )
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

        if gpr in obj:
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name) 
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we handle key as a single string or a list/tuple of strings, and perform the necessary checks and operations accordingly. This corrected version should fix the `KeyError` issue and pass the failing test.
