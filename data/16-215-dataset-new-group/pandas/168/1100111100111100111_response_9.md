## The bug

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list of column names (like in the failing tests). This results in a KeyError when trying to group the DataFrame along the columns.

## Bug cause

The bug seems to be caused by the function not properly handling the case when `key` is passed as a list of column names. The code tries to interpret the list of keys as a single key and does not handle the case where `key` is a list explicitly.

## Strategy to fix the bug

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to properly handle the case when `key` is passed as a list of column names. It should recognize that `key` is a list and iterate over each column name to create the groupings.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Create groupings for each key in the list
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[k],
                obj=obj,
                name=k,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)

        # Create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (rest of the implementation for other cases)
```

The above corrected version of the function explicitly handles the case when `key` is passed as a list of column names. It creates separate groupings for each column in the list and then creates the internals grouper accordingly.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the case when `key` is passed as a list of column names and group the DataFrame along the specified columns without raising a KeyError.

After making these changes, the function should be tested with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is fixed and the function behaves as expected.
