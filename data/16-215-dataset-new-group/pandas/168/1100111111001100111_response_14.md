Based on the provided information, the buggy function code in `_get_grouper` is failing to execute correctly in certain cases. The bug appears to be causing issues with grouping along the columns when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter.

Analyzing the buggy function and its runtime input/output for multiple test cases, it's apparent that the function is not handling the grouping along columns (axis=1) as expected. The key issue arises from the process of determining the appropriate grouping when using `axis=1`.

The fix strategy involves modifying the code within the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case of grouping along columns (axis=1). This may involve adjusting the logic for handling the keys and groupings when the axis is specified as 1.

Based on the analysis and the provided cases, here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            keys = obj.columns
        else:
            keys = key

        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                obj.columns,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            for gpr in keys
        ]

        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # The rest of the function for axis=0 or general case
    # ...
```

This updated logic includes a specific block of code to handle the case when `axis=1`. It correctly sets the `keys` to the columns of the DataFrame and creates `Grouping` instances for each column, then constructs the `BaseGrouper` based on the groupings.

With this corrected version, the function should now be able to handle the grouping along columns as expected.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also resolve the failing test cases.
