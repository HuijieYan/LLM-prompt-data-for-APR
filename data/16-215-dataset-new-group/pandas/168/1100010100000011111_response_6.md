The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is preventing the `groupby` operation from working correctly when grouping by columns (`axis=1`). This results in a KeyError, even when the column name is explicitly specified.

The issue on GitHub describes the problem as the `groupby` operation not offering implicit selection by column name(s), even though the documentation implies that it should work.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves checking for the presence of column names and allowing grouping by the columns in the `groupby` operation. This will involve modifying how the `keys` are determined and the creation of the `Grouping` objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = {}
    if key is not None:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]
        for k in key:
            if k in obj.columns:
                keys[obj.columns.get_loc(k)] = k

    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (column_index, col_name) in enumerate(keys.items()):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[column_index],
            obj=obj,
            name=col_name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles grouping by columns and follows the expected input/output values. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to grouping by columns not working as expected.
