### Analysis
The `_get_grouper` function is related to the error message `KeyError: 'x'` and the failing test. The error is indicating that the key `'x'` is not found or is not a valid key when using it to perform a groupby operation on a DataFrame.

Potential error locations are in the logic for handling the `key` parameter and the checks for the validity of the key and its alignment with the specified axis and level.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the specified `key` when it's passed as a list, as indicated by the failing test. It seems that the function is expecting a single key instead of a list of keys and is failing to handle the list properly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic for handling the `key` parameter so that it can correctly handle both single keys and lists of keys.

### Updated Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function logic)
    
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = keys is None or len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # What are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # Process the keys in the list
    for key in keys:
        # Validate the single level
        if level is not None and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            # ... (remaining logic)
    
    # ... (remaining logic)
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the updated function, the `key` parameter is processed to handle both single keys and lists of keys. Additionally, the subsequent logic in the function has been adapted to work with the modified handling of the `key` parameter. This should resolve the issue with the failing test and the KeyError.
