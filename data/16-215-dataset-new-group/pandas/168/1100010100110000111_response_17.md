The issue with the `_get_grouper` function is that it raises a `KeyError` when trying to group by column name(s), even though the intent is to group by columns. This issue was raised on GitHub as the `groupby` operation with `axis=1` was unexpectedly raising a `KeyError` when trying to group by column names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when grouping by column names. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function handles grouping by column names correctly and does not raise a `KeyError` in this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Validate key for column names
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise ValueError(f"key '{key}' is not a column in the DataFrame")

    # Create groupings based on the key, axis, and level
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version:
- We first ensure that the level and key are handled correctly based on whether the axis indicates column or index.
- We then validate the key for column names and raise a `ValueError` if the key is not a valid column name.
- The rest of the function remains unchanged.

With this corrected function, the issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the `groupby` operation with `axis=1` should work as expected.
