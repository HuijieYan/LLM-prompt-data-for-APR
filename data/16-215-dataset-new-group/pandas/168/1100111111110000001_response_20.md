The key error in the `_get_grouper` function is due to the fact that it does not handle the case when `key` is a list instead of a single value when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list in the failing test. To fix this, we can modify the function to handle both single values and lists as the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # check if key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # iterate over the keys
    for key in keys:
        for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):

            # the nested code remains unchanged

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This modification allows the function to handle cases when the `key` parameter is a list, and it iterates over the list of keys, creating groupings for each key before returning the grouper, exclusions, and object.

By making this change, the corrected `_get_grouper` function should now pass the failing test case.
