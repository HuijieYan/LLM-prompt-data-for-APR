The buggy function is failing to handle the case when the `key` parameter is a string or list of strings and the `axis` parameter is set to 1. As a result, it raises a KeyError when attempting to group the DataFrame along the columns. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when grouping along the columns.

Based on the provided runtime input values, types, and the failing tests, I have analyzed the bug and identified the cause. The `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of grouping along the columns. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Convert single key string to a list of keys

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, list):
        # Group by columns
        keys = key
        groupings = []
        for k in keys:
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    obj[k],
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, keys, obj

    # ... (remaining code for other cases)
```

With this modification, the `_get_grouper` function can correctly handle the case of grouping along the columns when the `key` parameter is a string or list of strings. This should resolve the KeyError issue and make the function behave as expected.

After making these changes, the corrected version can be tested with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is fixed.

Once the changes are verified to be working correctly, the corrected version of the function should be updated in the pandas codebase to resolve the GitHub issue and improve the functionality of the `groupby` feature.
