The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the `level` and `key` parameters are handled, as well as the creation of the `group_axis` variable and handling of `keys`. It appears that there are issues with the logic for different types of input values for `level` and `key`, including single values, lists, and tuples.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for handling `level` and `key` to ensure that they are correctly processed based on their types. Additionally, it seems that the construction of the `group_axis` variable and the checks for `is_tuple`, `all_hashable`, and `match_axis_length` need to be carefully reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif not (-1 <= level < len(group_axis)):
                raise ValueError("Invalid level value for the given axis")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if not set(key).issubset(obj.columns) and set(key).issubset(obj.index):
            msg = ("Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                   "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. "
                   "In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.")
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

Please note that this is just a snippet of the function and some parts may still need to be revised. This corrected version should address the potential bugs related to handling `level`, `key`, and the creation of `group_axis`.
