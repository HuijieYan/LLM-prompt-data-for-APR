The bug in the code is that the `key` value, when it's a list, is not handled correctly. When `groupby` is called with `group_name` as a list, such as `["x"]`, it should be interpreted as a single key rather than an iterable of keys.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_grouper` expects `key` to be a single key, but when it's a list, it doesn't handle it properly and raises a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `key` input needs to be updated to correctly interpret it as a single key when it's a list.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    # handle the key input
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
        # Convert list input to a single key
        is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
        all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

        if is_tuple:
            if (
                all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
            ) or not all_hashable:
                msg = (
                    "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                    "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                    "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
                )
                warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
                keys = list(key)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_grouper` function should now properly handle the case when `key` is a list of keys.

This corrected version should address the issue and allow the function to correctly interpret the input `key` as a single key or as a list of keys, as appropriate.
