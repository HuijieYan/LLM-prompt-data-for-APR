The function involves several conditional blocks and loops. It initializes a `group_axis` variable, processes `level` and `key`, then iterates over the `keys` and `levels` lists in a for loop to create the `groupings` variable.

The issues in the existing function are with the conditionals, the processing of `level` and `key`, and the creation of `groupings` variable. To fix the issues, the function has been completely restructured.

The modified function includes changes to the logic within the conditional blocks and the for loop to calculate the values for `keys`, `levels`, `groupings`, and `exclusions`.

The modified function has been tested to ensure it meets the expected input/output values and passes the provided failing test case.
