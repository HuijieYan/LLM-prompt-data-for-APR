The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the grouping by column names in pandas. The function is not correctly identifying the keys passed for grouping, resulting in a KeyError. This issue has been reported on GitHub as "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The root cause of the bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function. When the `key` parameter is provided as a list of column names, the function fails to properly handle the grouping and throws a KeyError.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when the `key` parameter is provided as a list of column names for grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ...

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr in keys:
        if gpr in obj.columns:
            in_axis = True
            name = gpr
        else:
            in_axis = False
            name = None

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the `key` parameter is a list. If it is, the function proceeds to create groupings for each key in the list. After creating the groupings, the function constructs the BaseGrouper and returns the result.

This updated function should address the issue and ensure that grouping by column names works as expected.

After making this change, it's recommended to run the failing test cases to verify that the corrected function now passes the tests. If the tests pass, the fix can be submitted for review and inclusion in the pandas library.
