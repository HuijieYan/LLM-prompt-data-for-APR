There is a `KeyError` being raised at the end of the `_get_grouper` function, specifically at this line: 

```python
raise KeyError(gpr)
```

This error is occurring when the `group_name` is provided as a list, for example, `group_name = ['x']` in the failing test case. The `_get_grouper` function is trying to access the key 'x' from the object `obj`, but it's not finding it and hence raising a `KeyError`.

The cause of the issue is that the `_get_grouper` function is treating the list of group names as a single key, whereas it should treat it as a list of keys.

To fix the bug, the condition that handles the `key` input needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when it's a list of keys. This can be done using a simple if-else condition to check the type of the `key` input and behave accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... [rest of the docstring remains the same]

    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Check if the input key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key  # Use the list of keys directly
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]  # Convert single key to a list
        match_axis_length = False

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function will handle the list of group names correctly and not raise a `KeyError` when provided as a list.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
