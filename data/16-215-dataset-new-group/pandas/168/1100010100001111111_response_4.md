Based on the provided code and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `_get_grouper` is not correctly handling the groupings by columns when the `axis=1`. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by columns, which is unexpected behavior.

The bug appears to be in the handling of the `axis=1` case, specifically when trying to group by columns using the "by" argument. The function is not correctly parsing the "by" argument for columns, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the groupings by columns when `axis=1` and the "by" argument is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function based on the provided bug and the expected input/output values:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...
    # (existing code)

    if axis == 0:
        # In the case of axis=0, group along the index
        group_axis = obj.index
    elif axis == 1:
        # In the case of axis=1, group along the columns
        group_axis = obj.columns
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for axis")
    
    # ... (rest of the function)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, we check the value of `axis` to determine whether to group along the index or the columns. If `axis` is 1, we use `obj.columns` for the `group_axis`. This should allow the function to correctly handle groupings by columns when `axis=1`.

This correction should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
