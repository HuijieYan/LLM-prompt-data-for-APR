Based on the provided information, the issue with the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when attempting to group along columns using the `groupby` method with axis=1.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when grouping along columns. The `_get_grouper` function does not properly recognize column names as valid keys when grouping along the columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle column names as keys when grouping along columns. It should also handle the case when `key` is a single column name by converting it to a list of keys. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_get_grouper` function properly identifies the type of key being passed (index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers) and create a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function implementation)

    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Convert key to a list if it's a single column name
    if key is not None and is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    # Continue with the rest of the function implementation...

```

With this corrected version of the `get_grouper` function, it should handle grouping along columns correctly, allowing for implicit selection by column name(s).

This fix should address the KeyError that was observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

Please note that the corrected function provided here is a simplified version for demonstration purposes, and it may need to be integrated into the actual codebase with additional considerations for Pandas' internal mechanisms and coding standards.
