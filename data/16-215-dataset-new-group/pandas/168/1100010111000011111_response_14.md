Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the failing test, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of the `group_name` parameter when grouping along the columns. The bug causes a KeyError, preventing the function from correctly grouping the columns. The `groupings` list is empty and does not contain the necessary information for grouping the columns, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the `groupings` list is populated with the correct information for grouping along the columns. This involves checking for the existence of the specified column names and processing the grouping accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if axis == 1:
        if key in obj.columns:
            keys = [obj.columns.get_loc(key)]
        elif is_list_like(key):
            keys = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) for k in key if k in obj.columns]
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True
        ) for gpr in keys
    ]

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

In the corrected version, when `axis` is 1, we directly handle the column grouping by populating the `groupings` list with the necessary information for grouping along the columns. We also address cases where a single key or a list of keys are passed. This should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to group along the columns.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It addresses the issue posted in the GitHub report by ensuring that grouping along the columns works as expected.
