The issue in the buggy function is with the logic to handle `key` being a list. Currently, when `key` is a list, the variable `keys` is set as `[key]`, which causes an issue because the algorithm assumes that `len(keys) == len(group_axis)`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `keys` is always a list. We can achieve this by wrapping the code that handles `key` as a list inside an `if` condition to check if `key` is not already a list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `level` is not a list, and in that case, we need to convert `level` to a list. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = list(level)  # convert level to a list
    else:
        levels = [level]
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
