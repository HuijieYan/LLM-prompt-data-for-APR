The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is with the way the `level` parameter is handled, especially when a multi-index DataFrame is involved. The level handling for non-MultiIndex is not consistent and can lead to a `KeyError`. 

To fix this issue, the code that handles the `level` parameter needs to be refactored to ensure that the logic is consistent for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other function body remains the same)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # always consider level as an array-like object
            level = ensure_categorical(level, group_axis)
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                level = [level]

            if not group_axis.contains(level, level=level):
                raise ValueError("level must be in the index")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

The changes involve ensuring that `level` is always considered as an array-like object. In the case of MultiIndex, the code uses `ensure_categorical` to handle the level properly. And in the non-MultiIndex case, the code checks if the level is in the index.

With these changes, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the `level` parameter consistently for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex DataFrames, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
