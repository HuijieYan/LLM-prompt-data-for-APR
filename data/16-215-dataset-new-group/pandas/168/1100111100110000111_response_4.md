The issue with the `_get_grouper` function is that it is not correctly handling the `key` parameter when it is a list of column names for grouping along the columns axis. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. The current implementation of the function is not correctly checking for column names as keys when grouping along the columns axis.

The first step for fixing the bug would be to modify the section of code where the key is checked. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `key` is a list of column names. We also need to ensure that the function checks for the existence of the keys in the columns of the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # Check if all keys are present in the columns
        all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)

        if all_in_columns_index:
            # If all keys are present in the columns, use them as groupings
            groupings = [
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    obj[key],
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                for key in keys
            ]
        else:
            raise KeyError(keys)  # Raise a KeyError if any key is not found in columns
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

With this modification, the `_get_grouper` function will correctly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. It will check for the existence of each key in the columns of the DataFrame and raise a KeyError if any key is not found.

This should fix the bug and ensure that grouping by column names works as expected.

Additionally, the function should also handle the case when `level` is a list or tuple, and ensure that the error handling is consistent and complete for all possible input scenarios.

Updating the function according to the provided correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

The corrected `_get_grouper` function should now handle the grouping by column names correctly, ensuring that the test cases pass without raising any KeyErrors.
