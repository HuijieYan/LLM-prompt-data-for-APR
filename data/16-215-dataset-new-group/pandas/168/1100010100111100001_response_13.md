The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is caused by the `key` being passed as a list when it is not in an iterable form, and the condition `match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)` not being met. This makes the `keys` to be just a list with one item instead of a list of keys.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list that needs to be expanded into a full list of keys that match the lengths of `group_axis`. We also need to ensure that the condition `match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)` is correctly set.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle the case where `key` is a list that needs to be expanded into a full list of keys
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1: 
        key = key[0]

    # the condition `match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)`
    match_axis_length = len(key) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (continue with the previous code)
```

This updated function will fix the bug by ensuring that `keys` has the correct format and length. It should now be able to correctly group a DataFrame based on the specified key(s) without raising a KeyError.
