The buggy function `_get_grouper` has caused the test cases `test_groupby_axis_1` to fail with a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column name 'x'.

The issue is related to the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically when the `key` is a single string or a list of strings. This leads to the function failing to properly interpret the keys for grouping by column names.

To fix this, the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to properly recognize the column names and handle them as intended for grouping by the specified column(s).

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling grouping by column names
    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            # Create a Grouping for each column name
            groupings = [
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    obj[key],
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            ]
            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, [], obj

        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list) and all(col in obj.columns for col in key):
        # Create a Grouping for each column name in the list
        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[col],
                obj=obj,
                name=col,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            for col in key
        ]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By making the changes as outlined above, the corrected function will properly handle grouping by column names when the `key` parameter is a single string or a list of strings.

This correction will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue, allowing the `groupby` function to work as expected when grouping by column names.

After implementation and testing of the corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases and address the reported issue.
