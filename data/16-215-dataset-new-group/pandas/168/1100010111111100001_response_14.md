The bug in the function `_get_grouper` seems to be that the values of `keys` and `exclusions` are not being correctly assigned. The issue stems from the condition checking for the presence of a tuple in the input key. When the key is a list rather than a single value, the validation goes wrong, causing the subsequent logic to fail, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised. 

A potential strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the logic that checks the type of the input key and ensure the appropriate assignment of the `keys`, `exclusions`, and `groupings` lists based on the type of the input parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... [existing implementation]
    
    from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import Grouping
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # Convert key to a list
        keys = list(key) if isinstance(key, tuple) else key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        for k in keys:
            # Create the Grouping
            gpr = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed
            )
            groupings.append(gpr)

        exclusions = [gpr.grouper for gpr in groupings]

    else:
        # This part of the logic is retained for scalar key values
        # ...

    # ... [remaining existing implementation]

    # Return the updated grouper, exclusions, and obj
    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
```

By implementing the changes suggested above, this corrected version of the function will correctly handle cases where the input key is a list or tuple. This should resolve the issue and enable the function to pass the failing tests.
