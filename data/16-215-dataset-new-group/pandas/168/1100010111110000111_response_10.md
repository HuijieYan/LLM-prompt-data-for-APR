## Fixing the bug
- The issue is caused by the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling the case when `group_name` is a list containing a single element.
- The function is expecting `group_name` to be a single string, but when it's provided as a list containing a single string, the function is unable to handle it correctly.
- To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the case when `group_name` is a list containing a single element.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # convert group_name to a single key if it's a list with a single element
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when `group_name` is provided as a list containing a single element, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. This should also make the function compatible with the failing test case provided.
