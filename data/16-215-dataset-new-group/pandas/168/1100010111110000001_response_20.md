There is a bug in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. However, it fails to handle the case where `group_name` is a list (e.g., `['x']`). The bug results in a `KeyError` because the function doesn't handle the list of group names properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle `group_name` when it is a list, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle both single group names and lists of group names properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle the case where group_name is a list
    if isinstance(group_name, list):
        key = group_name  # set key to be the list of group names
        level = None  # reset level to None

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if `group_name` is a list, and if so, we set the `key` to be the list of group names and reset the `level` to `None`.

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle both single group names and lists of group names correctly.
