The problem in the existing implementation of the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `group_name` parameter when it's passed as a list instead of a single value. When `group_name` is passed as a list, the buggy function is not able to handle it correctly, leading to a KeyError.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Check the condition where the `group_name` is received as a list.
2. Modify the key handling logic to appropriately handle a list of keys and ensure that the function is able to create a BaseGrouper when `group_name` is a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level and isinstance(level, list) and len(level) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple levels are only valid with MultiIndex")
    
    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, k in enumerate(keys):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            k,
            obj=obj,
            level=level[0] if isinstance(level, list) else level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=False,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if `level` is a list, and if so, it only uses the first level. The function also handles the case where `key` is a list, using each key to create a Grouping object and then creating a BaseGrouper from the groupings. This should address the issue with the failing test case where `group_name` is passed as a list.

With these changes, the `_get_grouper` function should be able to handle a list of keys correctly, and the failing test should now pass.
