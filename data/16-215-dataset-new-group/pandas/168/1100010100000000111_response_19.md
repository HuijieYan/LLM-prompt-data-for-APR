The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `groupby` function when using the `axis=1` parameter to group by column names. The expected behavior is to group the dataframe by column names and perform the sum operation, but the actual result is a KeyError.

The potential error locations within the `buggy` function could be related to the logic for handling the `key` and `level` parameters, as well as the checks for whether the grouper is in the axis or in the object.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles the `axis=1` parameter and the corresponding column names. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the column names as groupers when the `axis=1` parameter is passed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling the `key` and `level` parameters, and ensure that the function correctly identifies the column names as groupers when the `axis=1` parameter is passed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        level = obj.columns.get_loc(level)

    if key is None:
        key = level
        level = None

    if isinstance(key, (str, int)):
        key = [key]

    groupings = [Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    key,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True
                )]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly handle the `axis=1` parameter and properly group the dataframe by column names when the `groupby` function is called with `axis=1`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
