The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is related to the grouping operation failing when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter, leading to a KeyError. This issue is reported in GitHub with the title "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function are the checks and conditions related to the group_axis and the level. The issue seems to be caused by the check for MultiIndex and the handling of the level parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the code that handles the level parameter and the type of axis. We need to ensure that the grouping operation works correctly when grouping by column names using `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        key = level
        level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Create the Grouping
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    for gpr in keys:
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                sort=sort,
                in_axis=True,
            )
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the logic of the `_get_grouper` function, we ensure that the grouping operation by column names using `axis=1` works as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue.
