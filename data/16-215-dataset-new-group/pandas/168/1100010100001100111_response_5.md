Based on the input parameter values and types as well as the variables right before the function's return, the bug in the _get_grouper function seems to be related to the handling of the key parameter when grouping along columns (axis=1).

The bug is likely due to the code not properly handling the case where the key is a list of column names when grouping along columns. This results in the KeyError being raised, as observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to correctly handle the case where the key is a list of column names when grouping along columns (axis=1). The code should also ensure that the grouping operation works as expected when grouping along columns.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None or isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]

        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == obj.shape[1]

        if match_axis_length:
            groupings = []
            exclusions = []

            for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
                ping = (
                    Grouping(
                        obj.columns,
                        gpr,
                        obj=obj,
                        name=gpr,
                        level=level,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(gpr)

            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj._get_axis(1), groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, exclusions, obj
        else:
            raise ValueError("Length of key and axis must be the same")

    # ... (existing code for other axis)
```

Using the updated code, the function now properly handles the case where the key is a list of column names when grouping along columns. It creates Grouping objects for each key in the list and combines them into a BaseGrouper.

This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.

Please note that the code above assumes that the necessary import statements are included in the environment. If any additional imports are required, they should be added at the top of the file.
