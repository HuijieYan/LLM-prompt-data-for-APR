Bug in the given function:
The "_get_grouper" function is designed to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. However, in the provided implementation, the function seems to be incorrectly handling the determination of key and level based on the input parameters. For some cases, the key is not being processed correctly when provided as a list.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when the key parameter is provided as a list of keys, which is leading to a KeyError in the subsequent logic.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the "_get_grouper" function, we need to account for the different scenarios when the key parameter may be provided as a single key or a list of keys. We need to handle the case for a list of keys appropriately to ensure that the subsequent logic for groupings is processed accurately.

Updated Function after Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function body)

    # Handle the case when key is provided as a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        for k in key:
            groupings.append(Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            ))
        # Skip the rest of the logic related to key
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    # ... (remaining existing function body)
```

With this fix, the function should appropriately handle the case when the key parameter is provided as a list of keys, ensuring that no KeyError occurs. This will enable the function to create the necessary groupings for the BaseGrouper.
