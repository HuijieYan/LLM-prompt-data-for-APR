The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the function handles groupings by column names when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. This issue was reported on GitHub with the title "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The bug seems to stem from the way the function handles the input parameters and constructs the `BaseGrouper`. Based on the runtime values and types of variables in the input parameters of the buggy function, it's clear that the function is not handling the grouping by column names as expected.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. It should correctly create the `BaseGrouper` based on the column names and apply the groupby operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(
            group_axis, [obj[key]], sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated
        )
        return grouper, [], obj

    # For other cases or when key is not a string, handle as before
    # ... (existing logic for other cases)

    # Existing logic for other cases
    # ...

```

In the corrected version of the function, when `axis=1` and `key` is a string (i.e., a column name), it creates a `BaseGrouper` based on the column name and returns the grouper. For other cases or when `key` is not a string, it will handle the grouping as before.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
