Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function provided, it seems that the issue is related to the `groupby` method not properly handling the grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the section where it checks for the presence of the grouping key in the columns. This check may not be properly handling the case when grouping by column names with `axis=1`.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the case when grouping by column names with `axis=1`, leading to a `KeyError` being raised even though the intent is to group by column labels.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to review the logic responsible for handling the grouping by column names and ensure it correctly identifies and processes the column labels.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...

    # existing code (up to the point of potential bug location)

    # handle grouping by column names
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # convert single column name to a list

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # rest of the existing code (after the potential bug location)

    # continue with rest of the function
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to handle the case when `axis=1` and the `key` is a single column name. It converts the single column name to a list, which ensures that the grouping by column is properly handled.

This correction aims to address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and should resolve the unexpected `KeyError` when trying to group by column names using `axis=1`.
