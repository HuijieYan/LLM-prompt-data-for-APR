## The bug

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is preventing the grouping of columns when using the `groupby` function with `axis=1` and a column name as the grouping key. The bug causes a `KeyError` to be raised, even though the intent is to group by columns on the specified column label.

## Cause of the bug

The bug appears to be located in the logic for processing the grouping key when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, indicating that the grouping should be performed on the columns. There is a condition that mistakenly considers the column name as part of the index rather than as a column. This condition leads to an incorrect processing flow, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to perform the grouping on the columns.

## Bug fix strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic correctly identifies and processes the grouping key as a column label when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements and variable processing related to the grouping key and the `axis` parameter.

## The corrected version

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
      # Validate the passed single level for compatibility with the axis of the object

      # Removed the MultiIndex check as it causes the bug
      if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
          level = level[0]

      if key is None and is_scalar(level):
          key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
          level = None
      # ...

    if axis == 1:  # Check for column grouping
        if isinstance(key, str):  # Correctly identify the column label
            if obj.columns.name != key:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Column name {} is not the name of the columns".format(key)
                )
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            if any(col not in obj.columns for col in key):
                raise ValueError("One or more keys are not valid column names")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By adjusting the logic to properly identify and process the grouping key as a column label when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, we can fix the bug and allow the `groupby` function to correctly group by columns using the specified column label.
