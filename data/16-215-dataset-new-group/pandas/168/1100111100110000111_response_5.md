The bug in the provided function is caused by the `KeyError` raised when trying to group by columns using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`. The bug prevents grouping by column names, which is not the expected behavior according to the documentation. The GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" provides a clear example of this bug and the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function in a way that allows grouping by column names as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Omitted code for the level validation and handling

    if isinstance(obj, DataFrame) and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj:
        return key, [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the `obj` is a DataFrame, and if the `key` is a string and exists in the DataFrame columns. If so, we return the column key, an empty list for exclusions, and the original DataFrame `obj`.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names and pass the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue. This fix aligns with the expected behavior of grouping by column names in Pandas.
