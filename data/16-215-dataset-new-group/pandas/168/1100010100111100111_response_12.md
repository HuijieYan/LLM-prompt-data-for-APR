## Correction of the bug in the function

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function may be causing the `KeyError` issue, which is not handling the case when the `key` parameter is a list. The function does not account for this possibility and only handles a single string as the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list, and for each element in the list, perform the necessary grouping and summation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling the case when the key parameter is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        results = {}
        for k in key:
            results[k] = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate)

        return results

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function will handle both single keys and list of keys properly for the `groupby` operation.

This change should resolve the `KeyError` issue when the `groupby` method is called with a list of keys.

After making this correction, the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue should pass successfully.

The corrected function addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and resolves the KeyError problem.

Remember to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that it produces the expected results with various input combinations.
