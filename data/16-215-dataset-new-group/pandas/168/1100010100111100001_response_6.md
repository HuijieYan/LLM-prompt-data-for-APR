The current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function incorrectly handles situations when the `level` parameter is not `None`. 

The issue seems to occur when the `level` parameter is a list-like object, in which case the code incorrectly sets `level` to the first element, rather than using it for processing. This is the cause of the `KeyError` that's being raised.

A potential strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the section of the `_get_grouper` function that handles cases when `level` is not `None`. Specifically, adjustments need to be made to ensure that all elements in the `level` list are processed accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that accounts for the described fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle level as a list-like object
        if is_list_like(level):
            levels = level
            keys = []
            for level_value in levels:
                key = obj.index.get_level_values(level_value)
                keys.append(key)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # ... (remaining code)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these changes, we ensure that for each `level` value in a list, the corresponding keys are accurately derived from `obj.index` for creating the `groupings` list.

After including these adjustments, the `_get_grouper` function should handle scenarios with list-like `level` parameters without raising `KeyError` and pass the failing tests.
