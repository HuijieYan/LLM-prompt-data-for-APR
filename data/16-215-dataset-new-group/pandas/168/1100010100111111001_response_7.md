### Bug Explanation
In the `else` block, two logical conditions are not exclusive due to the second condition `level<0` being always `False`. This results in both conditions being evaluated as `True` and leading to an incorrect value of `level` and `key` after they are updated. Therefore, this inconsistency in updating the variables causes the buggy function to return the wrong results.

### Bug Fix
Adjust the second logical condition to be inclusive and mutually exclusive with the preceding ones. This modification should ensure that the evaluation of the logical conditions proceeds as expected.

### The corrected function will be:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # previous code (as is)

    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
        
        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif level >= 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level >= 0 or level <= -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # the remainder of the code (as is)
```

With this fix, the logical conditions will work as intended, and the problem with updating `level` and `key` will be resolved.
