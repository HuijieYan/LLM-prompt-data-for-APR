The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter and its interaction with the `group_axis` when `axis=1`. The bug prevents the function from correctly grouping the DataFrame based on the specified column names.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not appropriately handling the case where `axis=1` and `key` is a column name or list of column names. This is causing the function to incorrectly process the `group_axis` and the `keys` leading to incorrect groupings and eventually raising errors.

Given the information and the source code provided, a potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic related to handling `key` and `axis=1`. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case when `key` is a column name or list of column names. The logic for identifying and processing the column names needs to be corrected to ensure the function can accurately group the columns based on the specified keys.

Here's the revised version of the `_get_grouper` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous function body)

    if axis == 1:
        # Handle case for grouping along columns
        if key is not None:
            if isinstance(key, str):
                key = [key]

            group_axis = obj[key]
            groupings = []
            exclusions = []

            for i, gpr in enumerate(key):
                ping = Grouping(
                    group_axis, gpr, obj=obj, name=gpr, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True
                )
                groupings.append(ping)

            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (rest of the function as it is for handling other cases)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this revised version, when `axis=1` and `key` is provided, it ensures that the grouping is correctly handled based on the provided column names. This can prevent the KeyError and accurately group the DataFrame by the specified column names.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the case of grouping along columns when `axis=1` and `key` is a column name or list of column names.

This revised version addresses the bug and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
