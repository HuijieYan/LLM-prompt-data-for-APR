There are a few potential error locations in the buggy function. One specific area is where the function `_get_grouper` refers to the function `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj`. These functions act as helper functions but are not defined within the `_get_grouper` function, hence raising a NameError.

To fix this, the helper functions should be included within the `_get_grouper` function and the calls to these functions should be updated to reference them correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function with the included helper functions:
```python
# corrected _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (other function comments)

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # include the helper functions inside the _get_grouper function
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            try:
                obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
            except Exception:
                return False

        return True

    def is_in_obj(gpr):
        try:
            return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
        except Exception:
            return False

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By including the missing helper functions (`is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj`) within the `_get_grouper` function, and fixing the references to these functions, we have resolved the NameError and corrected the bug.
