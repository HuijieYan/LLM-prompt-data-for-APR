Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, the bug seems to be related to the `groupby` method not handling the `axis=1` parameter correctly when grouping along columns by column names.

The bug is likely in the `_get_grouper` function, where it checks for the existence of the `group_axis` and the `level` values. When grouping by columns with the `axis=1` parameter, the function does not handle the columns correctly.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle column grouping when the `axis=1` parameter is passed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if level is not None or axis == 1:
        if axis == 1 and key is None:
            key = group_axis
            level = None

    if level is not None:
        # handling of level for columns
        if axis == 1 and isinstance(group_axis, DataFrame):
            key = level
            level = None

    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)):
        # convert key to list if it's not already a list
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]

        # convert key to list of columns for axis=1
        if axis == 1:
            key = [key]

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function, we added handling for the `axis=1` parameter and modified the logic for `key` and `level` when grouping along columns. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and improve the handling of column grouping with the `groupby` method.
