I can see that the function uses the value of the `key` parameter to select grouped data from the object and encounters a KeyError when the `key` is the string 'x'. It produces correct results when the `key` is a list with a single wild-card element, such as ['x']. 

The root cause of the issue is that when a string is passed as the `key` instead of a list, the function is not interpreting it as a wild-card for axis labels, but as an exact label. This causes a KeyError if the label is not found in the axis.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case when the `key` is a string, treating it as a wild-card for axis labels. When `key` is a list, the function should process each element in the list individually.

Let's update the `_get_grouper` function to handle these cases appropriately:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    #... (previous code)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Treat single string as a list
    elif key is None:
        # No group keys passed
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    for k in key:
        # The rest of the code should handle each element in `key` individually
        # ... (remaining logic for processing each element of `key`)

```
