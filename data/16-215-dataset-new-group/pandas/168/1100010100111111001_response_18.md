The explanation, based on the runtime input/output variable values and expected input/output variable values, leads to the conclusion that the bug is caused by a wrong datatype of the key input parameter. The bug can be fixed by parsing any non-list key input parameter to a list before proceeding with the calculations of `groupings`, `exclusions`. The fixed function should include this logic.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # Ensure key is always a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With the fix implemented, the function now correctly handles whether the keys input parameter is in the form of a single element or a list, ensuring all subsequent processing on the variable `keys` is correctly handled.
