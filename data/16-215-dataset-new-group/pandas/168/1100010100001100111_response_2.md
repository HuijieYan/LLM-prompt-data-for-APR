Based on the provided GitHub issue and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the grouping by column names properly. It is expecting the groupers to be index labels, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle grouping by column names correctly. This can be achieved by checking if the groupers are columns, and then handling the grouping based on the column names. Additionally, any relevant condition checks and transformations related to grouping by column names need to be adjusted to ensure that the function works as expected.

Based on the analysis, below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    if level is not None:
        # Add handling for grouping by columns
        if isinstance(group_axis, Index):
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0]  # Allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            if level == key:  # Check if level matches the key, indicating grouping by columns
                key = group_axis  # Set key to group_axis, indicating grouping by columns
                level = None

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version of the function, an additional condition is added to check if the level matches the key, indicating grouping by columns. If the condition is met, the key is set to group_axis, indicating grouping by columns. This modification allows the function to handle grouping by columns correctly.

By making this change, the function should now be able to handle grouping by column names as expected, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
