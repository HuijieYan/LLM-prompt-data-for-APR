The issue appears to be related to the `groupby` function not properly handling grouping by columns when using the `axis=1` parameter. The issue is specifically occurring when trying to group by column name(s) using `axis=1`. 

From the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the case where grouping is done by column name(s) using `axis=1`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns using `axis=1`. The function does not correctly process the input when grouping by column name(s), leading to unexpected behavior and KeyErrors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly process the input when grouping by column name(s) using `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Process grouping by column name(s)
    elif axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list if it's not already a list
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # ... (continue with the rest of the function as before)
```

The suggested fix includes adding a specific block of code to handle the case when grouping by column name(s) using `axis=1`. This block of code properly processes the input and ensures correct grouping by column name(s).

With this modification, the function should now handle the grouping by column name(s) using `axis=1` as expected, resolving the issue and allowing the function to pass the failing test.
