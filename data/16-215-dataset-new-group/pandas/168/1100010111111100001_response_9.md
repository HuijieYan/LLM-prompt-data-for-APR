## Issue Analysis
The code is used for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal index mapping for grouping along an axis. The goal is to create Grouping objects, signaling multiple groupers. 

The failing tests suggest that the code is expected to group data from the DataFrame on a given axis and calculate the sum of the groups. The code is failing to process the `group_name` input correctly and raising KeyError 'x' in the `_get_grouper` function.

The potential locations of the bug are in the logic for grouping, creating groups, and the conditions to match levels.

The cause of the bug is that the `groupings` variable is empty, which means that the grouping logic is failing to build appropriate groupings according to the provided `group_name`. Additionally, the check for `not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers` might be incorrectly evaluating to True when it should not be.

## Bug-fix Plan
1. Verify that the keys passed are correctly being converted to a list and the list is accurately used in further group creation.
2. Analyze the logic for creating groupings and ensure that it is correctly interpreting the `group_name` value provided.
3. Check the logic for defining `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, and `any_arraylike` to ensure that it is correctly assessing the input group name for the DataFrame.
4. Ensure that the logic for creating `groupings` is correctly interpreting the `group_name` for the DataFrame provided.
5. Verify that the logic properly interprets the input values and aligns with the expected outcome of the failing tests.

## Bug-fix version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = ensure_categorical(obj[key]) if is_categorical_dtype(obj[key]) else obj[key]

    groupings = []
    if is_list_like(key):
        for value in key:
            groupings.append(Grouping(obj, value, name=value, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True))
    else:
        groupings.append(Grouping(obj, key, name=key, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=False))

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, list(key), obj
```
In this corrected version, the code first verifies whether the `key` needs to be converted to a list. If it does, then it generates a grouping for each key. It also allows the key to be passed as a list, which wasn't a supported functionality in the original version. Finally, the function creates the `groupings` and returns the appropriate result, aligned with the expectations of the failing tests.
