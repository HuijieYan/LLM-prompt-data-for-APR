The code provided looks very barebones and seems to be missing significant blocks of code that come before and after the displayed section. Without the complete code, it is challenging to grasp the complete context, and the extent of the bug can't be fully comprehended.
I would be glad to help you further if you provide the complete block of code so that I can analyze the complete context and pinpoint the cause of the bug.
