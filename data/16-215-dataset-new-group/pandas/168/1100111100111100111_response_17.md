## Recommended strategy for fixing the bug

The bug seems to be related to how the column groupings are handled in the `_get_grouper` function. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the column names when grouping along the specified axis.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to correctly handle the grouping of columns based on the input provided.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Identify the specific areas in the `_get_grouper` function that handle column groupings.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the column names when grouping along the specified axis.
3. Verify the logic for handling column groupings and make any necessary adjustments to resolve the KeyError issue.
4. Test the modified function with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is fixed.

By following these steps, you should be able to correct the bug and address the issue raised on GitHub.

## The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Grouping along the columns
    if key is not None and axis == 1:
        # Check if the key is a single column name
        if is_scalar(key) and key in group_axis:
            key = [key]  # Convert to a list if it's a scalar value
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            raise ValueError("key must be a column name or list of column names")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...
```

In the corrected function, the handling of column groupings for the specified axis is improved to ensure that the correct column names are identified and processed appropriately. This should address the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.

Please note that the above code snippet represents a specific part of the `_get_grouper` function and may need to be integrated into the full function based on the identified error locations and the requirements for proper column grouping.
