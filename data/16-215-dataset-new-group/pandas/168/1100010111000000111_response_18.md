The buggy function _get_grouper has an issue with grouping along columns when using the groupby function with axis=1. This issue is causing a KeyError when trying to group by columns. This bug is confirmed by the failing test function test_groupby_axis_1 provided in the GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

To fix the bug, the _get_grouper function needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by columns when axis=1 is used in the groupby function.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    if axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj.T._get_axis(0)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # check if level is a single level or a list-like object
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    elif axis == 1:
        obj = obj.T
        if level is not None:
            key = level

    # rest of the function remains the same...
    ...
```

With the above changes, the _get_grouper function has been updated to correctly handle the grouping along columns when using the groupby function with axis=1. This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" and pass the failing test function test_groupby_axis_1.
