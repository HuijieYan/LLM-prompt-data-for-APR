Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter to group by columns. The error message indicates that a KeyError is raised when attempting to group by a column name.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_grouper` function does not properly handle the case of grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter. The function incorrectly attempts to treat the column name as an index, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to correctly handle grouping by column names when the `axis=1` parameter is specified.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if key is None and axis == 1:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            try:
                # Get the columns to use for grouping
                if is_list_like(obj.columns):
                    key = obj.columns.tolist()
                else:
                    key = [obj.columns]
            except Exception:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The modification adds a conditional block to handle the case when `key` is None and `axis` is 1. In this case, it retrieves the column names from the DataFrame and sets them as the `key` for grouping.

With this modification, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter.

After making this change, the new version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
