The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is likely causing the failing test case to produce incorrect results. The `group_axis` variable used within the function seems to represent the axis to be grouped along, and the logic for handling the grouping operation might contain some issues. The function appears to incorrectly interpret the `key` parameter for grouping along columns, leading to unexpected behavior.

Based on the failing test case and the runtime values of the variables, it seems that the logic within the function is not correctly handling the column grouping when `axis=1`. The function should correctly interpret the `key` parameter as the column label(s) to group by, and apply the grouping operation accordingly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case when grouping is performed along columns, ensuring that the `key` parameter is interpreted as column label(s) and the grouping operation is applied appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        columns = key
        groupings = [Grouping(obj.columns, columns, obj=obj, in_axis=True)]

    # ... (remaining logic for handling other cases)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this modified version, we explicitly handle the case when `axis=1` and `key` is a list of columns. We create a `Grouping` object using the columns and set `in_axis=True` to indicate that we are grouping along columns.

This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles grouping along columns.

Once you've verified that this modification passes the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub, it can be submitted as a pull request to the pandas repository.
