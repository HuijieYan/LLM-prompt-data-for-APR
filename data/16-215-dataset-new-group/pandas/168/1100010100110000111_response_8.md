## Analysis
The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to group along the columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. This indicates that the function is unable to correctly handle the column names when grouping along the columns. The GitHub issue also confirms the unexpected behavior when trying to group by columns.

The buggy function `_get_grouper` seems to have issues with handling the `key` parameter when grouping along the columns, as it is not correctly handling the column names.

## Bug Cause
The bug is mainly caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when grouping along the columns. It fails to correctly interpret the column names as keys for grouping along the columns, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to perform the groupby operation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The function needs to correctly identify the keys (column names) when grouping along the columns.
2. It should handle the case when `group_axis` is a MultiIndex or non-MultiIndex differently and ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly extracted.
3. It should handle the keys as column names when grouping axis=1.
4. The function should raise a clearer error message or provide proper handling when the keys are not found in the object.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... Existing code ...

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is None:
        gpr = obj[key]  # Get the groupings for the specified key (column name)
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=key,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=False,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    # ... Remaining code ...

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The above fix involves updating how the function handles the `key` parameter for grouping along the columns (`axis=1`). It ensures that the keys are correctly identified and used as column names for grouping. This should resolve the `KeyError` and correctly perform the groupby operation when grouping along the columns.
