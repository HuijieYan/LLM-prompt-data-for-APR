Based on the error messages and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can conclude that the bug lies in the logic where the variable `groupings` is being constructed. Specifically, the variable `keys` contains only a single value for each case, but the subsequent code is based on the assumption that `keys` might have multiple elements, resulting in logic flow issues.

The correction strategy would be to correct the code logic to handle the case when `keys` contains both a single or multiple elements. This can be achieved by safely assuming that the `keys` variable contains iterable elements. Restructuring the grouping creation process to handle both single and multiple keys will address the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    # same input parameters...
):
    # previous code...

    # Begin correction
    if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = list(key)
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # other logic...

    # create the Grouping
    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # create the Grouping based on whether gpr is iterable or not
        for ele in gpr:
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    ele,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=ele,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=in_axis,
                )
                if not isinstance(ele, Grouping)
                else ele
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
    
    # other logic...
    # End correction

    # previous code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function is designed to handle a single key as well as a list of keys correctly.

The corrected version should pass the failing test.

Let me know if you need anything else.
