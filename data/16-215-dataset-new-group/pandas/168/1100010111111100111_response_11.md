```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if level is None:
        level = obj.index.name

    # ... existing code ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
The bug seems to be in the code of the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the handling of the level argument. It appears that the level argument isn't being properly handled, leading to the KeyError.

The corrected version of the function includes an additional check to set the level to the obj.index.name when it is None. This will ensure that the level is properly set and avoids the KeyError.

This fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the function operates as expected.
