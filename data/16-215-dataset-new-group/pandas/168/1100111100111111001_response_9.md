### Code Implementation

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # other code ...

    # what are we after, exactly?
    keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # if this an index replacement?
    if (
        not any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        and not any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)
        and not any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # other code ...
```
The code now checks whether `key` is a string and converts to a list to match the dimension `group_axis`. It then ensures that `any_callable`, `any_arraylike`, and `any_groupers` variables remain `False` and that the keys are interpreted correctly, depending on the type. The match_axis_length variable ensures that the length of keys is the same as the length of group_axis. If the conditions are met, a corrective assignment is made to `keys` using `com.asarray_tuplesafe`. Now, the function should work correctly and return the expected results for the failing test cases.
