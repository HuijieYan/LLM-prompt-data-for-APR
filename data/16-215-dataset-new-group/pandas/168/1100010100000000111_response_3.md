Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition checks for `in_axis, name = False, None` and `if isinstance(gpr, Grouper) and gpr.key is not None` seem to be causing issues in the grouping logic.
2. There are multiple conditions and checks for `if is_in_obj(gpr)` and `elif is_in_axis(gpr)` which might be causing confusion in the grouping process.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is not handling the grouping of columns correctly when `axis=1`. This is leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for grouping by columns and ensure that the function correctly identifies and groups by column names.
2. Remove unnecessary conditions and simplify the logic to ensure clear handling of column grouping.
3. Test with the provided code sample to verify that the issue is resolved.

In the corrected function, the logic for grouping by columns has been simplified and clarified to handle the column grouping correctly when `axis=1`. The unnecessary conditions and complex checks have been removed to ensure clear handling of column names and proper grouping.

This should resolve the issue with grouping by columns on `axis=1` as reported in the GitHub issue.
