The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to occur when there are multiple levels or if the input for the 'key' parameter is a list. These cases are not handled correctly, leading to a KeyError exception. 

The bug seems to occur in the section that handles the `if is_list_like(level):` block and processes to validate the group keys.

The proposed bug fix includes refactoring the part of the code that checks for group keys when the input is a list-like object (e.g., level=[0]). The issue is likely related to how the code attempts to handle different levels and key input combinations, and it should be addressed to improve the behavior.

Here's a proposed fix for the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Check if level is a list-like object and has a single level
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            # Get the key from group_axis based on the level
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
            else:
                level = None
                key = group_axis
        else:
            # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            # (e.g., level=[0])
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

The proposed changes should address the issues related to handling multiple levels and list-like key objects and should resolve the KeyError exception. After making these changes, retesting the scenarios should confirm whether the bug has been fixed.
