The bug in the `_get_grouper` function could be causing the issue reported in the GitHub problem because it is responsible for creating and returning BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.

The bug is likely to be in the logic that handles the grouping along columns (`axis=1`). The function does not properly handle grouping by column names, which is why the `KeyError` is raised when attempting to group by "x".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle grouping by column names correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and not level:
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)

        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

        # create the Grouping for grouping along columns
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            key,
            obj=obj,
            name=key,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [ping], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [key], obj

    # logic for grouping along index remains unchanged
    # ... (existing logic for grouping along index)
```

By adding specific logic for grouping along columns (when `axis=1`), the corrected function should now properly handle grouping by column names and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
