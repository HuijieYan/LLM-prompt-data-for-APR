The bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter and the logic for grouping by columns when `axis=1`. The function is not correctly handling the case when grouping by columns using the `by` parameter, leading to a KeyError as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug seems to be occurring when the function attempts to group by columns by using the `key` parameter. The logic for handling the `key` parameter and the matching of keys with the `group_axis` is not correctly identifying column names and causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the column names or keys for grouping by columns when `axis=1`. Additionally, any logic specific to grouping by columns needs to be properly implemented to avoid the KeyError.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the issue based on the identified bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:  # Check if grouping by columns
        if isinstance(key, str):  # If key is a string, treat it as a column name
            if key not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if the column name is not found
            key = [key]  # Convert the single column name to a list for consistency
        elif isinstance(key, list):  # If key is a list of column names
            for k in key:
                if k not in obj.columns:
                    raise KeyError(k)  # Raise KeyError if any column name in the list is not found
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid key type for grouping by columns")

    # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we added a check specifically for when grouping by columns (`axis=1`) and the `key` parameter is not None. We check if the `key` is a string (single column name) or a list of strings (multiple column names), and raise a KeyError if any of the specified column names are not found in the DataFrame's columns.

By making these changes, the function should correctly handle the grouping by columns and avoid the KeyError as reported in the GitHub issue.
