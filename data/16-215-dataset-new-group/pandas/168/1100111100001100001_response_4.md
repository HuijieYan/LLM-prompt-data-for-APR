The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `level` parameter and the creation of the `groupings` list. The function is trying to categorize the input and create the `groupings` list accordingly, but it's not doing so correctly. Specifically, the function seems to improperly handle multi-index data and has issues with validating the compatibility of the levels with the axis of the object.

In the first case, the input parameter values and the values of relevant variables indicate that the `groupings` list is not computed correctly, which results in an empty list, leading to a `ValueError`. This is due to the if-else block that checks for the `level` parameter and decides whether `isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)` or not. This leads to issues with the subsequent processing and computation of `groupings`.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to thoroughly review and re-implement the logic related to the handling of the `level` parameter and the creation of the `groupings` list. Ensuring that the conditions and branching logic are properly structured to handle the different types of input and to correctly categorize, validate, and create the `groupings` list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function...
```

The corrected function ensures that the conditions are properly structured, and the assignment and processing of `level` and `key` are carried out accurately. This new implementation should address the issues found in the original function and improve its correctness and robustness.
