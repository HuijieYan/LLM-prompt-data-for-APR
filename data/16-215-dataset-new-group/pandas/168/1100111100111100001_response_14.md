The issue with the function `_get_grouper` seems to be at the point where it evaluates the key. When the key is passed as a list, the function treats it as a single key instead of a list of keys. This is evident in the fact that the variable `match_axis_length` remains false even when the `key` is a list with the length equal to the length of the `group_axis`.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle list keys correctly, treating them as a list of keys rather than a single key. This can be achieved by updating the section of the function where it determines what the passed keys are and then creates a Grouping for each one.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # preceding code remains the same...

    # is this an index replacement? Treat list keys correctly
    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and (match_axis_length or isinstance(key, list))  # List key treated correctly
        and level is None
    ):
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # remaining code remains the same...
```

This updates the condition that checks for list keys and correctly sets the `keys` variable as a list when the key is passed as a list, ensuring that it will be treated as a list of keys. This should resolve the issue with passing list keys to the `groupby` function.

This updated version of the function should pass the failing tests.
