Based on the provided information, the issue is related to the `groupby` function and the use of the `axis=1` parameter. The bug seems to be causing a KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the `groupby` function.

The bug seems to be related to the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic that handles the grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The issue seems to stem from the fact that the code is treating the columns as index labels instead of column labels when using `axis=1`.

To fix this bug, the logic within the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the grouping by columns when the `axis=1` parameter is used.

Given the detailed information, a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function can be provided as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    (rest of the function remains the same)
    """

    # Correct the logic to handle grouping by columns when axis=1
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        group_axis = obj.columns
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the grouping by columns when the `axis=1` parameter is used.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function provides the expected output as described in the test cases.
