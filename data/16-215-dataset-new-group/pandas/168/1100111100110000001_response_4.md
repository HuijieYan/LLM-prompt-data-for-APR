The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the processing of the `key` input parameter. When the `group_name` is passed as a list, it triggers an issue leading to a KeyError. The issue seems to be caused by the handling of the input `key` when it's a list.

One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the logic within the function properly handles the case when the `key` parameter is a list. This involves updating the processing of the `key` parameter and its interaction with other parts of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function considering the issue related to processing the `key` parameter when it's a list:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...

    # Original code for validating the key parameter
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # New code for handling key as list in the logic
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # ...

    # Updated logic to handle index replacement for list of keys
    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            # Update to handle list of keys when not all in columns index
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                any([g in obj.columns, g in obj.index.names, g in obj.index]) for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            # Update to handle list of keys for Series
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            # Convert all keys to array-safe representation
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe([key]) for key in keys]
    
    # ...

    # Original code for processing the grouper keys
    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # ...

    # Original logic for creating Grouping objects

    # ...

    # Process the groupings and return the BaseGrouper
    # ...
```

With these updates, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the case when the `key` parameter is passed as a list more effectively, and it should no longer raise a KeyError when a list of keys is provided.

This should address the bug and ensure that the corrected version passes the failing test for the `group_name` parameter being provided as a list.
