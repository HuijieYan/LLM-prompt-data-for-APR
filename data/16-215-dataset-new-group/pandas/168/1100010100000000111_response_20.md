The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_grouper` is not correctly identifying the columns when grouping along the columns axis as indicated by the GitHub issue. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

The issue seems to be related to how the function `_get_grouper` handles grouping by columns. The function needs to correctly identify the columns and perform the grouping operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles grouping by columns. This may involve checking the type of the input key and axis, and adjusting the logic to correctly handle the grouping operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # rest of the function remains the same, with modifications to handle column grouping
    # ...

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when grouping along the columns axis (axis=1) and the key is a string representing a column name. We fetch the corresponding column from the DataFrame `obj` and use it for grouping.

This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report and correctly handle grouping by columns.
