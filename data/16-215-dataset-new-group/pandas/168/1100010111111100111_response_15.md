## Bug Fix

The bug seems to be in how the `key` parameter is handled in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` is a list of column names when grouping along the columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of the `key` parameter to account for both single column names and lists of column names when grouping along the columns.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # In the future, a tuple key will always mean an actual key,
    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide
    # a warning. We can assume that the user wanted a list of keys when
    # the key is not in the index. We just have to be careful with
    # unhashable elements of `key`. Any unhashable elements implies that
    # they wanted a list of keys.
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18314
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    if is_tuple:
        # Convert tuple 'by' to a list of keys
        key = list(key)
        # Issue a warning about interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle both single column names and lists of column names when grouping along the columns, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
