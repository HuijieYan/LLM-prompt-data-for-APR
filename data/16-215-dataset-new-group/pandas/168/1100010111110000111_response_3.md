The issue is related to the `groupby` function in Pandas not allowing implicit selection by column name(s) when using `axis=1`. This is causing a KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the `groupby` method.

### Bug location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_grouper` function in the file `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`. The specific issue is related to how the function handles grouping by column names when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the handling of grouping by column names in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not correctly processing the column names when the `groupby` method is called with `axis=1`, leading to a KeyError.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This may involve updating the logic for handling column names and checking for compatibility with the passed-in axis of the object.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... [rest of the function]

    # Check if the passed key is a string (column name) and axis=1
    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        key = [key]  # Convert the key to a list for proper processing

    # ... [rest of the function]

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we check if the passed key is a string (column name) and the axis is 1. If so, we convert the key to a list for proper processing.

With these changes, the function should now be able to correctly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1` is used.

This fix should resolve the KeyError when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`, as reported in the GitHub issue.
