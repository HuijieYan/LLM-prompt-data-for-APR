The buggy function is causing a KeyError when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. The issue on GitHub suggests that the behavior is unexpected, as the intent is to group by columns based on the column label.

The cause of the bug is primarily in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not handling the grouping by columns properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to group by column names. The issue mentioned in GitHub confirms that the expected behavior should allow grouping by column names.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to handle grouping by columns correctly. It should first check if the grouping is by columns, and then proceed to create the necessary Grouping objects for each column.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:  # Check if grouping by columns
        if not is_list_like(key):  # Ensure key is a list of column names
            key = [key]
        groupings = []
        for col in key:
            if col in obj.columns:
                gpr = obj[col]  # Get the column as the grouper
                ping = Grouping(
                    obj.columns,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=col,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:  # Handle the case of grouping by index (default behavior)
        # Original implementation of _get_grouper
        # ...
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the grouping is by columns (axis=1), and then create Grouping objects for each column in the key. These Grouping objects are then used to create the BaseGrouper for column-based grouping.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `groupby` method to correctly group by column names.
