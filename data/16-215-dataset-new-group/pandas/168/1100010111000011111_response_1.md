The bug in the _get_grouper function is potentially caused by the way the 'key' parameter is being handled. It seems that there may be issues with processing the 'key' parameter as a group axis. This is leading to unexpected behavior in grouping along the columns.

The bug causes the _get_grouper function to fail when trying to group along columns, as demonstrated in the failing test case provided. The expected output is a DataFrame with the index [0, 1, 0] but grouped (and summed) columns [10, 20]. However, the function fails to group along columns as intended, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the key parameter and its handling need to be revised to ensure it correctly processes the grouping along columns.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation remains unchanged until correction for key handling)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Process key to handle grouping along columns
    elif key is not None and axis == 1:
        if obj.columns.name == key:
            binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
            return grouper, {key}, obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

This correction includes specific handling for the 'key' parameter when grouping along the columns. It checks if the 'key' matches the column name and then directly converts it to a Grouper for grouping along the columns.

With this correction, the _get_grouper function should now correctly handle grouping along columns as intended in the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
