The bug is caused by the `match_axis_length` variable always being set to `False`. This variable controls whether the lengths of the keys match the length of the group axis. If the lengths do not match, it should raise a `ValueError`. However, in all the cases provided, `match_axis_length` is set to `False`, indicating that the keys do not match the length of the group axis, yet no error is raised.

To fix the bug, the `match_axis_length` variable should be properly computed based on the lengths of the keys and the group axis. If the lengths do not match, it should raise a `ValueError` with a suitable error message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... [previous function code]

    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if not match_axis_length:
        raise ValueError("Length of keys and group axis must be the same")

    # ... [remaining function code]
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `match_axis_length` variable is calculated correctly based on the lengths of the keys and the group axis. If they do not match, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.
