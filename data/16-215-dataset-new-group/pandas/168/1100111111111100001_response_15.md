Bug cause analysis:

The `_get_grouper` function is returning an incorrect `exclusions` list which led to a `KeyError` being raised in some of the test cases. The issue originates from a logic bug in the following section of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
    if not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
```
This condition block is intended to handle an index replacement scenario, but it's not handling it accurately.

Fix strategy:
The issue might be resolved by revising the logic inside the condition block to correctly handle index replacement.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # ... other lines of code
    
    # is this an index replacement?
    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]
    
    # ... remaining lines of code
```

With this change, the corrected function should no longer raise a `KeyError` for the failing test cases provided. Always run the updated function comprehensively against a varied set of test cases covering different scenarios to ensure that it adequately addresses the bug.
