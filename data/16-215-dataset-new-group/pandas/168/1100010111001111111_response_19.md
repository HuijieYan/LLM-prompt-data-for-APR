The function `_get_grouper` is failing to group the DataFrame correctly when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This leads to unexpected KeyError exceptions when attempting to group by columns.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the "group by columns" case correctly and is not properly identifying and processing the keys for grouping when the axis is set to 1.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the "group by columns" case when `axis=1` is specified. This includes identifying and processing the keys for grouping, and ensuring that the groupings are correctly formed based on the specified columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if is_list_like(key):
            keys = key
        else:
            keys = [key]

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for col in keys:
            group = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                col,
                obj=obj,
                name=col,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(group)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    else:
        # Rest of the original code for axis != 1 remains same
``` 

In the corrected version, when the `axis=1` parameter is specified, the function now correctly handles the "group by columns" case by creating Grouping objects for each specified column, and then forming the BaseGrouper using these groupings.

This modification should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles the "group by columns" case when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter.
