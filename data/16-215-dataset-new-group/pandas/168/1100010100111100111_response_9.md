## Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs because the function `_get_grouper` does not handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list correctly. When the `key` parameter is a list, the function should process each element of the list as a separate key for grouping, but it seems to be treating the entire list as a single key instead.

This bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when the `key` parameter is a list, as the function is not processing the list correctly and is trying to look up the entire list as a single key, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to properly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list. It should iterate over each element of the list and create a `Grouping` object for each key, and then combine them into a `BaseGrouper`.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            group = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(group)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (existing code)
```

With this modification, the function will properly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list, creating a `Grouping` object for each key and then combining them into a `BaseGrouper`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and handle the grouping by column name(s) as expected.
