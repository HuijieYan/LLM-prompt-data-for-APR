Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the function `_get_grouper` not correctly handling the grouping by columns when the `axis=1`. We need to modify the function to properly handle column grouping.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the logic for handling column grouping in the `_get_grouper` function. It is failing to properly identify the columns to be used for grouping when `axis=1`, which results in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles column grouping and ensure that it correctly identifies and extracts the columns for grouping when `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function implementation)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if is_list_like(key):
            keys = key
        else:
            keys = [key]
        
        group_axis = obj[key]
        
        groupings = []
        for col in keys:
            groupings.append(Grouping(
                group_axis,
                group_axis[col],
                obj=obj,
                name=col,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            ))

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        elif len(groupings) == 0:
            groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (existing logic for other cases, unchanged)

```

In the corrected version, we added a specific check for `axis=1` and `key is not None`, and modified the logic to extract the columns for grouping from the DataFrame based on the provided `key`. We then create the necessary `Grouping` objects and proceed with the grouping as before.

This corrected version should now properly handle column grouping when `axis=1`, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
