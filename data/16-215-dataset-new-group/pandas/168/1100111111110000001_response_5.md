The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is that it is not handling the case when the `key` parameter is a list. When `group_name` is passed as a list, the `groupby` operation is failing.

The `group_name` parameter can be either a string or a list. The `_get_grouper` function should be able to handle both scenarios.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that can handle both scenarios:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # is this an index replacement?
    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and level is None
    ):
        keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
            if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
                in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
                exclusions.append(name)
            # ... (rest of the loop remains the same)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this change, the `_get_grouper` function is now able to handle both string and list inputs for the `group_name` parameter, and the failing test should pass with this corrected function.
