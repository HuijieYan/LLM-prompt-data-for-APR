The main issue in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be with handling the `group_name` parameter when it's a list. The code treats it as a single key, whereas it should be treated as a list of keys when it's passed as a list. This causes the KeyError when attempting to use it as a group name, as it tries to access a single key instead of a list.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function body)

    # Assume the group name should be a list if it's not None
    if group_name is not None and not isinstance(group_name, list):
        group_name = [group_name]

    # ... (rest of the function)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `group_name` is treated as a list if it's not already, which should resolve the KeyError issue.

Let me know if you need any additional assistance!
