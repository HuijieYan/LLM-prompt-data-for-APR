The error in the function lies in multiple places. The main issue appears to be with handling the `key` parameter when it's a list of keys instead of a single key. The function is not handling the case when `key` is a list properly. It throws a `KeyError` when `key` is a list.

The buggy function should handle the `key` parameter differently when it's a list to ensure that it works properly for both single values and lists of keys. Additionally, the function should also correctly handle the case when `key` is a tuple.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to check the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. If `key` is a list, then process each key in the list separately and if it's a tuple, interpret it as a list of keys. This will ensure that the function handles single keys, lists of keys, and tuples of keys correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers.
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # Process each key in the list separately
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, _ = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False
            )
            groupings.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ... (The same code as the original function)
    # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `key` parameter is processed differently based on its type. If it's a list or tuple, the function processes each key separately and then combines the results into a single `BaseGrouper`. This approach ensures that the function can handle both single keys and lists/tuples of keys correctly.
