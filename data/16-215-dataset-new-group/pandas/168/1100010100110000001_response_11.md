The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is causing a `KeyError` when passing a list of keys instead of a single key. The function has logic to handle a single key, but it's not properly handling a list of keys.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle a list of keys. We also need to ensure that the function executes without errors when a list of keys is passed to the `groupby` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # ... (existing code)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            # Rest of the inner block remains the same
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            # Rest of the inner block remains the same

    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = list(key) if isinstance(key, tuple) else key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        if match_axis_length:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

            if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
                levels = list(level)
            else:
                levels = [level] * len(keys)

            for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
                # ... (existing code)

    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False  # Adjusted for a single key

        # ... (existing code)

    # ... (rest of the existing code)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle both single keys and lists of keys without raising a `KeyError` when invoking the `groupby` function.

With this fix, the function will successfully handle groupings by both single key values and lists of key values without errors.
