The issue with the `_get_grouper` function is that when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a single string, it is not being handled correctly to group along the specified axis. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to perform the grouping along the columns.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where `group_name` is provided as a single string, which should correspond to the columns name when grouping along the axis 1. This situation is not being properly accounted for in the logic of the `_get_grouper` function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle a single string `group_name` passed as the key when grouping along the axis. The function should identify the grouping key as the column name (in this case), and then perform the grouping accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if axis == 1:
            key = key  # Ensure key is the column name when grouping along the columns
        elif axis == 0:
            key = obj.index  # Use the index as the key when grouping along the index

    # ... (existing code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
This modification ensures that when `group_name` is provided as a string and the grouping is along the axis 1, the `key` variable is set as the name of the column.

By applying this fix, the function should correctly handle the case where `group_name` is a single string, and the grouping should be performed based on the specified column in the DataFrame. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
