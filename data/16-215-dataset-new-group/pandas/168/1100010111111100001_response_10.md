The bug in the provided function `_get_grouper` seems to stem from the `keys` variable and how it is computed using the `key` input parameter. The variable `keys` should be a list of keys or a single key represented as a list when `key` is a tuple to ensure compatibility with subsequent processes. Also, we should ensure that it is a list whenever it is not already. We can achieve this by coercing the `key` to a list where needed.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, I infer that the variable `keys` is not correctly constructed from the `key`. It should be a list containing the keys, but in the current implementation, for single-key cases, it is a single value instead of a list. This causes issues during subsequent processing.

A simple strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that `keys` is always a list even if `key` is a single key. This would involve explicitly checking if `key` is a list, and if not, converting it to a list before assigning it to `keys`.

Here's a corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True
):
    # ... previous code
    
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else list(key)

    # ... subsequent code with corrections
```

Applying this change ensures that the `keys` variable is always a list, and will resolve issues related to subsequent processing. After making this change, verify its correctness by running the failing test cases.
