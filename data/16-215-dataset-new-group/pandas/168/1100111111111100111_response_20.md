To fix the buggy function, the following changes can be made:

1. Remove the unnecessary variable "level" since its value is always set to `None` in the current implementation.
2. Refactor the loop to handle the groupings correctly and improve the conditional checks within the loop.
3. Update the logic to handle axis-based groupings, especially when grouping along columns.
4. Improvements can be made to the error-checking logic to correctly identify KeyError situations.
5. Ensure that the function correctly handles the case when the key parameter is a list.

Here's the corrected version of the function based on the identified issues:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide

                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Reassign the value of group_axis for proper handling of axis-based groupings
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Iterate through the keys to create the groupings
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    for gpr in keys:
        # Handle groupings when the key is in the index or columns
        if gpr in group_axis:

        # Create the Grouping object based on the type of key being used
        grouping = Grouping(
            axis=group_axis,
            name=gpr,
            obj=obj,
            in_axis=in_axis,

        groupings.append(grouping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle axis-based groupings more effectively and should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
