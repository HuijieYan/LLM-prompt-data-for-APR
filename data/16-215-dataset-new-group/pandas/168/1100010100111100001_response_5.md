The issue derives from the fact that the input parameter `key` is expected to be a scalar, but when it's a list, the function doesn't validate it correctly and raises a KeyError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to always operate as if `key` is a list. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        level = [level]

    keys = ensure_categorical(key)
    outside, in_axis = com._ensure_key_mapped(obj, keys, axis)
    
    if len(outside) > 0:
        warnings.warn(
            "Categorical dtype grouper for axis 0 is not"
            "  the catgory dtype 'category' is expected"
        )

    exclusive = com.sorter_exclusivity(obj, grouped, axis=axis)
    result = com.get_group_index(obj, key)
    return result, exclusivity, obj
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle both scalar input and list input for the `key` parameter. The modified part ensures that the length of the keys is preserved, and they are treated as an iterable in the subsequent processing.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with KeyError being raised when the `key` parameter is a list.
