The root cause of the issue is that the `level` variable is being assigned `None` unconditionally before being used. This likely causes problems in the subsequent process of creating a Grouping for this level.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure the `level` is properly assigned based on particular conditions of the provided input to the `_get_grouper` function. We should avoid unconditionally assigning `None` to `level` if the input falls under a certain condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation of the function)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # ... (remaining implementation of the function)
```

By applying this change, the function will properly handle the `level` variable based on the condition provided in the input parameters. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.

Note: The actual correct implementation of the function might need further adjustments based on the exact requirements and use cases.
