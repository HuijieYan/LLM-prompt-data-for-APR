# The bug
The `_get_grouper` function attempts to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping for creating grouper indexers. However, there is an issue with handling multiple levels of keys when dealing with a `MultiIndex`. The condition that checks for a length-one `level` in the `MultiIndex` has a logical issue, as it treats the `level` differently from a list of length-one, which results in errors when validating the key with the `group_axis`.

# The strategy to fix the bug
The function needs to handle the `level` and `key` in a manner that is consistent across both `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` cases. This will involve removing unnecessary conditions and ensuring the appropriate handling of the `level` and `key` when dealing with a `MultiIndex`.

# The corrected implementation
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
   # ... existing implementation ...

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
            if len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

        # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
        # (e.g., level=[0])
        # GH 13901
        if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        # assign value to key
        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
        level = None

        # Handle the case where the key length is 1
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... rest of the implementation ...
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the `level` and `key` are handled consistently for `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` cases.

This corrected implementation should pass the failing test.
