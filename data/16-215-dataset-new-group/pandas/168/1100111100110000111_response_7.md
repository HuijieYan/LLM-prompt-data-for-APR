## Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub states that when grouping by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter, a KeyError is raised even if the column name is valid.

The error message from the failing test shows that the KeyError is raised when trying to group by the name 'x'. This indicates that there is a problem with the logic in the `_get_grouper` function when processing the key for columns. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the key when it is a list of column names.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_get_grouper` function not handling column names correctly when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. This is causing the KeyError to be raised, as the function is unable to properly process the column names for grouping.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_grouper` function correctly handles column names when grouping by columns using the `axis=1` parameter. The function should be modified to appropriately process the key for column names, handle the case when `key` is a list of column names, and avoid raising a KeyError in this scenario.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing implementation)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle grouping by columns with the key as a list of column names
    if key is not None and axis == 1 and isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for col_name in keys:
            if col_name in obj:
                grouping = Grouping(group_axis, obj[col_name], obj=obj, name=col_name)
                groupings.append(grouping)
                exclusions.append(col_name)
            else:
                raise KeyError(col_name)

        # create the BaseGrouper for grouping by columns
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (remaining existing implementation)
```

The above modification specifically handles the case when `key` is a list of column names and creates groupings accordingly. This should resolve the issue and prevent the KeyError from being raised when grouping by columns.

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function provided above should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
