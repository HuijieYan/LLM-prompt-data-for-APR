## Bugs in the buggy function

1. The conditional statement to check if `is_tuple` is `True` to convert `key` to a list is not correctly handling multiple entries. 

2. The program uses an incorrect condition to match the axis length with keys.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. The function should identify how to handle a tuple `key`, i.e. a warning should be issued to advise the user to use `by=[...]` instead of `by=(...)`. The program should convert an unhashable tuple into a list of keys, before inspecting the elements.

2. The last if condition should be thoroughly checked, and the handling should be modified as required. 

3. The condition for `match_axis_length` should be updated if necessary to correctly handle the length comparison of `match_axis_length`.

## A possible fix of the bug in the function

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues to handle tuple keys, and correctly matches the axis length with keys.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    ...

    # In the future, a tuple key will always mean an actual key,
    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide
    # a warning. We can assume that the user wanted a list of keys when
    # the key is not in the index. We just have to be careful with
    # unhashable elements of `key`. Any unhashable elements implies that
    # they wanted a list of keys.
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18314
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(e) for e in key)
    
    if is_tuple:
        if all_hashable:
            key = list(key)
        else:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    # ...
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ...
    
```

This updated implementation corrects the logic of the function to handle tuple keys and match the axis length with keys correctly.
