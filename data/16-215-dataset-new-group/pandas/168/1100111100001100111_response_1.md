The problem with the buggy function lies in the grouping logic when the `axis` value is set to 0 or 1. The function mistakenly handles the case of grouping by the column name or a list of column names. This results in an incorrect grouping, leading to unexpected errors, such as raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, the logic for handling the grouping by column name or list of column names needs to be revised. It should correctly handle the case where the `axis` is set to 1 and the grouping should be performed by the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # Grouping by a list of column names
            keys = key
            groupings = []

            for col in keys:
                groupings.append(
                    Grouping(
                        obj.columns,  # Grouping by columns
                        obj[col],  # Selecting the column
                        obj=obj,
                        name=col,
                        level=None,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                )

            # create the internals grouper
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, [], obj

        else:
            # Grouping by a single column name
            keys = [key]
            groupings = [
                Grouping(
                    obj.columns,  # Grouping by columns
                    obj[key],  # Selecting the column
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=None,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            ]

            # create the internals grouper
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, [], obj

    # The remaining logic for grouping by index or other cases remains unchanged
    # ...

```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the `axis` value is 1 and handles the case where the `key` parameter is a single column name or a list of column names. It creates the appropriate Grouping object(s) for the column(s) and constructs the BaseGrouper accordingly.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub report, allowing proper grouping by column name or list of column names when the `axis` value is set to 1.
