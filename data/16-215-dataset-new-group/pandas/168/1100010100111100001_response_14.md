The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing because it uses a condition to check if `key` is `baseGrouper`, and if itâ€™s not, it flattens the input key from `tuple` to `list`. However, when the value of the key is already a `list`, this flattening process occurs redundantly.

By analyzing the runtime input/output and potential error locations, the bug is revealed. The error message reports that a `KeyError: 'x'` is raised at the `is_in_axis(gpr)` function call. This suggests that the `key` parameter should already be a list since the function calls `is_tuple`. On the second failing test, when `key` is set as a list, it flattens the input key from `tuple` to `list`. This redundancy results in making the outer list nested, which causes the KeyError.

The bug can be fixed by reassigning `keys` if `key` is not already a list. This can be implemented by adding a check to see if `key` is not already a list, then reassign `keys` to `key`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # previous code ...

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    
    # reassign keys if key is not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # remaining code ...
    # make any other necessary changes to the code

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This will ensure that the `keys` variable only contains a single list and not a nested or redundant one.
