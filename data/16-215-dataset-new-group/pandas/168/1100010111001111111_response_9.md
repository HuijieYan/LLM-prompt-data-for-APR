Based on the test case and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the `_get_grouper` function is not correctly handling the axis parameter when grouping by column names. The function is not effectively grouping along the columns and producing the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the column names when `axis=1` and grouping by column names.

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to correctly identify and group by column names when `axis=1` is set. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function properly processes the column names and aligns the grouping process with the expected behavior when grouping along columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        raise ValueError("Invalid group key for axis=1, must be string or list of strings.")

    if key is not None and axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj[key]  # Group by specified columns
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)  # Default behavior: group by index

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that when `axis=1` and a single string is provided as the key, it is converted into a list of strings. It also verifies that the provided key is a string or a list of strings when `axis=1`.

These changes address the issue described in the failing test case and align the behavior with the expected output provided in the GitHub issue.
