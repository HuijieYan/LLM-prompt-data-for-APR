The issue with the `_get_grouper` function is related to the initial setup of the `keys` variable, which refers to the input parameter `key`. When the value of `key` is a list, the `keys` variable is set to the input `key`, but later on, it tries to access individual elements of `keys`, assuming that `key` should be a single key if it's a list. This leads to errors and unexpected behavior.

The bug is caused due to the following variables:

1. `keys`: When the input parameter `key` is a list, it's directly assigned to `keys`. However, in subsequent logic, the function assumes `key` should be a single key.
2. `match_axis_length`: It's not being set correctly based on the conditions.

To fix this, we should handle the case of a list of keys correctly and set the `match_axis_length` variable appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Other import statements

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # Rest of the existing code
    # No need to change other parts of the code

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, I've added a check for `key` being a list and assigned it to `keys`. Then `match_axis_length` is set based on the length of `keys` compared to `group_axis`. This ensures that the function correctly handles the case when `key` is a list of keys.

These changes should address the issue and lead to the expected behavior of the `_get_grouper` function.
