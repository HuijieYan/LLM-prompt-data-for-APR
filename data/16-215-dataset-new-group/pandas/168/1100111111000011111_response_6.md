The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing the `groupby` operation to fail when using the `axis=1` parameter to group by columns. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and is causing a KeyError when trying to group by columns using their labels. The issue has been reported on GitHub.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles the groupings and exclusions when processing the axis parameter. It seems that the function does not correctly handle grouping by column labels when using the `axis=1` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic of the `_get_grouper` function, especially the parts related to processing the `axis` parameter and handling the groupings and exclusions. The function needs to properly identify and create the groupings for column labels when grouping along the axis, and ensure that the output is consistent with the expected behavior for `groupby`.


Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import BaseGrouper, Grouping
from pandas.core.dtypes.inference import is_categorical_dtype

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        keys = [group_axis]
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        for gpr in keys
    ]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

Please replace the original `_get_grouper` function with this corrected version.

The corrected function should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `groupby` operation using the `axis=1` parameter works as expected, grouping the DataFrame based on the column labels.
