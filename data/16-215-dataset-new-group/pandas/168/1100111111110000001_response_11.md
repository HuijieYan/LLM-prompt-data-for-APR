The cause of the bug is that the `_get_grouper` function in the original pandas library is not handling the case where `key` is a list correctly. This can be seen from the failing test in the `test_groupby_axis_1` function, where `group_name` is a list `["x"]`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where `key` is a list properly, instead of treating it as a single key. Additionally, we need to update the `is_tuple` condition to check if `key` is a list and then handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # In the future, a list of keys will always mean a list of actual keys.
    # We need to handle the list of keys properly in this block.
    is_list_of_keys = isinstance(key, list)
    if is_list_of_keys:
        # Ensure that all elements in the list are hashable
        all_hashable = all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)
        if all_hashable:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        else:  # key contains unhashable elements
            msg = (
                "Interpreting list of keys as a list of actual keys. Use 'key=(...)' if a single key is intended."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

```

With this corrected version, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the list `key` correctly and avoid the `KeyError` when trying to group by a list of keys.

By applying these changes, the `_get_grouper` function will be able to accept a list of keys when creating the Grouping objects, and it will pass the failing test cases that expect `group_name` to be a list.

I expect this corrected version of `_get_grouper` to resolve the KeyErrors observed in the failing test cases.
