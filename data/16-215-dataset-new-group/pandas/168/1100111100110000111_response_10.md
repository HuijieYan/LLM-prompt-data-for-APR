## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It handles the passing in references and creates a `Grouping` for each one, combined into a `BaseGrouper`.

The error message indicates a KeyError when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter, which is used for grouping along the columns. This results in an error when trying to group by the columns name(s).

The GitHub issue confirms the problem, stating that when using `groupby` with `axis=1` for grouping along the columns, it raises a KeyError even though the intent is to group by the columns name.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error could be in the section where the function checks for column names ('by') and attempts to interpret it as a list of keys rather than a single key.

## Bug Cause
The bug likely occurs due to a mishandling of the 'by' parameter when attempting to group along the columns. It may be interpreting the 'by' parameter incorrectly as an actual key when it should be treated as a list of keys for grouping along the columns.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, I will modify the handling of the 'by' parameter when grouping along the columns (axis=1). It should correctly interpret the 'by' parameter as a list of keys, rather than a single key. This will ensure that when grouping along the columns, it accurately processes the column names as a list of keys for grouping.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous function body)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        if key is not None:
            keys = [key]  # if key is not None, treat it as a list of keys
        else:
            keys = []
    else:
        keys = key

    # ... (previous function body)
```

In the corrected function, the handling of the 'by' parameter is modified to ensure that if it is not already a list, it is treated as a list of keys for grouping. This change will address the misinterpretation of the 'by' parameter and resolve the KeyError issue when using `groupby` with `axis=1` for grouping along the columns.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
