Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function within the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The problem occurs when trying to group by column names using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. It raises a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the column names.

The bug is that the function doesn't handle grouping by column names correctly when `axis=1`. The issue is confirmed by the failing test, the error message, and the details provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling grouping by column names in the `_get_grouper` function to ensure that it correctly processes the grouping by column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is None and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

The change I made is to add a check for `level is None` and `isinstance(key, str)` to handle the case where `key` is a column name (string). If these conditions are met, it means that the grouping is by a column name, and we convert the `key` to the actual column values from the DataFrame.

With this modification, the function should correctly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This should resolve the `KeyError` and make the function work as expected.

By implementing this fix, the `groupby` function should now work correctly when grouping by column names using `axis=1`, as per the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.
