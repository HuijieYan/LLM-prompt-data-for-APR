The issue seems to be caused by the `key` parameter being passed as a string in some cases and as a list in others, which is not properly handled. This inconsistency in the input data is causing the function to throw a KeyError because it's unable to handle the list input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is always handled consistently, regardless of whether it is provided as a string or list. We can do this by modifying the logic around `key` within the `_get_grouper` function. Specifically, we should check whether the `key` parameter is a string or list, and then handle it as necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (function logic)

    # Ensure key is always handled as a list
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    # Continue with the rest of the function logic
    # ...

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    # ... (rest of the function)
```

With this modification, the `key` parameter will always be transformed into a list, ensuring that the function can consistently handle its input. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle both string and list input for the `key` parameter.

After making these changes, the provided test cases and relevant error messages should pass without throwing a KeyError.
