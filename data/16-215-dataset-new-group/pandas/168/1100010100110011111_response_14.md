The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causes a KeyError when using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` even though "x" is a column name. The bug lies in the handling of the `key` parameter and failure to appropriately handle grouping by column names.

The `_get_grouper` function should be updated to correctly handle grouping by column names and to avoid raising a KeyError in such cases.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file, which addresses the issue and should pass the failing test case.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Create and return BaseGrouper, an internal mapping for creating the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers.

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as: index mappings, 
    keys to columns, functions, or Groupers. Groupers enable local references to 
    axis, level, sort, while the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing-in references are and then 
    creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

    If observed and we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

        for k in key:
