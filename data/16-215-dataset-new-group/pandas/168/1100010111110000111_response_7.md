From the test and error message, it is clear that the issue arises when using the `groupby()` function with the `axis=1` parameter. The error occurs when trying to group the DataFrame by a column name, as it raises a KeyError even though the column name should be a valid grouping key.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_grouper` is unable to correctly process the column names when using `axis=1` for grouping. This leads to an error when trying to group by column names.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # logic to handle grouping by index
    if axis == 0:
        # Handle grouping by index as it is
        return obj._groupby(key=key, axis=axis)

    # logic to handle grouping by columns
    if axis == 1:
        axis_values = [obj.columns.get_loc(col) for col in key]
        return obj._groupby(key=axis_values, axis=axis)
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the grouping axis is 0 or 1. If the axis is 0, it handles the grouping by index using `obj._groupby()`. If the axis is 1, it gets the locations of the column names and then uses `obj._groupby()` to handle the grouping by columns.

This updated logic should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the function to correctly handle grouping by column names when using `axis=1`. This should also enable the test function provided to pass successfully.
