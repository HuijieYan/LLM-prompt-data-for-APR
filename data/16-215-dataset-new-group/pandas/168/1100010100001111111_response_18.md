## Correction

The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. The function should correctly handle single keys, lists of keys, and strings when grouping by columns. Based on the provided cases and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be around the handling of `key` when grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle all the cases of `key` parameter correctly when grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... [The rest of the function remains unchanged]
    if level is not None:
        # ... [The rest of the if block as is]
    else:
        if is_list_like(key):
            nkeys = len(key)
            if nkeys == 1:
                key = key[0]
            elif nkeys == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple keys only valid with MultiIndex")
        
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if axis == 0 and obj.index.name != key:
                raise ValueError(
                    "key name {} is not the name of the index".format(key)
                )
            elif axis == 1 and key not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(key)
                
        # ... [Rest of the function remains unchanged]
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `key` parameter is correctly handled when grouping by columns, allowing for single keys, lists of keys, and strings to be used as expected. This should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as address the issue reported on GitHub.
