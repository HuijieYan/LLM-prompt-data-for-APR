## Bug Fix

The issue seems to be related to the inability to group by columns using the `groupby` method in Pandas. To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified. Based on the provided information and the failing test cases, a potential bug is the `keys` assignment and the subsequent logic based on the length of `keys`.

A potential fix involves modifying the `keys` variable to handle the case when key is an instance of list and checking for column names in the DataFrame's Index. I would suggest the following approach to fix the bug:

1. Check if `key` is an instance of list-like (eg., list or tuple).
2. If `key` is list-like, then iterate over the keys and check if each key is present in the column names of the DataFrame.
3. If the key is present, add it to the `keys` list.
4. Perform the grouping based on the `keys`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other function logic remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = []
        for k in key:
            if k in obj.columns:
                keys.append(k)
        if not keys:
            raise KeyError("None of the keys are present in the columns")
    elif isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # (remaining logic remains unchanged)
    
    # (remaining logic remains unchanged)
```

This fix checks each key in the input list against the column names of the DataFrame and adds the valid keys to the `keys` list. If none of the keys are present in the columns, a `KeyError` is raised, as a list of keys is expected for grouping by columns.

This should resolve the issue and allow the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle grouping by columns using the `groupby` method.

I hope the provided fix helps in addressing the bug and resolves the GitHub issue related to the unexpected behavior of the `groupby` method for grouping by columns in Pandas.
