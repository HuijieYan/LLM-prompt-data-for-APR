Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the function `_get_grouper` is not correctly interpreting the column name when `axis=1`. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the group name correctly when `axis=1` is specified. It fails to interpret the group name as a list of keys for columns, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the group name when `axis=1`. We need to ensure that the function correctly interprets the group name as a list of keys for columns and creates the appropriate BaseGrouper.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    if level is not None and axis == 1:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the group name when `axis=1`, allowing the `groupby` operation to work as expected.

This fix is based on the assumption that the group name should be interpreted as a list of keys for columns when `axis=1`. By modifying the logic to handle this specific case, the bug can be resolved.

After making this change, the `_get_grouper` function should be able to correctly interpret the group name when `axis=1`, addressing the KeyError issue and resolving the bug.
