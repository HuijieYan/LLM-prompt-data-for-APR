## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs when the `_get_grouper` function tries to create a `BaseGrouper` object for grouping based on columns, but it fails to do so. As a result, it raises a `KeyError` when attempting to group by columns. This is not the expected behavior, as the function should successfully group by columns as well.

The bug seems to be related to the section of the code that handles the creation of `BaseGrouper` for grouping by columns. The variable `group_axis` is expected to represent the axis to be grouped, but it seems that the function is not handling the grouping by columns appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Update the logic to correctly identify and handle the grouping by columns.
2. Check the conditions for column grouping and ensure that the appropriate operations are performed for grouping by columns.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    if axis == 0:
        group_axis = obj.index
    else:
        group_axis = obj.columns

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The corrected function above includes an update to the logic for handling the `axis` parameter to correctly identify and handle the grouping by columns.

With this fix, the function should be able to successfully group by columns as well, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
