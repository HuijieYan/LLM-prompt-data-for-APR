## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The variable `key` is being used for multiple purposes and may cause confusion.
2. The `if-else` block for checking `level` and `group_axis` can be simplified to remove redundant code.
3. The conditions for checking `level` and its compatibility with the object's axis may need to be revised.
4. The handling of a tuple key needs to be reviewed to ensure correct interpretation and warning generation.
5. The `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions may have issues with correctly identifying the presence of keys and groupers.

## Cause of the bug

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `groupby` function when grouping along columns. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns, even though the intention is to group by the "x" column label.

The `groupby` function in the buggy code seems to have issues with interpreting the keys and identifying column names, leading to the KeyError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Revise the logic for handling the `key` variable to ensure it is used consistently and clearly for different types of keys (single, tuple, list).
2. Simplify the code for checking `level` and its compatibility with the object's axis.
3. Review the handling of tuple keys and ensure correct interpretation and warning generation.
4. Verify the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions to accurately identify the presence of keys and groupers.
