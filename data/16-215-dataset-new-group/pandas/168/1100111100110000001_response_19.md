The bug in the provided function seems to be due to the conditional check for the `key` variable. This is leading to a 'KeyError' when the 'key' variable is passed as a list when calling the function. The function is designed to handle the 'key' variable differently based on its type, but this doesn't seem to be fully implemented, which is leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks for the `key` variable and ensure that the function handles the key correctly whether it is a list or a single value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """

    # rest of the function body remains the same

    # Convert the 'key' to a list if it's not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # rest of the function body remains the same

    # rest of the function body remains the same
```
With this correction, the function should be able to handle both single values and lists for the `key` parameter and the error should be resolved.
