The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `key` parameter when it's a list. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to handle a list of keys as a single key, which results in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling a list of keys needs to be revised so that the keys are properly iterated over and processed individually.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # (previous code for handling level)

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        results = []
        exclusions = set()
        for k in key:
            res, excl, obj = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate)
            results.append(res)
            if isinstance(excl, set):
                exclusions |= excl
            else:
                exclusions.add(excl)  # Assuming that each exclusion is a unique value
        return results, exclusions, obj

    # rest of the original code...

    # (remaining logic remains unchanged)

```

In the corrected version, when `key` is a list, the function iterates through each element of the list and processes them individually. The results are aggregated into a list and the exclusions are stored as a set to avoid duplicate entries.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
