The potential error in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be in the section where it checks for the level and key for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex instances. Additionally, there are potential issues with the processing of `level` and `key` variables, as well as the handling of grouper types and validation.

The bug seems to be causing issues when attempting to group along the columns (`axis=1`), as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `level` and `key` variables for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex instances. Additionally, the processing of grouper types needs to be reviewed, and the grouper validation logic might need improvement.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
                
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This corrected version should address the issues with grouping along the columns as reported in the GitHub issue. However, further testing may be necessary to ensure that the bug is fully resolved.
