### Summary:
The `_get_grouper` function contains a bug causing it to return a KeyError when the `key` parameter is a list, since it is only being interpreted as a single key. To fix this, the bug needs to be identified and corrected in the function. 

The function takes several parameters, which are used to compose a `group_axis` by gathering the passed-in references and then creating a `Grouping` for each one. This routine constructs the groupings, which are combined into a `BaseGrouper`. The returned variables should match the expected return values and types to ensure that the provided test cases will pass.

Upon analysis of the cases, the problem appears to be the condition that handles when the `key` parameter is a list. The function must check for this condition and iterate through each item in the list to create the groupings.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is located within the if-else statement when only a single element is being considered as a key, and the condition matches the axis' length.

### Solution:
Change the condition to handle the case when `key` is a list to correctly create the groupings for each item in the list.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
# Buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the code)
    if level is not None:
        # ... (rest of the code)

    # ... (rest of the code)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        for key in keys:
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    key,
                    obj=obj,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True
                )
            )
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
        groupings.append(
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                key,
                obj=obj,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
        )
    # ... (rest of the code)
```
