The bug in the given function seems to be related to how the variables `keys` and `match_axis_length` are being derived from the input `key` and `group_axis` and how they are used later in the function.

The expected values for `keys` and `match_axis_length` in the two cases are conflicting, and we need to resolve that by checking and manipulating the `key` and `group_axis` variables appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Check for MultiIndex and set appropriate level
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Handling level for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            # Handling level if it's a string or an integer
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function (omitted for brevity)

    keys = [key] if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function (omitted for brevity)

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Rest of the function (omitted for brevity)

    # Rest of the function (omitted for brevity)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function, we have addressed the handling of the `key` variable and derived the `keys` and `match_axis_length` variables based on the corrected handling. This should resolve the conflicting expectations for different cases.
