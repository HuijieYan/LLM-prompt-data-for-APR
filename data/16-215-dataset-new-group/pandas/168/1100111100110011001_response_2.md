The issue seems to be occurring due to incorrect processing of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. The `is_tuple` and `all_hashable` variables are not being handled correctly, which is leading to an incorrect value for the `keys` variable. This incorrect value for `keys` then leads to errors in the subsequent processing of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the `key` parameter and its transformation into the `keys` variable as well as the `is_tuple` and `all_hashable` variables. We should also check for the condition where the `key` is a list and handle it appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # (remaining code remains the same)

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(map(is_hashable, key))

    if is_tuple and (all_hashable or set(key).issubset(obj)):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...] instead of 'by=(...)'."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        keys = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(obj._get_axis(axis))
    
    # (remaining code remains the same)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With these fixes, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the `key` parameter and return the expected values for the given test cases.
