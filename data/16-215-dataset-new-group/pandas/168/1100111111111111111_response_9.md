    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    if axis == 1:  # check if the grouping is along the columns
        if key and isinstance(key, str):  # check if a single key is passed as string
            key = [key]  # convert the single key to a list
    else:  # if grouping along the index or other operations
        if key and isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # check if a single key is passed as a list
            key = key[0]  # convert the single key from list to a string

    # rest of the function body remains unchanged
