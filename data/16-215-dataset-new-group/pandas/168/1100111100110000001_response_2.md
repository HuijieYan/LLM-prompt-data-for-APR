The root cause of the bug comes from the way the grouper is being handled when 'group_name' is a list with a single item. The code is not properly handling this scenario and is throwing a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle the case when 'group_name' is a list with a single item.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 1: # If key is a list with a single item
            key = key[0]  # Assign the single item to key

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

```

With this fix, the _get_grouper function should now handle the case where 'group_name' is a list with a single item, and it should pass the failing test cases.
