## Fixing the bug

The root cause of the bug is that when the `key` parameter is provided as a list, the function is not correctly handling the case of grouping by column names when the input is `axis=1`. This results in a `KeyError` being raised when the code attempts to group by the column names. To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly handle the case of `key` being a list of column names and ensure that the grouping is applied correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        # Handle levels for non-MultiIndex
        else:
            level, key = None, group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):  # Check if all elements are column names
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

            if all(k in obj.columns for k in keys):  # Check if all columns exist in DataFrame
                group_axis = Index(keys, name=group_axis.name)
                obj = obj[keys]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, when `key` is provided as a list, it checks if all elements are strings (column names) and if those columns exist in the DataFrame. If the conditions are met, it updates the `group_axis` and `obj` to include only the specified columns for grouping.

This fix addresses the issue where the function was not correctly handling the case of grouping by column names when the input is `axis=1`, and it ensures that the grouping is applied correctly.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when the input is `axis=1`, and the provided test cases should pass without raising a `KeyError`.
