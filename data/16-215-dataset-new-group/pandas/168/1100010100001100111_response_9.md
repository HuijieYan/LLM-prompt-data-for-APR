The bug in the _get_grouper function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the 'key' parameter when it is a string or a list of strings representing column names for grouping the DataFrame along the columns. The function incorrectly processes the 'key' when it should represent a column name as a string or a list of strings. This issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the 'key' parameter when it represents a column name or a list of column names for grouping along the columns (axis=1). The _get_grouper function does not properly check for and process the 'key' when it is a string or list of strings.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the 'key' parameter when it represents a column name as a string or a list of strings.

Here is a corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
        # axis of the object
        # ... (the rest of the original code remains the same)

    # the rest of the function remains the same

```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case when axis=1 and key is a single string by converting it to a list of strings. This ensures that the function correctly processes the key as column names for grouping along the columns.

By making this modification, the function will now correctly handle the 'key' parameter when it represents a column name as a string or a list of strings, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

This change will allow the function to properly group the DataFrame along the columns when using the 'key' parameter to specify column names.
