# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py

# Assuming that the rest of the function has no issues, the part that needs correction is the derivation of the `key` variable from the input `group_name`.
# Assuming that `group_name` is a representation of the grouping level(s) - a string or list.

# The buggy part of the function seems to be where 'key' is being processed, particularly when it is provided as a list of elements.

By checking if the provided 'key' is a tuple and meets defined criteria for unhashability and existence in 'obj', a proper list is constructed, ensuring an input the function can accept correctly. After this fix, the `key` variable will consistently and accurately serve as the final object's column name for group-wise computations.
