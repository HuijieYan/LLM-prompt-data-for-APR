The buggy function has several issues. First, it seems that the variable `level` is being manipulated inconsistently. Then, there are conditionals that are based on type checks that could be more precise. The validation and matching of the keys with the axis are also fraught with complexity and could be greatly simplified.

The cause of the bugs appears to be inconsistencies in level manipulations, incorrect type checks, and unnecessarily complex validation processes.

To fix the bug, it's suggested that the function be refactored to simplify the conditionals and level manipulations. The type checks should be more precise and the validation processes should be streamlined.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    else:
        # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
        # (e.g., level=[0])
        # GH 13901
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        if level != level:
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    else:
        if is_tuple:
            if (
                all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
            ) or not all_hashable:
                keys = list(key)
            else:
                keys = [key]

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and len(keys) == len(group_axis) and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

   # ... continue function ...

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
