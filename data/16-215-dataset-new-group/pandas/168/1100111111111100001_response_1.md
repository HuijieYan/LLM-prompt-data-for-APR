The root cause of the bug is that the function `_get_grouper` does not handle tuples correctly. As observed from the failing tests and the buggy function inputs, we can identify that the `key` parameter was a tuple. The function failed to handle tuples as a single key.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code logic to handle tuples correctly and ensure it interprets the tuple 'by' as a list of keys when a tuple will not be accepted as a single key. We can do this by adding an `if-else` condition to check if the `key` is a tuple and then process it accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the identified bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function logic)

    # check if the key is a tuple
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        # process tuple 'by' as a list of keys
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)
    
    # remaining logic of the function...
```

By incorporating this modification, the function will now handle tuples correctly and is expected to pass the failing tests.
