The bug in the `_get_grouper` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the "key" input parameter when it is a list. This causes the function to not properly group by the specified columns when the "key" is a list of column names.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the code to handle the case when the "key" parameter is a list of column names, and ensure that the grouping operation is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Group by multiple columns (keys)
        keys = key
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for col in keys:
            gpr = obj[col]
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=col,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(col)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    else:
        # Handle the case when key is not a list (i.e., a single column name)
        # ... (existing code for handling single key) ...
```

With this correction, the function can correctly handle the case when the "key" parameter is a list of column names, allowing the grouping operation based on multiple columns. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also align with the expected input/output values.
