Based on the failing test case and the GitHub issue, it appears that the buggy function `_get_grouper` is not properly handling the grouping by columns names when `axis=1`. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the keys and groupings for axis 1. The issue might be in the section where it checks for keys, processes multiple levels, and determines whether the gpr is in the axis or object.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`. This involves properly identifying the keys, handling different levels, and determining if the gpr is in the axis or object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if axis == 1:
        group_axis = obj.T._get_axis(0)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version specifically handles the case when `axis=1` by transposing the DataFrame and then getting the axis. This should resolve the issue and allow the grouping by columns names to work correctly.
