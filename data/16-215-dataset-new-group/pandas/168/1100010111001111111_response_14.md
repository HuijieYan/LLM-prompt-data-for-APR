The issue can be caused by the buggy function `_get_grouper`, as it is responsible for creating a BaseGrouper, which is used for grouping operations. The function is likely encountering issues in handling MultiIndex instances and not properly creating the groupings based on the specified key and axis.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to ensure that it handles MultiIndex instances correctly when creating the groupings. Additionally, we need to address the key selection and validation to ensure that it properly handles the grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

    if key is None or isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_categorical(obj[key])

    # Create the Grouping
    ping = Grouping(
        group_axis,
        key,
        obj=obj,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=sort,
        observed=observed,
        in_axis=False
    )

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [ping], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version should address the issues with handling MultiIndex instances and should properly handle the grouping by columns, resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases to ensure that it now produces the expected results and resolves the issues reported in the GitHub issue.
