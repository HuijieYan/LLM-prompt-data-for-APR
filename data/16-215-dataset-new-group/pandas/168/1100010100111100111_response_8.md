The issue with the function `_get_grouper` is that it fails to correctly handle the case when the key parameter is a single string or a list of strings representing the column name(s) for grouping when using `groupby`. This leads to a KeyError when attempting to group along the columns.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the input for grouping along the columns, leading to a KeyError when the input is a string or a list of strings representing column names.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when the key parameter represents the column name(s) for grouping when using `groupby` with axis=1.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]
    ...
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

This change ensures that if the `axis` is 1 and the `key` is a single string, it is converted into a list containing that string. This modification addresses the issue with grouping along the columns and should resolve the KeyError.

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case when the key parameter represents the column name(s) for grouping when using `groupby` with axis=1, and the failing test should pass.
