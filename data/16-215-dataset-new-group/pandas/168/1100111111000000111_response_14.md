Based on the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to how the function handles grouping along the columns using the `groupby` method. The function `_get_grouper` seems to have issues when dealing with grouping along the columns, especially when the column names are passed as the grouping key.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the provided column name as a valid key for grouping along the columns. This results in a KeyError when attempting to group along the columns, even though the provided key should be a valid column name.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be modified to correctly handle grouping along the columns, especially when using column names as the grouping key. It should also handle the case where the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    # mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.

    # ... (previous function body)

    if isinstance(key, str):  # check if the key is a string (column name)
        if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:  # if grouping along columns and key is in columns
            key = obj[key]  # use the column as the key

    # validate and other processing
    ...

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function will check if the key is a string (column name) and if the `axis` parameter is set to 1. If both conditions are met, it will use the column as the key for grouping along the columns.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and make the `_get_grouper` function correctly handle grouping along the columns.
