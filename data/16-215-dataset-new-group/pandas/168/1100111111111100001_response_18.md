### Bug Explanation
The `_get_grouper` function fails to properly handle column names passed as a list of keys in the `key` parameter. This is indicated by the stack trace pointing to the `_is_label_like` function, which checks if `key` is a label-like value in `obj`. Since `key` is in the format of a list of keys, it cannot be directly used to look up the columns of `obj` using `obj._data.items.get_loc(key)`. This results in a `KeyError` being raised when `key` is passed as a list, causing the test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle a list of keys in the `key` parameter, and ensure that the lookup of column names in `obj` is done for each element of the list separately.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    ...
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if key in group_axis:
            name = key
            gpr = obj[key]
            in_axis = True
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

        # create the Grouping
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
In this corrected version, we handle the case when `key` is a list, and for each element in the list, we perform a lookup for the key in the `Grouping` as well as create a Grouping instance. If a match is found, we proceed with the normal process of creating the BaseGrouper. Otherwise, we raise a `KeyError` with the offending key.
