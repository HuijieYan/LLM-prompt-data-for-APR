### Bug in the code
The bug in the code is related to the condition that checks if the key input is not in the index. If the key is not found, the function raises a `KeyError` due to the unhashable elements of the key that implies they wanted a list of keys, and the subsequent use of the `id()` function. This happens when the actual grouper should be obj[key] or if the grouper is obj[name]. However, since this is not the expected behavior, the function should evaluate this condition differently.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can improve the conditions checking if the grouper has a compatible index, add checks to ensure that a list of keys is created and cast to the appropriate variable type, remove unnecessary type checking for groupers, and refactor the function to simplify the flow of operations.

### The corrected function code
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
        else:
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if is_tuple := isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all_hashable := is_hashable(key):
            if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
                msg = (
                    "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                    "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                    "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
                )
                warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
                key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            if not all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys):
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            if not all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys):
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if is_in_obj(gpr, obj):
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)
        elif is_in_axis(gpr, obj):
            if mode := obj[gpr]:
                if validate:
                    obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
                in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, mode
                exclusions.append(name)
            elif obj._is_level_reference(gpr):
                in_axis, name, level, gpr = False, None, gpr, None
            else:
                raise KeyError(gpr)

        # ...remaining code for the _get_grouper function...

def is_in_axis(key, obj):
    if not _is_label_like(key):
        try:
            obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
        except Exception:
            return False
    return True

def is_in_obj(gpr, obj):
    try:
        return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
    except Exception:
        return False
```
After fixing the identified bug in the `_get_grouper` function, it is important to rerun all the failing tests, including those that were not used to diagnose the bug, to ensure that the corrected function works as expected.
