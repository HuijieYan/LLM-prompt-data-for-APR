## The bug
The bug is causing a KeyError to be raised when trying to group by column name(s) using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. This occurs even when the column name is a valid label within the DataFrame.

## Bug location
The issue seems to be arising within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the sections where it handles column names and keys for grouping by columns.

## Bug explanation
The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the case of grouping by column name(s) when using `axis=1`. The `Raise KeyError(gpr)` statement is triggered even when the key is a valid column name.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by column name(s) when using `axis=1`. This likely involves updating the logic within the `_get_grouper` function related to checking and handling column names and grouping by columns.

## The corrected version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        key = [key]

    # ... existing code ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, the code checks if the `key` is a string and the `axis` is set to 1. If so, it converts the string key to a list containing that key. This modification allows for correct handling of column names when grouping by columns.

After making this change, the function should handle the grouping by column name(s) correctly when using `axis=1` in the `groupby` function.
