The function `_get_grouper` has several issues.

1. There are multiple conditional blocks, which make it complicated to understand and maintain.
2. The code for identifying whether a certain value is in the axis or not is overly complicated and prone to errors.
3. There are various nested conditional statements which make the function less readable and increase its cognitive complexity.

To fix these bugs, it is important to simplify the conditional checks and reduce its cognitive complexity.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # some code removed for brevity
    
    # Simplify the key checking
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # return key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False) directly
        return key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
    
    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Simplify tuple key interpretation
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)

        if len(key) == 1 and key[0] in obj:
            key = key[0]

    # Flatten the conditional blocks for clarity
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    
    # rest of the code remains mostly unchanged
```

This corrected version attempts to simplify the `if-else` blocks, making the function easier to understand and maintain. It reduces the nested conditional statements and simplifies the `tuple` key interpretation.
