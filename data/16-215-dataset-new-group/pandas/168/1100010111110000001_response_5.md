The `group_name` parameter should always be coerced to a list in order to ensure consistent input type.

The cause of the bug is that the `group_name` parameter is being directly passed into the `_get_grouper` function without being coerced to a list, and this results in a `KeyError` because it doesn't match the expected input types. The `_get_grouper` function expects a list, but when `group_name` is a string in the failing test, it causes the error.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that `group_name` is always a list before being passed into the `_get_grouper` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
        
    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        ...
        # (remaining code unchanged)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The above fix ensures that the `group_name` parameter is always coerced into a list before being used in the `_get_grouper` function, which resolves the `KeyError` issue which was occurring due to an unexpected input type.
