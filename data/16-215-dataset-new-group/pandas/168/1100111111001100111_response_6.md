## Correction

The reported issue relates to the `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` line, which raises a KeyError even though "x" is a valid column name. Looking at the provided information, it seems that the `_get_grouper` function has multiple conditional checks that might be incorrectly handling the grouping by the column name. To fix this bug, we need to check the logic related to grouping by the column name in the `_get_grouper` function.

Upon reviewing the cases and considering the GitHub issue, it seems that the incorrect handling of grouping by the column name within the `_get_grouper` function is causing the bug. To resolve this issue, we need to update the logic that identifies the column name for grouping.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling grouping by the column name
    if key is not None and is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    if key in obj.columns:
        name = key
        gpr = obj[key]
        
        # Create the Grouping for grouping by the column name
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        # Return the resulting grouper
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [ping], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [name], obj
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)
```

In this correction, we explicitly handle the case of grouping by the column name and create the necessary Grouping object for the grouper. This should resolve the KeyError issue when attempting to group along the columns.

Please test this corrected version to ensure it resolves the reported bug and passes the failing test case.
