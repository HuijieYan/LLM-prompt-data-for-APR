The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when the `key` parameter is a list. This results in the KeyError. The conditional statement checking for `is_tuple` should also account for the case when key is a list, not a single tuple key.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made in the function:
1. Modify the conditional statement `if is_tuple:` to `if is_tuple or isinstance(key, list):` to handle the case when key is a list.
2. Inside this conditional statement, when `is_tuple` is True, convert `key` to a list using `key = list(key)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous function code)
    
    if is_tuple or isinstance(key, list):
        if (
            all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            # column names ('a', 'b') -> ['a', 'b']
            # arrays like (a, b) -> [a, b]
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
    # ...
```

This fix ensures that the function handles both single keys and a list of keys correctly. After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
