The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. In the given GitHub issue, there is a complaint about not being able to group by columns using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`, which resulted in a KeyError.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for multiple cases, it appears that the function is not properly handling the case where `key` is a list of column names. This is evident from the values of `keys`, `match_axis_length`, and the groupings not being created.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case when `key` is a list of column names and properly create the groupings for each column. Additionally, the function should be modified to account for grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    ...
    """

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        group_axis = obj.columns
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]

        for k in key:
            if k in obj.columns:
                gpr = obj[k]
                ping = Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(k)

        if len(groupings) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    else:
        # The original logic for index-based grouping
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        if level is not None:
            # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the case when `axis` is 1 and `key` is a list of column names. It creates groupings for each specified column and returns the BaseGrouper accordingly.

By addressing this issue, the function should resolve the problem outlined in the GitHub issue.
