## Bug cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the key parameter and its relationship with the axis parameter. The function is not correctly identifying the group_axis when grouping along columns.

## Bug fix strategy:
1. Modify the logic related to identifying the group_axis when grouping along columns to ensure the correct identification.
2. Make sure that the key parameter is appropriately handled when grouping along columns.

## The corrected function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...
    if axis == 0:  # Grouping along rows
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    else:  # Grouping along columns
        group_axis = obj.columns

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # TODO: These if-block and else-block...

    # ... (rest of the code without changes)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function, the logic to identify the group_axis has been modified to correctly handle the grouping along columns. This should resolve the issue of incorrect grouping when using the groupby() function along columns.
