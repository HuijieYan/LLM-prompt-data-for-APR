Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to a bug in the `_get_grouper` function, where it fails to properly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`. The function is not correctly forming the groupings based on the input key and axis, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the section where it tries to determine the grouping based on the input key, axis, and level. Specifically, the conditional checks and assignments related to handling the `axis=1` case might be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug appears to be a misinterpretation of the input parameters `key`, `axis`, and the handling of groupings based on columns. The function does not properly handle the case where the grouping is intended to be performed along the columns (`axis=1`) when specifying the key as the column name.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and updating the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`. This could involve revisiting the conditional checks, assignments, and handling of the input key, axis, and level to ensure that the function forms the correct groupings based on the specified parameters.

With this understanding, here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    if axis == 1:
        if key in obj:
            # Handle grouping by columns when key is present in the columns
            gpr = key
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, key, obj[key]
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)
    
    # ... (rest of the function implementation remains unchanged)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
In the corrected version, we added a specific condition to handle the case when `axis=1`. If the key is present in the columns, it forms the groupings based on the column name as intended.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the case of grouping by columns when `axis=1`, resolving the issue of unexpected errors and improper grouping behavior.
