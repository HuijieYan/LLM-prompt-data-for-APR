The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of grouping by columns using the `groupby` method. The bug may be causing the `groupby` method to raise a KeyError when using `axis=1` to group by columns.

The potential error locations within the buggy function can be identified by analyzing the if-else conditions that handle the key and level parameters. These conditions determine how the key and level are processed and used to create the groupings. Any discrepancies or incorrect processing in these conditions could lead to the KeyError being raised during the grouping process.

The cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the processing of the `key` and `level` parameters within the `_get_grouper` function. The function may not be handling the grouping by columns (`axis=1`) properly, leading to a KeyError being raised.

The strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the conditionals that handle the `key` and `level` parameters need to be carefully reviewed and modified if necessary to ensure that grouping by columns is properly supported. Additionally, the handling of the `axis` parameter and the creation of groupings based on columns needs to be verified to address the KeyError issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validating and processing the level and key parameters
    if level is not None:
        # ... (handling of level and key based on axis type)

    # handling grouping by columns
    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        key = list(key)
        columns = obj.columns
        if all(k in columns for k in key):
            group_axis = columns[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError("Columns specified in key do not exist")

    # creating the groupings
    groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, gpr, obj=obj, name=name, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)
                 for gpr, name in zip(keys, levels)]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function to handle the grouping by columns properly based on the `axis` parameter and the provided `key`, the bug causing the KeyError should be addressed.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `groupby` method works as expected when grouping data along columns.
