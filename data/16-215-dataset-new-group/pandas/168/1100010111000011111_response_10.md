The bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be related to the handling of group keys and axis when using `groupby` along the columns. Specifically, the issue seems to stem from the conditional checks for the type of `group_axis` (whether it's a `MultiIndex` or not) and subsequent processing based on that type.

The cause of the bug is related to the conditionals and handling of `level` and `key` within the function. The conditionals for `group_axis` being a `MultiIndex` seem to be causing issues, especially in cases where `level` is not a single level or where `key` is supposed to be an actual key but is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, it is important to review the conditional statements related to `group_axis` and `level`, and ensure that the processing for both single level and multi-level indices is handled correctly. Additionally, the processing of `key` and its conversion to a list when necessary should be reviewed to ensure the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python

    level=None,

    validate=True,

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):

                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )

```

The corrected version aims to address the conditional processing related to `group_axis`, `level`, and `key`, ensuring that all cases are handled correctly based on the expected behavior. This should address the issues related to grouping along the columns and ensure correct behavior as per the GitHub issue.
