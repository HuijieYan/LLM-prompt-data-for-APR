## Fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of grouping by columns in the `_get_grouper` function, as reported in the GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

To fix this bug, we need to review the logic related to grouping by columns and ensure that it works as expected. Specifically, we need to verify the handling of column names and the axis when grouping.

The main issue seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is handled to allow grouping by columns. We should ensure that the function correctly identifies the intention to group by columns and handles it appropriately.

Additionally, we need to address the KeyError being raised when attempting to group by columns, ensuring that the `is_in_axis` function correctly identifies the specified column as a valid grouping key.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers.

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers.

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):  # Check if grouping by columns
        group_axis = obj.columns
        key = list(key)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a condition to check if the `axis` parameter is 1 and if `key` is a list. If both conditions are met, it indicates the intention to group by columns. In that case, we assign the `group_axis` to `obj.columns` and convert `key` to a list.

By making this change, the function should correctly identify and handle the case where grouping by columns is intended, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
