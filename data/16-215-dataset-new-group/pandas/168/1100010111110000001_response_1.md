The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when passing `group_name` as `x` and `['x']` in the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter, which is trying to infer the actual keys based on the input value. 

The error message indicates that the KeyError is raised when trying to handle the `group_name` parameter. The issue seems to be with the conditional statements and the processing of the `key` and `level` parameters.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic for handling the `key` and `level` parameters. Additionally, evaluate the conditional statements and the processing of different input types for `key`.

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code as is...

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Updated logic for handling level and key
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Existing code...

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This updated version aims to provide a cleaner handling of the `level` and `key` parameters, essentially removing redundant conditional blocks and ensuring clarity in the processing of these parameters.
