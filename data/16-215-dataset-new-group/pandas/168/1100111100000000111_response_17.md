Based on the given issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `groupby` method not properly handling the grouping along columns when `axis=1`. The result is a KeyError even when the column name is provided.

The cause of the bug in the `_get_grouper` function is related to the handling of grouping by columns. It seems that the condition for checking if the key is present in the object is flawed, leading to the KeyError when grouping by column names.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for checking if the key is present in the object when grouping by columns. This could involve ensuring that the key is properly identified as a column name and not causing a KeyError when attempting to create the grouper.

Given the bug and the suggested strategy for fixing it, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Logic for handling grouping along columns
    if axis == 1:
        # Check if the key is a valid column name
        if key is not None:
            if is_list_like(key):
                keys = key
            else:
                keys = [key]

            valid_columns = [col for col in obj.columns if col in keys]
            if len(valid_columns) != len(keys):
                raise KeyError("One or more keys are not valid column names")

            # Create the Grouping for columns
            groupings = [
                Grouping(
                    obj.columns,
                    key,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                for key in valid_columns
            ]

            # Create the BaseGrouper for columns
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

            return grouper, [], obj

    # Original logic for handling grouping along index (unchanged)
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly checks if the key is a valid column name when grouping along columns, and creates the necessary Grouping and BaseGrouper objects to handle the grouping by columns. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
