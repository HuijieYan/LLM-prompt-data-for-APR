## Bug Fix:

    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

```
In this fix, we added an additional check in the `_get_grouper` function to handle the groupby operation on columns using column names. If the axis is 1 and the key is a scalar or a list-like object and exists in the DataFrame's columns, then it is converted to a list for further processing. This modification allows the function to handle groupby operations on columns using column names as intended.

We have also tested the corrected function with the failing test and verified that it now produces the expected output. This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
