The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, which leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns. Based on the GitHub issue, the expected behavior is to be able to group by columns using the `axis=1` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to correctly handle the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. Specifically, the function should recognize column names and properly handle them when creating the groupings.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        # If key is None, use the default behavior
        if axis == 0:
            key = obj.index
        else:
            key = obj.columns
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        # If key is a string, ensure it's a valid column name
        if axis == 1 and key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(f"Column name '{key}' is not in the columns of the DataFrame")
        key = [key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the `key` parameter when grouping by columns, ensuring that it recognizes column names and behaves as expected.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
