There are multiple issues with the `_get_grouper` function in the file `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`. The function does not handle the grouping by column names correctly, as highlighted in the GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The function incorrectly handles the case for grouping by column names and raises a KeyError instead of grouping the columns correctly. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1`. The issue in the function is related to the handling of column names and multi-index columns, leading to an incorrect grouping result.

To fix this, we can modify the function to correctly handle the grouping by column names and multi-index columns. We can start by checking if the `key` represents column names and then perform the grouping accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles multi-index columns when performing grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing implementation

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
            keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
            groupings = []
            for k in keys:
                if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                    if k not in obj.columns:
                        raise KeyError(f"Column '{k}' not found in DataFrame")
                if k not in obj:
                    raise KeyError(f"Column '{k}' not found in DataFrame")
                grouper = BaseGrouper(obj[k], sort=sort, in_axis=True)
                groupings.append(grouper)
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj[obj.columns], groupings=groupings, sort=sort, in_axis=True)
            return grouper, [], obj

    # Continue with the remaining implementation for other cases
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the `axis` is 1 and `key` represents column names. If so, we create a `BaseGrouper` object for each column and then combine them into a single `BaseGrouper` for grouping along the columns.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles the grouping by column names. It should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` pass.
