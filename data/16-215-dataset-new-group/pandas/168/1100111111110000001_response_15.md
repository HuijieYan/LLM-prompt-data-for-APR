The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of a list of keys in the `group_name` parameter. The function is expecting a single key, but it receives a list of keys. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access and use the list of keys as a single key, which results in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle both cases: when a single key is passed and when a list of keys is passed.

Here's a correction to the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]  # Convert single key to list
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # ... (remaining code is unchanged)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `key` parameter is checked to see if it's a list. If it's not a list, it's converted to a list for consistency. The rest of the function is left unchanged.

This correction should resolve the issue with the `_get_grouper` function and make it capable of handling both single keys and lists of keys, allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
