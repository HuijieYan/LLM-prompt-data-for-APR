It seems that the issue is related to the `groupby` function not properly handling the grouping by column names when `axis=1`. 

Based on the provided information from the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug may be occurring due to how the function is handling the grouping by column names. The key error in the failing test cases is a `KeyError` when trying to group by a single specified column name.

To fix the bug, the `groupby` function needs to correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    if isinstance(key, str):  # Check if key is a single column name
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if key is not found in columns
        key = [key]  # Convert the key to a list for consistency

    # ... (existing function code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By including this check and conversion of the key to a list when it's a single column name, we ensure that the function can correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
