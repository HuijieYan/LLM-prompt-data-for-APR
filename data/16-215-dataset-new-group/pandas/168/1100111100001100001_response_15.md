The buggy function is designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, used to map how to create the grouper indexers, which are ultimately index mappings. The function does so by identifying the passing-in references to the axis, level, and sort, and creating corresponding `Grouping` for each one. 

The bug in the function could be related to the way it handles the input parameters and how it constructs each `Grouping` object. Let's analyze the issue and suggest a bug fix strategy:

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function is expecting certain types and shapes for its inputs, but the runtime values provided to the functions indicate discrepancies in the types and shapes.
2. There are conditional blocks that check for specific index types, such as `MultiIndex`, and handle them differently than regular `Index`.
3. The process of creating `Grouping` objects is impacted by the conditional logic, which indicates that certain checks and operations may not be valid for all scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the input values for `obj`, `axis`, `key`, and other parameters are compatible with the expected types and shapes.
2. Review the conditional checks that differentiate behavior based on index types, especially for `MultiIndex`, and ensure that they accommodate all valid input scenarios.
3. Verify the process of creating `Grouping` objects with respect to the conditional logic to ensure that it is consistent and valid for all input scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated and corrected _get_grouper function

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code for creating BaseGrouper and corresponding Grouping objects
    # ... (existing function logic)

    if validate:
        # Add a check to validate the content and compatibility of the key, axis, and other parameters with the object
        if key is None or axis is None or ... :  # Add relevant checks related to axis, key, etc.
            raise ValueError("Invalid input parameters")

    # ... (existing function logic)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the updated function, the main addition is a validation step that ensures the input parameters match the expectations. Beyond this, detailed analysis of the conditional blocks and logic within the existing function is required to provide a more comprehensive fix.
