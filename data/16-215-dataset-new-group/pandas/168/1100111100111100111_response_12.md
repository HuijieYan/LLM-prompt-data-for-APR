Based on the provided information, it looks like the issue is related to the `groupby` function not properly handling the grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The function `_get_grouper` is involved in the error, specifically in handling the keys for grouping.

The bug seems to be related to the condition for processing the keys passed to the function. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the case when a single key is passed as a list. 

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the keys and handling them as lists should be adjusted to properly handle the case when a single key is passed as a list.

After making adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function can be as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # remove the existing code block and replace it with the following condition
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

This adjustment ensures that when a single key is passed as a list, the function correctly extracts the key from the list to handle the grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

After making this change, the function should be able to correctly handle the grouping by column names, resolving the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
