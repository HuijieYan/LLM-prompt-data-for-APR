After analyzing the test cases and the buggy function, you can see that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `key` input parameter when it is a list. At the point where the function checks the type of `key`, it only supports a single key or a tuple of keys, but it does not consider a list of keys. 

To fix this bug, you need to handle lists of keys the same way as tuples of keys.

Below is the corrected version of the function based on the identified bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    
    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers
    
    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.
    
    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.
    
    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values
    
    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        key = list(key) if isinstance(key, tuple) else key
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # rest of the function remains unchanged

        if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
            if key is None:
                keys = [None] * len(level)
            levels = level
        else:
            levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version should now handle a list of keys the same way as it handles a tuple of keys, hence fixing the identified bug.
