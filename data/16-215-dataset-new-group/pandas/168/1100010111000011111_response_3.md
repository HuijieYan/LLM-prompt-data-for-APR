The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the function handles grouping by column names when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`.

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function include:
1. Handling of the `level` parameter.
2. Logic around checking if the groupers are in the index or columns.
3. Handling of the `keys` and `levels` variables.
4. Creation of the `groupings` and `exclusions` lists.

The bug causes the `groupby` method to fail when attempting to group by column names using `axis=1`. The function does not correctly handle the grouping by column names, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to properly handle grouping by column names when using `axis=1` in the `groupby` method.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug and should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    if axis == 1 and level is None:
        if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
            key = key
        elif isinstance(key, list) and all(k in obj.columns for k in key):
            key = key
        else:
            raise KeyError("key must be a column name or a list of column names")

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
In this corrected version, the handling of the `key` parameter for `axis=1` is modified to correctly identify and validate column names when grouping by columns. This modification should address the bug and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
