The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is related to how the function is handling the `key` parameter when grouping along the columns. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a KeyError when trying to group by columns, even though the intention is to group by the "x" column label.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `key` parameter for grouping along the columns. The function is not appropriately identifying the key as a column label and is instead treating it as a different type of input, leading to the KeyError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the `key` parameter for grouping along the columns and ensure that it correctly identifies the key as a column label.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Fix for grouping along the columns
    elif is_list_like(key) and axis == 1:
        key = list(key)  # Ensure that the key is treated as a list of column labels
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(obj.columns)

        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns for g in keys
                )
                if all_in_columns_index:
                    # If all the keys are in the columns, adjust the key to be a single column label
                    key = keys[0]
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                # Handle the case for grouping along the columns for a Series
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index for g in keys)
                if all_in_columns_index:
                    key = keys[0]

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making the above modifications to handle the `key` parameter for grouping along the columns, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue and group along the columns as expected.
