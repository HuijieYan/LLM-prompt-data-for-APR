The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to group correctly when using the `groupby` method with the axis parameter set to 1 on column names. This issue is evident in failing test cases, and the corresponding error message displays a KeyError when attempting to group by columns. The runtime input/output variable values show that there is an issue with the way the keys are being handled within the function, leading to incorrect grouping.

The cause of the bug lies in the mishandling of the keys when a list of strings is passed as the key parameter. The function does not correctly process a list of strings for grouping by columns, leading to the KeyError. The function fails to recognize multiple keys when provided as a list, causing the error.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be modified to handle the case where a list of strings is passed as the key parameter. This modification should ensure that the function correctly processes multiple column names and performs the grouping as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # determine if key is a list of column names
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # create Grouping for each column name in the list
        for col in keys:
            gpr = col
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

    # ... (existing code)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle a list of column names provided as the key parameter for grouping, allowing the function to group by columns as expected.

This updated version of the `_get_grouper` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases. It ensures that when a list of column names is provided, each column is properly processed for grouping.
