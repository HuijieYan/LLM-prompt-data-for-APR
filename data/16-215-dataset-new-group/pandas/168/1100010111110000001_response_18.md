## Analysis
The `_get_grouper` function is part of the Pandas library, specifically the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The function is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The bug appears to be related to passing a group name or list of group names as a parameter when calling the `groupby` function on a DataFrame. The failing test checks whether the function fails when the `group_name` parameter is provided as either a single group name or a list of group names.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
- The error seems to be related to the handling of `group_name` as a list of group names.
- The use of `group_name` and how it's passed to the `groupby` function seems to be a potential source of the error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `group_name` when it is provided as a list of group names. The current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function doesn't handle the case where `group_name` is a list, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the elements in the list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the case where `group_name` is provided as a list. Additionally, we need to ensure that the code can handle both single group names and lists of group names when calling the `groupby` function.

## Code Fix
Based on the analysis, the following corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function will handle both single group names and lists of group names when calling the `groupby` function.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...
    
    # validation and other checks

    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
        # convert the list of group names to their corresponding columns
        keys = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) if k in obj.columns else k for k in keys]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid group name")

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # Create the Grouping based on the group names or columns
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=(gpr in obj.columns)
        )
        # Add the Grouping to the list of groupings
        groupings.append(ping)

    # ...

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function checks whether the `key` parameter is a single group name or a list of group names. If it's a list, it converts the group names to their corresponding columns and creates the Groupings based on the column indices when calling the `groupby` function.

This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle both single group names and lists of group names correctly.
