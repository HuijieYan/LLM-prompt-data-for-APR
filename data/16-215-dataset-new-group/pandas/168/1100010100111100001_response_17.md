The buggy function `_get_grouper` is part of the Pandas library and is used for creating an internal index mapping of how to create the grouper indexers for groupby operations. It contains a substantial amount of code dealing with different types of input parameters and generating the appropriate groupings.

The error messages in all failing test cases indicate a `KeyError: 'x'` at line 615 of the `_get_grouper` function, which suggests that the provided key is not found in the object when the grouping is being performed. The input parameters include the object, axis, key, and other optional parameters that define the grouping operation.

On examining the output of the variables right before the return of the function, the following observations can be made:
- The `key` that is being passed to `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` for validation is not being processed correctly.
- The `keys` is inferred from the `key` and the `group_axis`, but `match_axis_length` is incorrectly set to False.
- The final grouping consists of `groupings` and `exclusions`, both of which remain empty.
- The specific value causing the KeyError does not appear to be correctly processed or validated.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. When processing the `key`, ensure that it is split into multiple keys if it's a list or tuple.
2. During the validation of the keys, match the axis length to the length of the group_axis for appropriate processing.
3. Validate the exclusion of specific values from the groupings.
4. Address the issue causing the KeyError to resolve the grouping error.

An updated version of the `_get_grouper` function that should address the issues resulting in the KeyError is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Code for processing 'level' not shown here

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):  # Processing list or tuple keys
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    else:  # Processing single key
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Code for processing any_callable, any_arraylike, any_groupers not shown here

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # Code for processing in_obj not shown here
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)

        # Code for processing `is_in_axis` not shown here

        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                (
                    "Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis})"
                    " must be same length".format(
                        len_gpr=len(gpr), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                    )
                )
            )

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
            if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping)
            else gpr
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
This is a simplified and corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function, which should resolve the issues leading to the KeyError during groupby operations.

Please note that this code is part of a larger codebase and has not been tested in isolation. Always test thoroughly when introducing changes.
