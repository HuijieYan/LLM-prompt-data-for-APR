The buggy function `_get_grouper` has an error in the logic used to determine the groupings. Specifically, there is a problem with handling keys and levels for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, as well as issues with the `keys` input parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function applies logic to handle keys and levels for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, but the handling of these cases can be simplified. There is also an issue with the `keys` variable not being assigned correctly, and this can affect subsequent logic and cause errors in handling groups.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for handling keys and levels, and to ensure that the `keys` variable is assigned properly to ensure that the correct groups are created.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code removed for brevity

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Simplified logic for handling keys and levels
    if level is not None and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if not is_list_like(level):
            level = [level]
        if len(level) != 1:
            raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Simplified handling of keys variable
    if key is None:
        keys = group_axis
    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Existing code removed for brevity

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By simplifying the logic for handling keys and levels and ensuring that the `keys` variable is assigned correctly, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function should be fixed. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
