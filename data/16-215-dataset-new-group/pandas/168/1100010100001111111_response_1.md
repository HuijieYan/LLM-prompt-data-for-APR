Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_get_grouper` function is related to the processing of the `key` parameter when `axis` is set to 1 (indicating grouping by columns). The function fails to properly handle the column name when grouping along columns. This issue has been reported on GitHub, where the expectation is to group by columns using the `groupby` method, but there is an unexpected KeyError when attempting to do so.

The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a scenario where it does not correctly handle the grouping by columns. The issue may be related to the way the key parameter is processed within the function, leading to the unexpected KeyErrors reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the grouping by columns. It should properly process the key parameter when grouping by columns and ensure that it correctly identifies the columns to be grouped. Additionally, any conditions or checks related to the handling of the key and column groups should be reviewed and updated to ensure that the function works as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Code for handling grouping along index
    if axis == 0:
        # Your existing code for grouping along index

    # Code for handling grouping along columns
    elif axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for col in key:
            if col in obj.columns:
                gpr = obj[col]
                ping = Grouping(
                    obj.columns,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=col,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
            else:
                raise KeyError(col)

        # Create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for axis")

```

In this corrected version, the function includes specific handling for grouping along columns when the `axis` is set to 1. It checks if the provided key is a valid column name and then creates the necessary groupings for columns based on the key.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should correctly handle the grouping by columns, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Please note that the actual fix might require a more detailed understanding of the entire codebase, and it's important to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure it works as intended.
