The potential cause of the bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be the conditional logic used to handle the `level` parameter and its relationship with `group_axis` and `key`. This logic is complex and contains redundant checks, which may lead to incorrect processing of the `level` parameter for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, leading to unexpected behavior in the grouping.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to simplify the conditional checks related to `level`, `group_axis`, and `key`. This would involve revisiting the decision points and eliminating redundant checks that may not be necessary or appropriate. Additionally, it could be beneficial to refactor the logic in a way that clearly separates the handling of MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases for better clarity and maintainability.

Here's an updated, corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle non-MultiIndex case
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
                    
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
        else:
            # Handle MultiIndex case
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

    # Continue processing and return the grouper
    # ...
```
This updated function aims to streamline the handling of `level` for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases and remove redundant checks to improve clarity and correctness. After incorporating this corrected version of the function, you should test to ensure that the failing tests are resolved.
