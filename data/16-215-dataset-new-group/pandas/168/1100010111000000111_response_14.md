The buggy function `_get_grouper` has a few potential error locations, including:
1. The handling of level when it is not a MultiIndex - the function raises a ValueError if level is a string and obj.index.name is not equal to level, which might not be the intended behavior.
2. The handling of keys when it is not a list - the function tries to convert a single key to a list, which might not be necessary in all cases.
3. The logic for determining if a key is in the axis or obj might not cover all possible cases.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles grouping by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. This behavior is not consistent with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for handling level and keys and improve the logic for determining if a key is in the axis or obj.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling level
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

    # Handling keys
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Improved logic for determining if a key is in the axis or obj
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and pass the failing test.
