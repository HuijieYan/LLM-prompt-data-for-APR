The cause of the failing test for the `test_groupby_axis_1` function seems to be related to how the `key` variable is handled and the assertion is failing. The issue occurs when the groupby operation is performed on a MultiIndex column (`mi` in the test function) and the `sum` function is applied on it. The `key` extraction and handling needs to be more efficient and need to properly handle a MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `_get_grouper` function by refactoring and simplifying the section that handles the `key` and `level` for a MultiIndex. The bug is in the logic flow and variable handling for MultiIndex keys and levels that need to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not -1 <= level < group_axis.nlevels:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, the key and level handling for MultiIndex has been updated to ensure that the logic and variable handling align with the expected behavior.

After applying this correction, the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` should pass successfully.
