To fix the issue, we'll need to modify the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. Based on the provided information, the expected input values, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the grouping by columns not working as expected. The `groupby` function with `axis=1` fails to perform the grouping by column name(s).

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function are related to the handling of the keys when `axis=1` and the creation of the Grouping objects for each key.

The cause of the bug is in the `_get_grouper` function, where it does not handle the grouping by column name(s) correctly when `axis=1`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the keys and the creation of Grouping objects to properly account for column-wise grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]

            if is_scalar(key):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                group_axis = obj[key]

        else:
            if is_list_like(key):
                nkeys = len(key)
                if nkeys == 1:
                    key = key[0]
                elif nkeys == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple keys only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(key, str):
                if key not in obj.columns:
                    raise KeyError("key %s not found in columns" % key)
            else:
                if key > 0 or key < -1:
                    raise ValueError("key > 0 or key < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            key = obj[key]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `groupby` function works as expected when grouping along columns with `axis=1`.

By making the above changes, the function should now handle the grouping by column name(s) correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Please replace the existing `_get_grouper` function with the corrected version provided above in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file.
