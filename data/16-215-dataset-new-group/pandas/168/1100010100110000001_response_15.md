The error is caused by the function _get_grouper, where the KeyError is raised. This happens when the key 'x' is passed in the groupby call and the function is unable to locate the key within the DataFrame.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug can be to verify the key argument and ensure it's present in the object's data before proceeding with the groupby operation. Additionally, ensure that the key is not a hashable object to avoid incorrect interpretation of the input.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    # existing code...

    # check if the key is in the data columns or index names
    if key not in obj and key not in obj.index.names and key not in obj.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not found in data columns or index names")

    # prevent interpreting a tuple key incorrectly
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    # the rest of the logic...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version checks if the key is in the data columns or index names before proceeding and also handles the interpretation of a tuple key correctly.
