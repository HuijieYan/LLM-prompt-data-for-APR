The issue appears to be with the variable `key` being passed as a list rather than a single key when calling the `groupby` method. The function is not appropriately handling the list input. It also fails because the function that is being called to define the `grouper` is not handling the input key properly.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug includes checking whether the `key` is a list and defining a condition to handle a single key input differently from a list of keys. Additionally, the function being called to define the `grouper` should be updated to handle this condition correctly, especially in the sections where it checks whether the key is a Grouper or a BaseGrouper.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # ...(existing code)

    # If key is a single key or a Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, (str, Grouper)):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Process a list of keys
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            g = obj[k] if k in obj else Grouping(group_axis, k, obj=obj, in_axis=(k in obj))
            groupings.append(g)
            if k in obj:
                exclusions.append(k)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Handle other cases
    else:
        # Handle other cases or raise exception
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type provided.")
```

This corrected version checks the type of the `key` parameter and processes a list of keys if it is a list. It utilizes appropriate conditions to handle single keys, BaseGroupers, and other cases.
