Based on the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` argument. The issue is that when grouping by columns, the function raises a KeyError even though the intent is to group by the column label.

Looking at the `groupby` function provided, the bug seems to be related to the handling of grouping by column names. The key issue appears to be in the loop where it checks for the presence of the grouping variables and if they are in the axis or in the object. It also checks for any categorical dtype values and ensures their length is the same as the axis.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition and logic for handling the grouping variables when they are column names. We need to ensure that the column names are correctly recognized and grouped. Additionally, the error handling when grouping by column names should be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the `groupby` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing function implementation

    # change the conditional block for handling column names
    if isinstance(group_axis, DataFrame) and axis == 1:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if level is not None and level in group_axis.columns:
            key = group_axis[level]

    # ... rest of the existing function implementation
```

In the corrected version, we add a specific condition to handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`. We check if the `level` provided is a valid column name and then use it to create the key for grouping.

This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the `groupby` function to correctly handle grouping by columns.
