### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the `groupby` method not correctly handling grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating the grouping objects, and it seems that there are issues with recognizing and handling column names when grouping along the columns.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue could be related to the code that checks whether the passed `level` is compatible with the object's axis, as well as the code that handles the creation of the Grouping objects based on the keys passed for grouping.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug can be caused by the code in the function `_get_grouper` that handles the recognition and processing of grouping keys when grouping along columns. It may not correctly identify and handle the columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, which results in a KeyError.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to accurately identify and handle the column names when grouping on columns. This may involve revisiting the logic for processing the keys and creating the Grouping objects for columns.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if axis == 1 and not isinstance(key, (Grouper, list, tuple)):
        # If grouping by columns and the key is not a Grouper, list, or tuple
        # assume it is a column name and convert it to a list
        key = [key]

    # rest of the logic remains the same

    # Return the grouper, exclusions, and obj
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle the case when grouping along columns (axis=1) and the key is not a Grouper, list, or tuple. In this case, we assume it is a single column name and convert it to a list for consistency in processing. This change should ensure that column names are correctly handled when grouping along columns.
