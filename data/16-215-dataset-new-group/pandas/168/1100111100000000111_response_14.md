Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, the bug appears to be related to the handling of grouping by column names using the `groupby()` function with the `axis=1` parameter. The bug causes a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_grouper()` function where it fails to recognize the intention to group by column names when the `axis=1` parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper()` function needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1` is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]  # Handle single column name

    if key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]  # Convert column name to the actual column data

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, keys=[key], level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)

    return grouper, [], obj
```

This function modification checks if the `axis` is set to `1` and then ensures that the `key` (column name) is correctly handled as the actual column data. Additionally, it uses the `BaseGrouper` to create the appropriate grouping for the columns.

This should address the bug and allow grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter in the `groupby()` function.
