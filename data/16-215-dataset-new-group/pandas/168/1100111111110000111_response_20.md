```python

    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if is_categorical_dtype(obj[key]) and len(obj[key]) != len(obj):
            raise ValueError(f"Length of grouper ({len(obj[key])}) and axis ({len(obj)}) must be same length")

        key = obj[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        try:
            key = obj[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError(f"{key} is not a valid column name in the DataFrame")

    # the rest of the function continues as is
    # ...
```
The change in this corrected code is in the lines that handle the `key` parameter. We're checking if the `key` is a string, and if so, we're converting it to the actual column in the DataFrame. If the `key` is a list or tuple, we're attempting to get those columns from the DataFrame, and raising an error if any of the keys are not valid column names.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
