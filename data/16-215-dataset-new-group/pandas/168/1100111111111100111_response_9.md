Based on the provided information, it looks like the issue with the buggy function is related to the groupby operation not correctly handling the axis parameter for grouping by columns. This is causing a KeyError when trying to group by columns names. The bug seems to be with how the axis parameter is handled within the _get_grouper function.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the axis parameter is correctly handled to allow grouping by column names when axis=1. This will involve checking the axis parameter and adjusting the logic within the _get_grouper function accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_grouper function which should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing-in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """

    if axis == 0:
        # Grouping by row index
        group_axis = obj.index
    elif axis == 1:
        # Grouping by column names
        group_axis = obj.columns
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid axis value")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By adding the conditional handling of the axis parameter, the corrected function should now properly handle the groupby operation based on the specified axis, and avoid the KeyError issue when trying to group by column names.

After applying this fix, the provided failing tests should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
