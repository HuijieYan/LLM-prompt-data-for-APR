The bug in the given function is a logical error that exists in the `if` block where the function tries to validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object.

There are potential error locations in the level validation and groupings processing part of the function.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of the level values for non-MultiIndex instances, which results in improper groupings creation.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve correcting the condition blocks for handling non-MultiIndex instances and improving the logic for grouping creation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]

                    )
            elif level != 0 and level != -1:
                raise ValueError("level != 0 and level != -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
