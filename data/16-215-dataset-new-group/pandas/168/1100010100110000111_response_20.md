The buggy function `_get_grouper` has an issue with handling the `group_name` parameter when it is passed as a list. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to group by column name(s).

The bug occurs specifically when calling the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` method with `group_name` as a list. The function does not handle the case of `group_name` being a list of strings correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle group_name when it is a list, and ensure that it can correctly group by multiple column names when passed as a list.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    
    ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
    
        if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
            keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
            if all(k in obj for k in keys):
                return BaseGrouper(obj, keys, axis=axis)
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)
        else:
            raise ValueError("key must be a string or a list of strings")
```

This corrected function will handle the `group_name` being a list and correctly group by multiple column names when passed as a list.

By making this change, the function will be able to handle the `groupby` operation correctly, and the `KeyError` issue mentioned in the GitHub issue will be resolved.
