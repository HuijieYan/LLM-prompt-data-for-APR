To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The condition `is_tuple and is_hashable(key)` is not evaluating correctly, resulting in a warning being issued incorrectly in some cases where `key` is not a tuple.

2. The creation of the `groupings` list is failing to append any `Grouping` objects, resulting in an empty list being returned.

To address these issues, we can revise the function as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # other code remains the same...

    # Replace the condition 'is_tuple and is_hashable(key)' with 'isinstance(key, tuple) and is_hashable(key)'
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = isinstance(key, tuple) and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    # other code remains the same...

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # other code remains the same...

    # Create Grouping objects and add them to the groupings list
    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # other code remains the same...

        # if the grouper is obj[name]
        def is_in_obj(gpr, obj_name=None):
            try:
                if obj_name is None:
                    return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
                return id(gpr) == id(obj[obj_name])
            except Exception:
                return False

        if is_in_obj(gpr, obj_name='name'):
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)

        # other code remains the same...

        # Create the Grouping
        groupings.append(
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
        )

    # other code remains the same...
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle tuple and hashable key conditions and create the necessary `Grouping` objects to populate the `groupings` list.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
