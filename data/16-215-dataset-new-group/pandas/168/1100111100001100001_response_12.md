The issue with the provided function lies in the condition checks and the subsequent variable assignments within the function, producing incorrect data. The issue likely arises from these variable assignments not being properly structured due to the complex logic involved. It appears that the function is trying to ascertain the appropriate groupings by identifying appropriate indices for creating the grouper object.

To fix this bug, the function needs to undergo simplification, ensuring that the condition checks and variable assignments are accurate, thus producing the intended groups for the grouper. 

Below is the corrected version of the function.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # check for compatibility of the passed single level with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # process for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # process for MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper
```
