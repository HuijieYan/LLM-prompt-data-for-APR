The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to handling the `axis` parameter and groupings by column names, leading to a KeyError when trying to group along columns. The main issue seems to be the handling of column names when grouping along the specified axis.

The `_get_grouper` function should be fixed to properly handle column groupings and avoid the KeyError when grouping along columns.

To fix the bug, the section of the code that handles the grouping by column names should be reviewed and potentially modified to correctly interpret the column names when grouping along the specified axis.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # Case handling for grouping by column names
    elif axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            return obj[key], [], obj
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    else:
        warnings.warn("Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key.", FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = com.asarray_tuplesafe(key)
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # ... (remaining code)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This corrected version includes explicit handling for the case where `axis=1` and the `key` is a single column name. Instead of raising a KeyError, it directly returns the column as the grouper.

This should address the issue where grouping along columns was causing a KeyError and ensure that the grouping by column names is handled correctly.

By updating the logic to handle column grouping correctly, the corrected versions of the `_get_grouper` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
