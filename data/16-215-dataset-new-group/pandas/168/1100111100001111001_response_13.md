To fix the bug, we should focus on the variable `keys` and its relationship with `group_axis`. Change the initializers to assign `keys` as an empty list. Then, update how `keys` and `match_axis_length` are calculated depending on the input parameter `key`. Update the condition for `match_axis_length` to compare the length of `keys` with the length of `group_axis`. 

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    
    # Updated initializers to assign keys as an empty list
    keys = []

    # Updated how keys and match_axis_length are calculated
    if key is not None:
        # Handle key as a list of keys
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

The modification aligns `keys` with the input parameter `key` and appropriately deals with `match_axis_length`. This corrected version should fulfill all the expected cases.
