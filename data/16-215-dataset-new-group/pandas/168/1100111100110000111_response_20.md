## Analysis
The buggy function is `_get_grouper`. The error occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method. The error message indicates that a KeyError is raised when trying to group by columns. The GitHub issue confirms that the issue is with grouping by columns using the `groupby` method, as it doesn't offer implicit selection by column names.

The cause of the bug is related to the logic within the `_get_grouper` function that handles grouping by columns. The logic for handling column names is flawed, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The logic for handling column names within the `_get_grouper` function needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that it correctly handles grouping by column names. The code should be modified to properly handle the grouping by column names, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError.

## Bug Fix
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        if axis == 1:
            if isinstance(key, str):
                key = [key]
            key = list(obj.columns.intersection(key))
            level = None

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

The corrected version includes a modified logic to handle grouping by column names when the axis is set to 1. It checks if the key is a string or a list, and if the axis is 1. If so, it ensures that the key is converted to a list and then intersects with the columns of the DataFrame. This will prevent the KeyError when trying to group by columns.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the grouping by columns, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
