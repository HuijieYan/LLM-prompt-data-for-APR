Buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... code omitted ...
```

The problem appears to be with the condition `is_tuple and is_hashable(key)`.

This condition appears in the code that processes the key parameter. To ensure that the key is always a list of keys with or without a tuple input, the condition should be modified to:
```
if (
    isinstance(key, tuple)
    and (all(is_hashable(k) for k in key))
    and (all(k in obj for k in key) or not all(is_hashable(k) for k in key))
):
    msg = (
        "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
        "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
        "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
    )
    warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
    key = list(key)
```

This will address the issue with interpreting the tuple 'by' as a single or multiple keys. Hence, the corrected function will look like:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
    was_tup=False,
):
    mode = "single"
    if was_tup:
        if all(is_hashable(k) for k in key) and all(k in obj for k in key):
            mode = "multi"
        else:
            mode = "single"

    if mode == "multi":
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # ... code omitted ...
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
