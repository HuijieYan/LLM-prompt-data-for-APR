The buggy function is experiencing issues when trying to group along columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` argument. The function is not correctly handling the column names and is raising a KeyError even though the intent is to group by the "x" column label.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles the grouping by columns, specifically when analyzing the column names. The function is not correctly identifying the columns for grouping, resulting in a ValueError when attempting to group along columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the grouping of columns, ensuring that it identifies and processes the column names appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if key is not None and axis == 1 and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # Ensure key is always a list when grouping along columns

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By making the adjustment to ensure that the `key` parameter is always treated as a list when grouping along columns, the function will correctly handle the grouping operation.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the KeyError that occurs when trying to group along columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` argument.
