The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input key when it is a list of keys. When `group_name` is passed as a list, the error arises. The function assumes a single key instead of a list of keys.

To fix this bug, we need to make changes in the handling of the `key` input when it is passed as a list and implement the logic to create groupings for each key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # ... (code remains the same)

    # rest of the code for handling single key remains the same

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # Create a Grouping for each key, combined into a BaseGrouper
        groupings = []
        for gpr in key:
            if not isinstance(gpr, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)):
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid key value: {gpr}")

            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=None,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
        
        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # rest of the code for handling single key remains the same
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when the `key` input is a list or a tuple and will create a Grouping for each key, combined into a BaseGrouper.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
