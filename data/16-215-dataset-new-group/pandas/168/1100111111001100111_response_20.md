To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to identify the cause of the issue based on the described test cases and runtime variable values, and then provide a corrected version of the function. 

## Potential Error Location
The bug likely occurs within the portion of the code that processes the key and determines the grouping behavior.

## Cause of the Bug
Based on the failing tests and runtime variable values, it appears that the `keys` variable, derived from the `key` input parameter, only contains the string representation of a single key, not a list of keys as expected. This results in incorrect grouping behavior when trying to use `groupby` along the columns.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `keys` variable is correctly constructed as a list, even if a single key is provided. Additionally, we should review the portion of the code responsible for handling the key and confirm that it properly supports both single and multiple keys.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the identified buggy code, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function with the potential fix is provided below:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # check if the keys variable is a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # continue with the remaining code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we add a conditional check to ensure that the `keys` variable is properly constructed as a list, even if a single key is provided. This should address the issue where the grouping along columns fails when a single key is provided instead of a list of keys.
