The cause of the bug is that the `_get_grouper` function is failing to group along the columns when `axis=1` is specified. This is leading to a KeyError when trying to group by column name.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle grouping along the columns correctly when `axis=1` is passed.


Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_categorical_dtype, is_scalar, is_list_like, is_hashable
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_timedelta_like
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import BaseGrouper, Grouper, Grouping
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if key is None:  # Group by axis 1
        columns = obj.iloc[:, 0]  # Get column values
        key = columns
        level = None

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    else:
        # perform the grouping based on the key along columns
        single_key_groups = [obj[key]]
        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                single_key_groups,
                obj=obj,
                name=key,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
            )
        ]

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj
```

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function addresses the bug by correctly handling the grouping along the columns when `axis=1` is specified. It constructs the groupings and grouper based on the column key and returns the appropriate result when grouping along the columns.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to grouping along columns not working as expected.
