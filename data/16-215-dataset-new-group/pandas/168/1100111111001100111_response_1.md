The buggy function seems to have a logical error related to processing the `key` and `level` parameters, which causes it to fail when grouping along the columns. This is evident from the failed tests and the GitHub issue, where the function is expected to group by columns but raises a KeyError instead.

The cause of the bug appears to be in the logic related to handling column grouping, particularly in the handling of the `key` and `level` parameters when grouping along the axis. This causes the function to fail when creating the Grouping objects.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling column grouping needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the columns when grouping along the axis.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:  # Modified from obj.index.name to obj.columns.name
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # A passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling the `level` parameter and identifying the column names has been modified. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
