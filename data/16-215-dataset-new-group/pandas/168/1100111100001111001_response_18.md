## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect assignment of the `group_axis` value. This variable is expected to store a Pandas `Index` object representing the axis index of the input `obj` (which is a DataFrame). 

In the provided runtime inputs, the DataFrame `obj` has the following structure:
```
x  10  20  10  20
y                
0   0   1   2   3
1   4   5   6   7
0   8   9  10  11
```
The `group_axis` should represent the index of the columns, which is `Int64Index([10, 20, 10, 20], dtype='int64', name='x')`. However, the algorithm is internally setting `group_axis` to the axis index of the DataFrame instead of its columns.
This results in later calculations and comparisons using an incorrect `group_axis`, ultimately leading to further incorrect behavior. 

## The Solution Strategy
Listed below are the steps to fix the bug:
1. Determine the correct representation of the columns index of the DataFrame `obj`, and ensure that `group_axis` is assigned this value.
2. Review and possibly optimize the subsequent use of `group_axis` to ensure that the fixed value integrates correctly with the rest of the function.
3. Verify that the changes are effective and do not cause errors in other parts of the function.
4. Re-run the cases using the corrected function and verify that the expected outcomes are achieved.

## The Corrected Function
The corrected function to address this bug will incorporate the correct assignment of the `group_axis` variable as described above. Additionally, this function can review the entire implementation for possible optimizations.

The corrected function might look like the following:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    ... (function documentation and statements)

    """
    group_axis = obj if axis else obj.columns

    # the remaining unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
Please note that the remaining parts of the function will need to be reviewed, possibly optimized, and correctly integrated with the new assignment of `group_axis`. This corrected function should be used to re-run the test cases to verify the desired outcomes.
