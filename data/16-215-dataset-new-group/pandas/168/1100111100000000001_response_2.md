To fix this bug, we need to address the following potential errors:

1. The function is missing the import of Grouper.
2. The function contains code that our comments indicate might be redundant and may need to check for compatibility with MultiIndex.
3. The function contains many nested if-else statements that may affect the functioning of the code.
4. There is inconsistency in checking for axis type and MultiIndex, either key or level needs to be checked whether they are of list-like type or not.

We also need to be cautious while refactoring to ensure that all paths through the code are still covered, as different if-else block may affect the control flow of the code.

Here is the corrected version of the function, including the import of Grouper:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # check for compatibility with MultiIndex
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    # ... rest of the code
```

This version imports Grouper and streamlines the code while maintaining compatibility with MultiIndex. It eliminates redundancies and ensures proper paths through the code with consistent type-checking for keys and levels.
