## Analysis
The issue is related to the `groupby` function in pandas not offering implicit selection by column name(s) when specifying the `axis=1`. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised even though the intent is to group by columns, on the specified column label.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `is_in_axis` function and its usage for handling grouping by column names.
2. The condition for checking if the group axis is a MultiIndex and the subsequent handling of `level` and `key` variables.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of grouping by column names when the `axis=1` is specified. The function fails to properly recognize and handle the grouping by column labels, leading to a KeyError at the end.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the function handles grouping by column names correctly when `axis=1` is specified.
2. Check and correct the conditions and logic related to handling the `level` and `key` variables, especially when the group axis is a MultiIndex.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # replace the existing function code with the corrected code below

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)
        keys = key
        groupings = []

        for key in keys:
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    key,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,  # indicating it's in the axis
                )
            )

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj.columns):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        elif len(groupings) == 0:
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp))
            )

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (remaining existing function code)
```

This corrected function adds a specific check for `axis=1` and a list-like `key`. It creates the `groupings` based on the specified column keys and handles the case of grouping by columns correctly. The remaining existing function code is left unchanged.

By making these changes, the corrected function should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to grouping by column names with `axis=1`.
