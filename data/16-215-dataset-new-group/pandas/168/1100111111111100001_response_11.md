The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be that when `key` is passed as a list, the condition following it is not executed correctly. The function is designed to handle the keys passed as a list, but the logic does not properly account for this situation. To fix this, we need to properly handle the case when `key` is a list in the conditional logic of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if not any_arraylike and match_axis_length and level is None:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
                )
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

        levels = [level] * len(keys)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        levels = [level]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if `key` is a list and handle it separately.

By properly accounting for the `key` as a list case, the corrected function should solve the issue and pass the failing tests. The corrected function has conditional checks that handle both the scalar and list case for the `key`, ensuring the correct branching based on the type of input.
