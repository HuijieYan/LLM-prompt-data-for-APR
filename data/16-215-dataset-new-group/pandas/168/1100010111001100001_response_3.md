The issue within the `_get_grouper` function appears to be related to the processing of the keys when calculating the groupings. Specifically, there seems to be a problem with how the key is extracted from the `group_axis` using the `level` parameter and the subsequent processing of the extracted keys.

The function doesn't handle the case where `level` is a list or the case where `is_list_like` returns false. Also, in the if condition before `else` block, `obj.index.name != level` could be incorrect as the comparison between level and the index name may not be justified. Additionally, the nested if-else block for `level` could be revised to ensure that any multilevel index processing is appropriately handled.

To fix the bug, we will make the following changes:
1. Revise the conditions and logic for handling `level` and `group_axis` to ensure correct extraction of keys and handling of multi-level indices. The code block needs to be thoroughly tested to clarify exactly what action should be taken for each type of input.

Below is the corrected implementation for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Note: This corrected implementation is provided based on assumptions without the ability to test the solution
# Use with caution and conduct thorough testing before deployment

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # Revise the conditions and logic to handle level extraction from group_axis
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By implementing these changes, the function should be able to correctly extract keys from the `group_axis` based on the `level` parameter and handle multi-level indices appropriately. However, please note that this corrected implementation should be tested thoroughly to ensure it performs as expected and resolves the issue with the failing tests.
