The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when using `groupby` along the columns in some cases where the input `key` is a string or list of strings and the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle the input `key` when it is a string or list of strings, causing it to raise a KeyError. The issue is related to how the function processes the input and creates the Grouping objects for each key.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the input `key` when it is a string or list of strings, and creates the Grouping objects based on the column names.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # if the input key is a string or list of strings, create the Grouping objects
    if isinstance(key, str):
        keys = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        keys = key
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid group key type: {}".format(type(key)))

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for k in keys:
        if k in obj.columns:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=k,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)
        else:
            raise KeyError(k)

    # ... (continue with the rest of the function)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the cases where the input `key` is a string or list of strings, create the Grouping objects for each key based on the column names, and raise an error for invalid keys. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the grouping by columns and resolves the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub.
