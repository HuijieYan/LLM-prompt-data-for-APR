Taking into account the provided information, the buggy function appears to have an issue where it incorrectly processes the input parameters for grouping by columns. It fails to handle the case where the input parameter `key` is a string or a list of strings representing columns for grouping.

To resolve this issue, a strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the function to correctly identify the input parameter `key` as a string or list of strings representing column names for grouping. The function should then create groupings based on these columns and return the correct groupings for further processing. Additionally, the function should handle the scenarios where the input parameters `key` and `level` are provided for grouping by columns and levels and make appropriate validations for index and column names.

Below is the corrected version of the function based on the understanding of the identified bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # if the passed key is a string or a list of strings representing columns
    if isinstance(key, str) or (isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(col, str) for col in key)):
        if obj is None:
            raise ValueError("Object to group is missing.")
        
        if axis != 1:
            raise ValueError("Grouping by columns requires setting axis=1.")

        columns_to_group = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for column in columns_to_group:
            if column not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(f"Column '{column}' is not in the DataFrame.")

            ping = Grouping(
                obj[column],  # passing the column values as the grouper
                obj=obj,
                name=column,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    else:
        # ... (proceed with the remaining logic for other types of groupings)
```

Please replace the existing `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file with the corrected version provided above.

By making these changes, the function should correctly handle grouping by columns, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report and resolving the identified bug.
