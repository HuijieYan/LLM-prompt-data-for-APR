The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is causing an issue that prevents the grouping by column names when using `groupby` with the `axis=1` parameter. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the processing of the `key` and `level` parameters, as well as the logic for handling grouping by column names.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names when using `groupby` with the `axis=1` parameter. This is leading to a KeyError and preventing the grouping of columns by their names.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling grouping by column names needs to be revised. The function should correctly identify and process the column names as groupers when `axis=1`.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Removable if-block & else-block

        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Revised logic for handling level
            if not isinstance(level, list):
                level = [level]
                
            key = level
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Revised logic for handling groupers
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        keys = list(obj.columns)

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)

    # Revised grouping logic
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):

        # Handle grouping by column names
        if gpr in obj.columns:
            in_axis, name, level, gpr = True, gpr, level, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)

            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis, gpr, obj=obj, name=name, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=in_axis
                )
            )

            groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(
            Grouping(
                Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)
            )
        )

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling groupers has been revised to correctly identify and process the column names as groupers when `axis=1` is used. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
