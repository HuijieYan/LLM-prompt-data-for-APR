## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`. The issue seems to be related to grouping along columns when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` argument. The failing test case indicates that when grouping along columns, the function is returning unexpected results.

The GitHub issue confirms that when using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` argument and providing column names for grouping, a KeyError is raised, which is not the expected behavior.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the `_get_grouper` function include the conditionals related to grouping along columns, handling of levels, keys, and the creation of the `BaseGrouper`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of column names and grouping along columns when creating the BaseGrouper. The function seems to be incorrectly interpreting the 'by' argument as a list of keys rather than a single key when grouping along columns using `axis=1`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_grouper` function correctly interprets the 'by' argument as a single key when grouping along columns. Additionally, the function should handle the provided column names properly to create the BaseGrouper.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Modified the condition for MultiIndex instance check to handle level values
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Adjusted the condition for handling level as a list-like object
            if is_list_like(level) or isinstance(level, str) or level != 0:
                raise ValueError("Unsupported level parameter")

    # Additional handling for grouping along columns
    if axis == 1 and is_scalar(key) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    # Ensure key is a list if it's not None
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
    # (Remaining code)

```

In this corrected version of the function, we added additional handling for grouping along columns by checking if the key provided is a scalar and exists in the columns of the DataFrame. If so, we set the key to the corresponding column. We also ensured that the 'key' parameter is treated as a list if it's not None, which helps in handling the 'by' argument correctly.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` argument works as expected when providing column names for grouping.
