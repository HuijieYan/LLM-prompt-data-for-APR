The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_grouper` is not handling the input parameter `key` correctly when it is a list. The function wrongly treats a list input as a single key, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to access the group specified by the list of keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case when the `key` input is a list, and iterate over each element in the list to create the appropriate Grouping objects for each key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # Create Grouping objects for each key in the list
        groupings = []
        exclusions = set()  # Use set for efficient lookups

        for k in key:
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    k,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.add(k)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, list(exclusions), obj

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)

```

By iterating over each element in the `key` list and creating Grouping objects for each key, we ensure that the function handles the case of a list of keys as expected.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle both the single key and list of keys input cases, and the provided test cases should pass without raising a `KeyError` error.
