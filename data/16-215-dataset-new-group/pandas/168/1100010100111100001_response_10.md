The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the conditional statement for setting the `level` and `key` variables when `is_list_like` is True in the `MultiIndex` block of the input DataFrame. Specifically, it fails to handle the case when `level` is a length-one list-like object and no value for `key` is provided. This causes the error "KeyError: 'x'" to be raised in the failing test cases involving axis 1.

I will fix the bug by modifying the conditional statement in the `MultiIndex` block to correctly handle the assignment of `level` and `key` when `is_list_like` is True and the length of `level` is equal to 1.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                # Set key to level value when key is None and level is scalar
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
            else:
                # Raise a ValueError for multiple levels in MultiIndex
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
        else:
            # ... (previous code remains the same)
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

With this modification, the potential issue with setting the `level` and `key` variables when handling a MultiIndex object with a single level is addressed, and it should resolve the KeyError in the failing test cases.

This corrected `_get_grouper` function should now handle both single level and MultiIndex cases properly and pass the failing test cases.
