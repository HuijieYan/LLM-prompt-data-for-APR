The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causing the `KeyError` in the failing test is due to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list in the function.

The `key` is initially expected to be a single object, but in the failing test, it is being passed as a list. The code does not handle lists properly when processing the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle lists of keys properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original function until this point

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original function
    # ...
```

In this modified version, we check if the `key` is not a list, then we create a list containing the `key`. Otherwise, we assign the `key` directly to the `keys` variable.

This modification allows the function to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly.

After making this change, the modified function should be able to handle the list of keys passed in the failing test and resolve the `KeyError` issue.
