There is a bug in the `_get_grouper` function, where some of the error handling related code blocks might not be functioning as intended. Specifically, the code logic related to determining the 'level' and 'key' based on different types of input. These include the block that handles 'level' and 'key' when 'group_axis' is not a MultiIndex. Another potential issue arises in the logic that handles keys being passed as tuples.

To fix this bug, it is important to modify the logic related to 'level' and 'key' handling when 'group_axis' is not a MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1 and is_scalar(level[0]):
                level = level[0]
            elif key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, the code to handle the 'level' and 'key' based on different types of input has been streamlined to ensure proper validation and handling. The main changes are made in the block that previously handled 'level' and key' when 'group_axis' is not a MultiIndex. The code is simplified to allow for specific checks and conversions.
