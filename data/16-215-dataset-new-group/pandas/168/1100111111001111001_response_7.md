The bug in the function `_get_grouper` appears to be caused by the values of the variables `keys`, `match_axis_length`, and the process itself for constructing the `keys` list when the level is empty, which leads to unintended behavior when an empty list is passed for the level parameter. The `gpr` variable seems to be handled incorrectly inside the function. To fix the bug, you need to make adjustments to properly handle the `level` parameter when it's an empty list and ensure that `keys` is populated correctly based on the level parameter.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (initial code remains the same)

    # populate keys list based on the level parameter
    keys = [key] if level is None else level if len(level) > 0 else [key]

    # rest of the function's code as is
```

The correction should handle the behavior when the level parameter is an empty list, ensuring that the `keys` list is populated correctly, and the subsequent behavior in the function should work as expected based on the corrected logic.

This corrected function should resolve the issues highlighted in the failing test cases.
