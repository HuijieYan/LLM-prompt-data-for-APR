The key issue in the buggy function is the condition to initialize the `key` value when `level` is not None. The current conditional logic doesn't cover all the cases when the input parameters contain a MultiIndex.

The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of MultiIndex instances in the initializations of `key` and `level`. This leads to incorrect grouping and results in a KeyError when the dataframe is grouped along columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic to handle MultiIndex instances appropriately, ensuring that the `key` and `level` values are correctly initialized based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                elif nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The updated code includes additional checks and conditions to correctly handle the initialization of `key` and `level` when dealing with MultiIndex instances.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the grouping along columns correctly and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected function should be able to pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue.
