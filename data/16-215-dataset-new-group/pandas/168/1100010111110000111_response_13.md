The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is causing the KeyError when the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function is executed. This issue is related to the incorrect grouping when using the `groupby` function with `axis=1` and a single column name. The buggy function is not correctly identifying the column name and is therefore throwing a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when grouping by a single column name with `axis=1`. We should remove unnecessary code that is causing confusion and simplify the logic to correctly identify the column name.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = obj[key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

With this updated code, the function correctly handles the case when a single column name is provided for grouping with `axis=1`. This should resolve the KeyError issue and the function should pass the failing test.

By making this change, the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function should no longer throw a KeyError when executing the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` line.

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should resolve the GitHub issue titled "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)". The fix ensures that the `groupby` function correctly handles grouping by a single column name with `axis=1`.

Please note that this fix assumes the rest of the codebase is functioning correctly. If there are multiple functions at play, it would be beneficial to run the entire test suite to ensure that the fix does not introduce any regressions.
