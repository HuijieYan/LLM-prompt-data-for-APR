The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is likely causing the issue when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1`. The bug seems to be related to the handling of column names when grouping along columns.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is handling the grouping by column names (`axis=1`) when it should be providing an implicit selection by column name(s). This is causing unexpected behavior and a KeyError for column names as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_grouper` function can correctly handle the grouping by column names and apply the grouping operation along columns. The function should correctly parse the column names and perform the grouping operation, resulting in the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        key = obj.columns[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [
            key
        ]  # convert a single key to a list to ensure that processing is consistent
    else:
        keys = key

    # create the Grouping
    # allow us to passing the actual Grouping as the gpr
    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            key,
            obj=obj,
            name=key,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        for key in keys
    ]

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1` and apply the grouping operation along columns. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the `_get_grouper` function, and it assumes certain behavior based on the description and failing test. Further testing and validation may be necessary based on the specific behavior and requirements of the `groupby` operation in Pandas.
