The issue in the buggy function is due to a KeyError being raised when trying to group by a column name using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`. The function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names, which results in an unexpected error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly recognizing the column names for grouping when using `axis=1`. This is evident from the KeyError being raised when trying to group by the column name "x". The function is not handling the grouping by column names properly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function recognizes the column names and performs the grouping accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        levels = [None] * len(keys)

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[gpr],
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    else:
        # handle other cases as per the existing function
        # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, when `axis=1` and a column name is provided for grouping, it correctly creates the Grouping object for each column name and returns the grouper, exclusions, and obj.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1` and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the function behave as expected.

Please note that this is a partial fix and may need further testing with other use cases to ensure it covers all scenarios accurately.
