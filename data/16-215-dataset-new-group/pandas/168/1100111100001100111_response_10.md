The bug appears to be in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. However, it seems to be failing to properly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`.

The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when attempting to group by columns, even when the column name is specified in the `by` argument.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`, ensuring that the column names are correctly processed and used for grouping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
# corrected version of the _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr in keys:
        if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
            in_axis = gpr in obj.columns
            level = axis
            name = gpr
        else:
            in_axis = True
            level = None
            name = gpr

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the grouping by columns when `axis=1` and should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Please note that the corrected function has been simplified and modified to explicitly handle the case when grouping by columns with `axis=1`.

I hope this helps to fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue!
