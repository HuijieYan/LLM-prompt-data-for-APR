### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, the code checks for the parameters `key` and `level` and creates groupings based on them. However, for the failing tests, the bug is triggered by the condition that determines whether the passed `key` parameter is a list. Since this check is incorrect, the bug causes an incorrect grouping, leading to a KeyError during the execution.

### Bug Fix
1. Remove the faulty condition of checking if `key` is a list and initializing `keys` and `match_axis_length` based on that condition. This is unnecessary and causes incorrect groupings.

2. After the removal of the wrong condition, directly check for the other types of callable, Grouper, and array-like objects.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function code)
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Other code for level assignment ...
            pass

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # The removal of the wrong condition allows direct checking for other types
    # and will then handle the different types of input for key correctly.
    if not any(callable(key) or isinstance(key, dict) for key in [key]):
        # Handle the actual grouper obj[key]
        # Rest of the function code ...
    # ... (rest of the function code)
```
After fixing the bug, the failing tests should pass without any KeyErrors.
