# Fixing the buggy function

The cause of the bug in the `_get_grouper` function might be related to the slicing and checking of the input keys. The function is designed to create and return a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. However, in its current form, there are several conditional checks and processes that could lead to unintended side effects or incorrect outputs.

One potential issue is with how the function handles the input keys. The conditional statements and checks for various types of input keys (lists, tuples, callable, groupers, etc.) could lead to confusion in the output. Also, the processing of levels and keys might not be consistent, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to:

1. Simplify the conditional checks for different types of input keys.
2. Ensure consistent handling of levels and keys, especially for MultiIndex instances.
3. Remove redundant checks and processes.
4. Ensure that the function creates BaseGrouper and handles key validation properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        if is_scalar(level):
            level = [level]

    # process keys and levels
    keys, levels = [], []
    if key is not None:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr, lvl in zip(keys, levels):
        # process each key and level
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            level=lvl,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed
        )
        
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the function handles the keys and levels in a simplified and consistent manner. It creates Grouping objects for each key and level and appends them to the `groupings` list. Then, it creates the `BaseGrouper` and returns the result.

Please note that the body of the `Grouping` class and some error handling inside the `_get_grouper` function are ignored. The provided corrected version focuses on the key processing and grouper creation.
