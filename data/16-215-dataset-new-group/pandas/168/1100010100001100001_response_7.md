The function `_get_grouper` is meant to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It tries to figure out the passed-in references and then create a `Grouping` for each one, combined into a `BaseGrouper`.

After analyzing the buggy function and the provided runtime input/output values, it's clear that the function is not functioning as intended and is not creating the grouping objects correctly. The problem seems to arise during the process of reading the `key` and `level` inputs and creating the `groupings` list. The block of code responsible for this behavior involves multiple conditional checks and assignments that are incorrectly handled.

The correction strategy involves refactoring the conditional checks and assignments within the problematic code block to ensure that the correct conditions are met for each part, thereby creating valid `groupings` as intended.

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing comments and docstring remain unchanged)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # refactored code block
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            # made the subsequent code block more concise and meaningful
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (rest of the function unchanged)
```

By refactoring the conditional checks and assignments as shown above, we aim to ensure that the function creates the desired `groupings` list correctly.
