To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to include the logic to handle grouping by column names correctly. Based on the failing test and the expected input/output values, the bug seems to be related to the identification and handling of column names for grouping.

To address this issue, it's necessary to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly process the input parameters related to column grouping. This involves ensuring that the column names are properly identified and utilized for the grouping operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        key = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) if k in obj else k for k in key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (remaining existing code)
```

The modification ensures that when `axis` is specified as 1 (indicating column-wise grouping), and the `key` is a list of strings, the function correctly identifies the column names and converts them to their corresponding positions within the columns. This addresses the issue of the function incorrectly handling column names for grouping.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the column names for grouping, allowing it to pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" by ensuring that the function correctly handles column names for grouping.
