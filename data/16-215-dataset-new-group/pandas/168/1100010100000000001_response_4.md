The bug of this function could be located at the conditional decision-making blocks, such as the blocks used to identify the level, making selections based on the type of axis, and the use of equality checks for strings. It is possible that the control logic in these blocks is flawed, which might result in unexpected outcomes.

To fix the bug, the conditional decision-making logic within the function should be critically analyzed and altered as necessary. Additionally, potential issues with the type of objects used and the comparisons made should be examined, and any flawed assumptions regarding the input data should be rectified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Fix the buggy function to create and return a BaseGrouper.
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Updated level processing based on the type of group_axis
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Validate level processing for MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Process non-MultiIndex objects
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    # Check if level name matches the index name
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # Create BaseGrouper if key is an instance of Grouper
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # Return the key if it's already a BaseGrouper
        return key, [], obj
    else:
        # rest of the function logic
        # ...
```

Please note that this is a partial correction since it is not clear where the input objects "Grouper" and "Grouping" are defined and how they are supposed to be handled within the function. The remaining portion of the function logic that isn't shown in the code snippet provided should be thoroughly analyzed and corrected based on the findings.
