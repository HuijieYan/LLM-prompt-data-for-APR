## Potential Error Locations and Explanation of Bug

### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition checks and transformations related to handling `level` and `key` variables may be causing the bug.
2. The conditions and warnings related to the `key` variable may also contribute to the bug.
3. The conditions related to identifying the type of `key` and its processing could be potential error locations.

### Explanation of Bug
The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `key` and `level` variables, which are used to determine the grouping behavior. The issue arises when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError even though the intention is to group by the specified columns.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect checks and transformations related to the `level` and `key` variables within the `_get_grouper` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review and simplify the conditions related to handling `level` and `key` variables to ensure appropriate processing for grouping by columns.
2. Update the conditions and warnings related to the `key` variable to correctly handle grouping by columns.
3. Refactor the code to ensure that the `axis=1` parameter works as intended for column-wise grouping.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # (Previous code remains unchanged for brevity)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                if axis == 1:  # Adjust for column-wise grouping
                    key = obj[level]
                    level = None
                elif axis == 0:
                    key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                    level = None

        else:
            # (Previous code remains unchanged)

    # (Remaining code remains unchanged for brevity)
```

This adjusted version of the function includes a specific condition to handle column-wise grouping when the `level` variable is not None. This ensures that the `key` variable is appropriately set for column-wise grouping by using the column names from the DataFrame.

The suggested fix aims to address the incorrect handling of `level` and `key` variables, specifically when grouping by columns using the `axis=1` parameter. By adjusting the logic for column-wise grouping, the corrected version should resolve the issue and ensure that the `groupby` function works as intended for column-wise grouping.
