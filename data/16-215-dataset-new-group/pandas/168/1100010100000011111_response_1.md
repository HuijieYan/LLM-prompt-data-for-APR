The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing to correctly group by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This is contrary to the intended behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue, which expects the groupby to work correctly for columns using the `axis` parameter.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function not treating the column names correctly when `axis` is set to 1. Instead, it's treating the column names as index labels, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_grouper` function to handle grouping by columns properly when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:  # Grouping by columns
        if key is None:
            keys = list(obj.columns)
        else:
            keys = [key]

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for key in keys:
            index = np.arange(len(obj))
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    com._ensure_index(obj.columns),
                    index,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=key,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            exclusions.append(key)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Otherwise, continue with the default behavior for other axes
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, the function correctly identifies the column names and creates the appropriate groupings before returning the result. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1, as expected by the GitHub issue.
