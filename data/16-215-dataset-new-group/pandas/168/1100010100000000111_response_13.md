The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is causing an issue where grouping by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1` is not working as expected. The function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names, leading to a KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

The bug seems to be related to the way the function is handling the `key` and `obj` parameters when grouping by columns. The code does not properly handle the case when grouping by column names, leading to the KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the grouping by column names and create the appropriate groupings for columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1:
        return BaseGrouper(obj.columns, [Grouping(obj.columns, obj, name=key)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        # Validate and other code for grouping by index
        # ... (remaining code for grouping by index)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a condition to handle the case when `axis` is 1, indicating grouping by columns. When `axis` is 1, we create a `BaseGrouper` with the columns as the group axis and create a single `Grouping` for the specified key (column name).

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and correctly handle grouping by columns when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`.
