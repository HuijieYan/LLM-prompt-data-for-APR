The issue in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the creation of the `groupings` list. The loop for `groupings` does not correctly identify the type of the input `key`. It incorrectly handles the `key` as a list, leading to an empty `groupings` list and then raising a `ValueError` "No group keys passed!".

To fix the bug, we can update the code to handle the case where the `key` is a list. We should iterate through each item in the `keys` list, which will contain each element from the `key` list as a separate grouping. Based on the number of items in `keys`, we can iterate through them and create groupings accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # start the loop based on the type of key
    if not isinstance(key, list):  # handle the previous cases
        keys = [key]
    else:  # handle the case where the key is a list
        keys = key
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # check the type of gpr and perform the required operations

    # remaining code...
```

With this correction, the loop will correctly handle the input `key` as a list and create groupings based on its elements, ensuring that the `groupings` list is populated with meaningful values. This should fix the bug.

With the corrected version applied, the failing test cases (used in the analysis) should now pass without raising a `ValueError` "No group keys passed!".
