Considering each of the error cases, the recurrent problem is related to the determination of the key and the conditions for detecting indices. The bug appears when checking the condition for the passed key, and how the values should be handled.

After analyzing the buggy function, it's apparent that the conditions to ensure the presence of the key value within the index in the data structure are not properly set. The conditions for distinguishing between gpr values when checking for presence and the direct key names should be adjusted.

The function should be fixed by adjusting the code inside the loop and improving the checks for the types of keys and groupers. For instance, the conditions `is_in_axis(gpr)` and `is_in_obj(gpr)` could be improved to handle the `list` type of inputs correctly. 

Below, you'll find the corrected function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (code before the problematic area)

    # if the actual grouper should be obj[key]
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if (
            isinstance(key, str)
            and not _is_label_like(key)
            and not hasattr(obj, "columns")
            and key in obj
        ):
            obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
            return True
        
        return False

    # if the grouper is obj[name]
    def is_in_obj(gpr):
        if (
            isinstance(gpr, Series)
            and gpr.name in obj
            and id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
        ):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # ... (continued code)

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)
            continue

        if is_in_axis(gpr):  # df.groupby('name')
            if validate and gpr in obj:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)
            continue
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)
        
        # (rest of the loop and returning grouper logic)
```

The adjustments mentioned above address the determinations for `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions, considering the correct types for the provided keys. This should resolve the issues presented in each of the problem cases.

After validating the fixed function, it's suggested to run the previously failing tests to ensure that the corrected function is correctly implemented and provides the expected output.
