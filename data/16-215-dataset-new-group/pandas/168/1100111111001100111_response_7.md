The buggy function seems to be causing issues with grouping by columns when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This is evident from the failing test cases provided.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the `groupings` list not being populated correctly within the `_get_grouper` function. This incomplete population of the `groupings` list is leading to incorrect results when grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `groupings` list is populated correctly with the desired columns for grouping. Additionally, the condition checks related to multi-indices and the handling of keys should be reviewed and modified as necessary to handle the grouping by columns appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Populate the groupings list with the desired columns for grouping
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if isinstance(key, str) and key in group_axis:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                key,
                obj=obj,
                name=key,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should address the issues with grouping by columns and ensure that the `groupings` list is populated correctly, leading to the expected output and resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.
