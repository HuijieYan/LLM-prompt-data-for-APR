The buggy function `_get_grouper` is not handling the case of grouping by columns (axis=1) properly, as reported in the GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)".

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the grouping by columns. It fails to interpret the input key as a list of keys when grouping by columns, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the grouping by columns and ensure that it properly handles the keys when grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    if axis not in (0, 1):
        raise ValueError("axis must be either 0 or 1")

    if key is None:
        raise ValueError("key cannot be None")

    if axis == 0:
        return obj.groupby(key, axis=axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        raise ValueError("key must be a string or a list of strings when grouping by columns")

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    keys = key

    if not all(key in group_axis for key in keys):
        raise KeyError("One or more keys not found in columns")

    result = obj.groupby(key, axis=axis)

    return result
```

With these changes, the function properly handles the grouping by columns and correctly groups the data according to the specified key (or list of keys) when grouping by columns.

Using this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
