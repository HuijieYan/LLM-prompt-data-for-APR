The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is not parsing the `group_name` parameter correctly when it is a list. This is causing the failing test case to throw an error when `group_name` is a list, as it is not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `group_name` is a list and modify the function to correctly group by the specified columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = [key]
        
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    
    for key in keys:
        in_axis = True
        name = None
        level = None
        if key == level:
            exceptions.append(key)
        elif not isinstance(key, Grouper):
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    key,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=name,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=in_axis,
                )
            )

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should fix the issue and pass the failing test case.
