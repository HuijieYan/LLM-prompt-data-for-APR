```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,  # Make sure to correctly handle level
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            ...  # remaining code
    # remaining code
```
In this function, specify the correct actions for the given level before the remaining code to resolve the bug and ensure that the function produces the expected output values based on the runtime input values.

Given the available information, it is not feasible to make accurate corrections to the entire function. This should be accomplished by following the same approach provided for fixing the part of the function.
