The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function. The function tries to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This involves multiple steps including validating group keys and axis compatibility, creating Groupings for each key, and combining them into a BaseGrouper.

The error message indicates that a KeyError is raised, specifically for the group key 'x', when attempting to create the groupings. This occurs in the part of the code where it checks whether the group key is in the axis or in the object.

To fix this bug, the code should be altered to handle the case where the group key is a list. It should iterate through the list and create groupings for each key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            groupings.append(Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=k,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=(k in obj),  # Check if k is in obj's columns
            ))
            exclusions.append(k)

        if not groupings:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        
        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # The existing code for handling single key, Grouper, and BaseGrouper remains unchanged
    # ...

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where the group key is a list, and it will create a Grouping for each key, combined into a BaseGrouper. This should resolve the KeyError when trying to create the groupings for the group keys.
