The GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" describes the problem with using the `groupby()` function with the `axis=1` parameter to group along columns by column name(s). The issue states that when trying to group by columns, it raises a KeyError even though the intent is to group by column label. The expected output is a dataframe with the provided index but grouped and summed along the specified columns.

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function involves the processing of the `key` and `level` parameters when trying to group along columns using the `axis=1` parameter. There are validations and checks for the key, level, and group_axis, and the code does not handle the grouping of columns by name correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `key` and `level` parameters are processed when `axis=1` in the `groupby()` operation to correctly handle the column names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        level = key
        key = None

    if isinstance(level, str):
        if obj.columns.name != level:
            raise ValueError(
                "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
            )
    elif level is not None:
        raise ValueError("level should be a column name when grouping along columns")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case when `axis=1` and `key` is a list of column names. We also check for the level parameter and raise a ValueError if it is not None, indicating that it should be a column name when grouping along columns.

This should resolve the issue and allow the `groupby()` function to correctly group along columns using the column names.
