The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function within the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The error message indicates a KeyError when the function is called from the test `test_groupby_axis_1` in `pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py`. The function fails when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list, such as `['x']`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle a list of group keys properly. When `group_name` is passed as a list, the function does not iterate over each item in the list as expected, and instead raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle a list of group keys. We can iterate over each item in the list and create a BaseGrouper for each key, combined into a final BaseGrouper.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for k in keys:
        # handle each key individually
        if isinstance(k, (list, tuple)):
            raise ValueError("Passing a list of keys is not supported")

        gpr = k  # set gpr to the current key

        # logic for handling single key remains unchanged
        # ...

        # create the Grouping for the current key
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=level, 
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
        )
        
        groupings.append(ping)

    # ... (remaining part of the function remains unchanged)

    # create the final BaseGrouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both single key and list key inputs properly.

After making these changes, the `test_groupby_axis_1` test should pass without raising any `KeyError` exceptions.
