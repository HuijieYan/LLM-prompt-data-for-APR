The buggy function is `_get_grouper`, which is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The issue is that when using `groupby` with `axis=1` to group by columns, it may raise a KeyError even though the input is a valid column name. The function fails the test `test_groupby_axis_1` by not correctly grouping the DataFrame along the columns when applying the `groupby` operation.

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function can be found in the code related to creating the Grouping objects for each key. Specifically, the handling of the keys, levels, and groupings may be leading to incorrect grouping behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the code for handling keys, levels, and groupings is not correctly identifying and creating the Grouping objects for each key when using `groupby` with `axis=1`. This leads to incorrect grouping and results in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the keys, levels, and groupings are correctly identified and created for the columns when performing `groupby` with `axis=1`. Additionally, the handling of MultiIndex and single level indices needs to be modified to ensure proper grouping behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if level == group_axis.name or level in group_axis.names:
            key = group_axis

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if obj.columns.isin([gpr]).any():
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
        else:
            in_axis, name = False, None

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly identify and create the Grouping objects for the columns when using `groupby` with `axis=1`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and make the test `test_groupby_axis_1` pass successfully.
