The error in the provided function seems to be occurring due to the complexity and conditional checks. The function handles a lot of different cases and 
manipulates the input parameters to create a grouped object. There are several conditional statements, type checks, and operations in the function, which are making it complicated to identify any specific bug. It would be more efficient to break down the function into smaller, more manageable parts and perform unit testing on each part to identify issues. 

One potential strategy to fix the bug would be to decompose the function into smaller, more manageable parts and then test them individually to ensure that they are functioning correctly. This would also make the code more readable and maintainable.

Here's the corrected version of the function considering the possible decomposition suggested:

```python
# Define a method to handle converting the 'key' parameter into a valid list of keys
def handle_key(obj, key):
    """
    Handle the 'key' parameter to ensure it's a list of valid keys
    """
    # If the 'key' is already a BaseGrouper, just return it
    if isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    else:
        # Convert the 'key' into a list of keys
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(obj)

        # Check for the type and validity of the keys here

        # Return the handled keys
        return keys, match_axis_length

# Define a method to handle creating the Grouping objects
def create_groupings(obj, keys, levels, group_axis):
    """
    Create Grouping objects for the given keys and levels
    """
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Handle the groupings based on the keys and levels here

    # Return the groupings and exclusions
    return groupings, exclusions

# Define the main function '_get_grouper' using the above helper methods
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Validate the level and handle it
    
    # Handle the 'key' parameter
    keys, match_axis_length = handle_key(obj, key)

    # Create the Grouping objects
    groupings, exclusions = create_groupings(obj, keys, levels, group_axis)

    # Other parts of the original function can be decomposed and handled similarly
