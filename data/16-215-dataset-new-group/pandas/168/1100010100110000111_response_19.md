The issue arises from the `_get_grouper` function in the `grouper.py` file in the pandas library. The function fails to correctly identify and group by columns when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError being raised when attempting to group by column name(s). 

To address this issue, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by columns when the `groupby` method is invoked with the `axis=1` parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, str):  # Explicitly handle the case where key is a string (column name)
        key = [key]  # Convert the string key to a list
        
    if axis == 1 and all(k in obj.columns for k in key):  # Grouping by columns
        keys = [obj[k] for k in key]
    else:
        keys = [key]
    
    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr, level in zip(keys, levels):
        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                (
                    "Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis})"
                    " must be same length".format(
                        len_gpr=len(gpr), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                    )
                )
            )
        
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,  # Assume the groupers are always in the axis for column grouping
            )
        )
        
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function now includes handling for grouping by columns and correctly constructs the `groupings` list. It addresses the issue where a KeyError is raised when trying to group by column names. It also ensures that the keys are converted to a list if they are of type string and handles the case where the groupings are in the axis for column grouping.

With these corrections, the failing test cases reported in the GitHub issue should pass successfully. This fix resolves the issue of the `groupby` method not offering implicit selection by column name(s) when using `axis=1`.
