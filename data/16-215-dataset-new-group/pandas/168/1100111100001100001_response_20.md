The buggy function has a lot of conditional checks and variable initializations. The issue arises from subsetting the `key` for different conditions, which should be handled separately. This leads to a misalignment of the logic, causing the function to fail under different circumstances.

The main issue causing the bug appears to be in the `key` handling and validation logic. The function tries to handle single `key` and `level` values, lists of `key` and `level` values, and several other conditional checks in the later part of the function. This complexity results in incorrect variable assignments and leads to the improper creation of `groupings`. The alignment between the conditionals, variable assignments, and the subsequent use of those variables is the core reason for the bug.

To fix the bug, consider restructuring the conditional checks and variable assignments to handle `key` and `level` independently. Additionally, ensure that the subsequent processing of the variables aligns with their respective data types and expected values.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# import statements are unchanged

# corrected buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # update the code block as per the specific conditional requirement
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # adjust the code block for non-MultiIndex condition
            if is_list_like(level):
                # update based on the conditional check
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            # Update this part based on the condition checks
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the code remains the same for processing the groupings, exclusions, etc.
```

This fix involves restructuring the conditional checks while handling `key` and `level` to ensure proper alignment and processing of the subsequent variables. This way, the issues arising from mishandling different conditions related to `key` and `level` variables are addressed.
