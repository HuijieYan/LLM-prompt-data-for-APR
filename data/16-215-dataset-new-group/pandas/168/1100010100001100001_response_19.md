The bug in the `_get_grouper` function likely stems from the incorrect assignment of the `keys` variable. The function mistakenly assigns a single key string to the `keys` variable in Case 1, Case 2, Case 5, and Case 6, which should be an array-like object instead as specified by the type of the `key` parameter. 

In the other cases, it's unclear whether `keys` should be an array-like object due to no error values. However, in each case, `any_arraylike` is identified as false, which suggests a problem with the evaluation of `key` in each case. This may represent a common underlying issue that's causing the function to process a single key instead of an array-like object, leading to the failures.

To fix the bug, edit the function to correctly assign the input `key` parameter to the `keys` variable as an array-like object. Specifically, replace any direct reference to `key` with checking if it's an array-like object, and proceed accordingly. By making this change, the function should properly process the input `key` parameter and resolve the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = ensure_categorical(key) if is_list_like(key) else [key]

    # rest of the function...
}
```

By updating the function to ensure that `keys` is assigned an array-like object as necessary, it should properly handle the input and resolve the bug.
