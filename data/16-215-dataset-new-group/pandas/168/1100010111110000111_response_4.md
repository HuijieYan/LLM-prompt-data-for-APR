The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing to handle the case where `group_name` is a list of strings when using `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` in the test function `test_groupby_axis_1`. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised, indicating that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by columns when `group_name` is a list.

The function is failing to correctly handle the case where `group_name` is a list of strings when grouping by columns. This is evident from the error message and the failing test, as well as the GitHub issue that has been reported.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when `group_name` is a list of strings for grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    
    for gpr in keys:
        groupings.append(
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,  # always True for groupings by columns
            )
        )
        exclusions.append(gpr)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles the case when `group_name` is a list of strings for grouping by columns, ensuring that no `KeyError` is raised.

This fix should address the bug identified in the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
