The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causes a KeyError when trying to group by column name(s) using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. The code fails to handle the grouping by columns correctly, resulting in the KeyError.

The bug arises from the `_get_grouper` function's handling of the groupings by columns, especially when determining the key and groupings for the data. This function does not correctly handle the grouping by column names, leading to the KeyError.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to properly handle the grouping by column names and generate the appropriate key and grouping for the data. It needs to correctly identify and create the Grouping for each column when grouping along the columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        keys = obj.columns
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        keys = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = list(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key for grouping")

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        in_axis = True
        name = key
        gpr = obj[key]
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should properly handle the grouping by column name(s) when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass.
