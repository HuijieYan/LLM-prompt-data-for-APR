## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, (str, tuple)):
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            key = list(key)
        key = [key]

    if not all(k in obj.columns for k in key):
        raise KeyError("One or more keys not found in columns")

    keys = [obj[k] for k in key]
    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            k,
            obj=obj,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
        ) for k in keys
    ]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

The corrected version of the function includes changes to correctly handle the grouping by columns when passing a column name or list of column names to the `groupby` function. It checks if the passed keys are found in the columns and then creates the `BaseGrouper` accordingly. This updated version addresses the bug and should fix the issue reported on GitHub as well.
