The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of `group_name` when using the `groupby` function. When `group_name` is a list, the function `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` results in a KeyError: 'x'. This indicates that the grouping logic within the `get_grouper` function is not handling the list input correctly.

The potential error locations within the `_get_grouper` function are related to the processing of the `group_name` when it is a list. It seems that there is an issue with the handling of the list input and the subsequent key-related operations.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve identifying the specific section in the `_get_grouper` function where the processing of a list as `group_name` causes an issue. This might require modifying the logic for handling the `group_name` input, particularly when it is a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        if isinstance(level, list):
            level = level[0]

        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
        level = None

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when `level` is a list and take the first element for further processing. This modification should address the issue with the list input for the `group_name`.
