To fix the issue with the `_get_grouper` function, it is important to address the portion of code that handles the grouping by columns when the `axis=1` parameter is used. The issue described in the GitHub post "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" is related to the operation `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` raising a `KeyError` even though "x" is a column name.

It appears that the issue is caused by mishandling when processing the `groupby` operation for columns on `axis=1`. The `_get_grouper` function needs to properly detect and handle the axis parameter to correctly perform the grouping operation based on the input column names.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name of the columns"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

    # Create the Groupings for each key
    groupings = [
        Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            name=gpr,
            obj=obj,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        for gpr in keys
    ]

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling for `axis=1` and the grouping by columns is modified to accurately identify the column names and perform the grouping operation accordingly. The operation `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` should now work as expected without raising a `KeyError`.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
