The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of grouping by column names when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. 

The issue on GitHub is related to the fact that the `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` call raises a KeyError even though "x" is a column name.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the grouping by column names when `axis=1` is specified. This results in a KeyError being raised when attempting to group by columns.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be updated to correctly handle the grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Validate that the passed level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Handling grouping by column names when axis=1 is specified
    if axis == 1 and is_scalar(key) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]
        level = None
        
    # Create the BaseGrouper based on the grouping parameters
    grouper = BaseGrouper(
        group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)],
        sort=sort, 
        mutated=mutated
    )
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function ensures that when `axis=1` is specified for grouping by columns, it correctly handles the grouping based on the column names.

By making this change, the Keyerror issue reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
