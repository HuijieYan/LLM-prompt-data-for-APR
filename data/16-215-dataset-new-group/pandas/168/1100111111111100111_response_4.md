The issue arises with the `_get_grouper` function, causing a KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to group by column names.

The potential bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function's handling of the passed group name and axis.

The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of the group name and axis during the grouping operation. The function is not correctly recognizing the group name as a column label, leading to the KeyError. This results in the groupby operation not being able to group by columns as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the group name when grouping by columns using `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    ...
```

In this corrected version, if the specified axis is 1 and the key (group name) is found in the columns, it is transformed into the corresponding column data before proceeding with the rest of the grouping logic.

By making this change, the `_get_grouper` function will correctly handle the group name when grouping by columns, resolving the KeyError issue and allowing the groupby operation to work as expected.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and resolve the unexpected behavior when grouping by column names.
