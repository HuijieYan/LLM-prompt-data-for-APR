The buggy function seems to have an issue with processing the input and creating the BaseGrouper. Based on the provided runtime values, it's clear that the function fails to correctly identify the keys and match the axis length. This results in empty groupings and exclusions lists, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the keys are correctly identified and that the axis length is properly matched. Additionally, the function should handle the groupings and exclusions based on the input values provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = [key] if key is not None else []
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == group_axis.size

    # Create the groupings and exclusions based on keys and axis
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        groupings.append(Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, name=key, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True))
        exclusions.append(key)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the input values and create the BaseGrouper as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, allowing the function to correctly group the data along columns when `axis=1`.
