The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causes an issue with grouping along columns when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. The bug prevents the function from correctly handling the grouping by the column names.

The root cause of the bug is related to the processing of the `key` parameter when grouping along columns. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when attempting to group along columns by name.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the grouping along columns by name and ensure that the keys are processed properly when grouping along the specified axis.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # modifying the check to correctly handle grouping by columns
    if isinstance(key, str):
        if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
            key = [key]
        elif axis == 0 and key in obj.index:
            key = [key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in axis {axis}")

    # ... (existing code)

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function will correctly handle the `key` parameter when grouping along columns, and the `KeyError` should be resolved.

By implementing this fix, the function will be able to create the correct BaseGrouper for grouping along columns by name, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
