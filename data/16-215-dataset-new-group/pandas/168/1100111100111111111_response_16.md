## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and level in group_axis.names:
        level = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

    if isinstance(key, (str, list, tuple, np.ndarray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, (list, tuple, np.ndarray, Series)):
            keys = list(key)
        else:
            keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if all(isinstance(name, str) for name in keys):
            in_columns = all(name in obj.columns for name in keys)
            if in_columns:
                items = obj.filter(items=keys).columns
                new_key = items if len(items) > 1 else items[0]
                keys = [new_key]
                match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

```

This corrected version of the function includes updates to handle the grouping by columns in a DataFrame. It checks for the presence of the key in the dataframe's columns and reshapes the key to match the number of columns if necessary. This updated logic helps to address the issue with grouping along columns using the `groupby` function.
