The issue seems to arise from how level is handled when it is a list. The code treats it as a scalar value, which leads to unexpected behavior. This is especially evident when you are passing in a list of columns to group by, causing a ValueError. 

We need to correct the part of the function that deals with a list-like level. Instead of treating it as a scalar, it's more appropriate to iterate through the levels and create separate groupings for each combination of level and group. 

The corrected function should pass the failing test.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Process a list-like level
    if is_list_like(level):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for lev in level:
            key_lev = key if is_scalar(lev) else None
            if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
                key = (group_axis.get_level_values(lev) if is_scalar(lev) 
                       else (group_axis.get_level_values(l) for l in lev)
                      )
                level = None
            else:
                key = (group_axis if is_scalar(lev) else None)
                levels = lev if is_scalar(lev) else [None] * len(lev)

                for gpr, lv in zip(key, levels):
                    group_setup = setup_grouping(
                        obj,
                        gpr,
                        lv,
                        group_axis=group_axis,
                        obj=obj,
                        name=gpr,
                        level=lv,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                    )
                    groupings.append(group_setup[0])
                    exclusions.append(group_setup[1])
    else:
        # Existing single level validation code
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        # rest of the else block as is

    # Rest of the function can remain unchanged
    # ...<rest of the function>

```

The changes made involve a complete replacement of the section dealing with the level to handle multiple groupings when the level is list-like. This change should resolve the issues encountered in the failing tests.
