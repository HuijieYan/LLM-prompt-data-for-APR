Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The function seems to be failing to properly handle grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter.

The potential error locations within the function are:

1. The validation of the compatibility of the single level passed for grouping by columns.
2. The handling of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns.
3. The determination of the type of grouping being performed (e.g., index replacement or local references to axis and level).
4. The checks for matching axis length and other criteria for determining the nature of the grouping operation.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the grouping by column names when using `axis=1`. This leads to a KeyError being raised, as the function does not properly process the column names for grouping.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1` is specified. This may involve updating the logic for validating the compatibility of the single level, handling the `key` parameter for column grouping, and ensuring proper determination of the grouping type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Validation of the compatibility of the passed single level with the object's axis
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Grouping by column names when `axis=1`
    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        keys = key
    else:
        # Handling other cases for key and determining the grouping type
        # ...

    # ... (other logic for grouping)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of grouping by column names when `axis=1` is specified, ensuring that it processes the keys and axis appropriately for column-grouping operations.

Please note that the provided correction is a simplified version for demonstration and should be further tested and validated against the failing test and expected input/output values. Additional logic and error handling may be required based on the specifics of the bug and its context.
