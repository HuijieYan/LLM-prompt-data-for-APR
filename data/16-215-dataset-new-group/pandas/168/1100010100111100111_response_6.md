## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` has an issue with the handling of the `key` parameter when it is provided as a list of column names. This causes a KeyError when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function.

The relevant line causing the issue is:
```python
raise KeyError(gpr)
```

The key points that need to be addressed:
1. The function is not correctly handling the input `key` when it is a list of column names.
2. The function should be able to group by columns using a list of column names as the `key`.
3. The function should handle the case when the `key` is a list of column names and perform the groupby operation accordingly.

## Proposed Fix
1. Modify the logic in the function to correctly handle the `key` parameter when it is a list of column names.
2. Ensure that the function can perform the groupby operation using a list of column names as the `key`.

## Updated Corrected Version
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # If key is a list of column names, use it directly for grouping
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = [Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[key],
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True
        )]
    else:
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        # ... (other code remains the same)

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

With the above fix, the function should be able to correctly handle a list of column names provided as the `key` parameter and perform the groupby operation accordingly. This should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to perform a groupby operation using a list of column names.
