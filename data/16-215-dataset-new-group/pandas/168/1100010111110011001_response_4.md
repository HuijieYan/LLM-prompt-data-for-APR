```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py

def _get_grouper(
    # ... (other parameters remain unchanged)
):
    #Existing code

    # Replace the existing 'if' block with the following block
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
        else:
            level = [level] if is_list_like(level) else [level]
            key = group_axis

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

The issue arises when `level` is not None and there's an 'if' block inside the function that duplicates the code for different types of Index. We can refactor this 'if' block to handle both cases without duplicating the code.

By structuring the code better, we can avoid code duplication, making the function more readable and maintainable. This will also fix the bug related to `raise KeyError(gpr)`.
