To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to update the part of the code that handles grouping by column names. The code in question has an issue when attempting to identify whether a key corresponds to a column name or not.

Looking at the code and the failing test, it appears that the condition `elif is_in_axis(gpr)` and the subsequent `raise KeyError(gpr)` is causing the function to incorrectly identify the key `gpr` as not being in the object when it is a valid column name. This leads to the `KeyError` being raised.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle grouping by column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # In the future, a tuple key will always mean an actual key,
    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide
    # a warning. We can assume that the user wanted a list of keys when
    # the key is not in the index. We just have to be careful with
    # unhashable elements of `key`. Any unhashable elements implies that
    # they wanted a list of keys.
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18314
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (
            all_hashable and not all(k in obj for k in key)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            # Interpret tuple 'by' as a list of keys
            key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in obj for k in key):
        raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if keys are not found in the object

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that when grouping by column names, the function correctly identifies the keys as valid column names and does not raise a `KeyError`.

This correction will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, fixing the bug in the `_get_grouper` function.
