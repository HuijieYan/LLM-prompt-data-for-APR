### Bug Explanation
The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. In the provided runtime examples, the `key` parameter is expected to be a string or a list containing a string. However, the function implementation is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list.

When `key` is a list, the function does not correctly iterate through each element of the list to create the necessary Grouping objects for each key. Instead, it treats the entire list as a single key, leading to the KeyError. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
The function needs to be updated to handle the case when `key` is a list of keys. It should loop through each key in the list, creating the necessary Grouping objects for each key, and then combine them into a BaseGrouper. Additionally, the warnings for interpreting a tuple 'by' as a list of keys should also be modified to reflect the correct behavior when `key` is a list.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Fix the bug related to the 'key' parameter handling

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...
    
    # If key is a list, create Grouping for each key and combine into a BaseGrouper
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            g = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=k,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
            groupings.append(g)
            exclusions.append(k)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
        
    # existing code...
```

By updating the function to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list of keys, the bug related to grouping by column names should be resolved. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the function correctly interprets a list of keys.
