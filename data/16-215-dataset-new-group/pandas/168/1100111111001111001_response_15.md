# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,

    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,

    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    # Snippet of the original code that needed correction
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis) # Object does not have an _get_axis attribute
    if axis == 0:
        group_axis = obj.columns
    else:
        group_axis = obj.index

    # ... Rest of the code

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The bug in the original function is with the access to the `_get_axis` attribute of the `obj`, which is incorrect. Instead, the correct way to access the required axis is by checking the value of the `axis` parameter and assigning `group_axis` accordingly based on values of 0 or 1.
