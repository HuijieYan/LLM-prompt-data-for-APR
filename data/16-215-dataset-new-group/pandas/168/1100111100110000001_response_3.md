There are some issues with the `_get_grouper` function that are causing the test cases to fail. The function is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It is also composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers. The function for determining the grouping attempts to define and create a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

The error occurs when passing in a list of group keys, causing key errors in the function. Specifically, the function is not handling the case when `key` is a list of keys correctly. The implementation of the function is limiting the compatibility to only work with a simple key when it comes to validating, checking for key/level overlaps and determining the local references to axis, level, and sort. 

Given this analysis, a strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the function to handle the case when `key` is a list of keys properly. It should iterate through each key in the list and perform the necessary validations and checks for key/level overlaps. It should also create the Grouping for each key and then combine them into a BaseGrouper.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    levels = level if isinstance(level, list) else [level] * len(keys

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)
            col = obj[gpr.name]
        elif is_in_axis(gpr):  # df.groupby('name')
            if gpr in obj:
                if validate:
                    obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
                in_axis, name, col = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
                exclusions.append(name)
            elif obj._is_level_reference(gpr):
                in_axis, name, level, col = False, gpr, level, None
            else:
                raise KeyError(gpr)
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        grouping = Grouping(
            group_axis, col, obj=obj, name=name, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=in_axis
        )
        groupings.append(grouping)
            
    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected function now correctly handles the case when `key` is a list of keys. It iterates through each key and performs the necessary validations and checks while creating the groupings associated with them. This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases.
