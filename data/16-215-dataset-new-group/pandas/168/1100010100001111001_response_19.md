The bug in the function `_get_grouper` seems to be related to the conditional logic within the function that produces incorrect results when level is a list. The function should create a Match axis length for each key.

Potential Location of Error:
1. The conditional logic inside the function `_get_grouper`.

Bug Explanation:
Looking at the data provided for the function and the expected results, it seems that the groupings variable is not getting the expected list of Grouping objects for the test cases, which leads to a mismatch of the expected and actual outputs for the function's return. This mismatch suggests a problem with the conditional logic dealing with levels as a list in the function.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Refactor the conditional logic dealing with levels when it is a list in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
                
        if is_categorical_dtype(group_axis) and len(group_axis) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                "Length of grouper and axis must be same length"
            )
            
    for key in keys:
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)
            
    keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
    groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, gpr, name=None, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed) for gpr in keys]
            
    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    else:
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        
    return grouper, [], obj
```

The corrected function makes it clear that the function expects a single level or a list of levels, and if the length of the grouper and axis are not the same, it raises a ValueError, in line with the expected behavior of the function based on the provided data.
