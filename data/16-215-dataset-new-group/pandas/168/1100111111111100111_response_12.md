## Bug Fixes

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list of strings. The fix involves updating the code to handle the case when `is_tuple` is `False` and `is_list_like` is `True`, and to ensure that the input `key` is treated as a list of keys when the condition is met.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    # In the future, a tuple key will always mean an actual key,
    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide
    # a warning. We can assume that the user wanted a list of keys when
    # the key is not in the index. We just have to be careful with
    # unhashable elements of `key`. Any unhashable elements implies that
    # they wanted a list of keys.
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18314
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (
            all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            # column names ('a', 'b') -> ['a', 'b']
            # arrays like (a, b) -> [a, b]
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        if (
            all(isinstance(k, str) and k in obj for k in key)
        ):
            key = list(key)

    # Existing code

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function will correctly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list of strings, ensuring that it is treated as a list of keys for grouping.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
