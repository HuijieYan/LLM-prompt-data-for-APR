# The bug causes the `_get_grouper` function to fail to group dataframes by columns when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError even though the intention is to group by column labels.

The issue is related to the `is_hashable` function and the logic involved to interpret a tuple 'by' as a list of keys rather than a single key. The code is not able to correctly interpret the input and convert it to the expected behavior.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to re-evaluate the logic around interpreting the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function when it receives a list of keys and the `axis=1` parameter. It could involve re-writing the logic to handle the grouping by columns more accurately and ensure that the function correctly understands the input provided in the `by` parameter.

The corrected version of the function might involve re-writing the logic to handle the grouping of columns accurately when the `axis=1` parameter is used. This corrected logic should ensure that the function correctly interprets the input provided in the `by` parameter, whether it's a single key or a list of keys.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code

    if isinstance(key, list) and axis == 1:
        if all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
            key = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) for k in key]
            
    # existing code
```

The corrected code involves adding a specific handling for when the `axis` parameter is 1 and the `key` parameter is a list of strings. It converts the list of column names to a list of column indices and uses this information for grouping.

This fixed code takes into account the failure to create the groupings when the `axis=1` parameter was used, and addresses the issue by correctly handling the list of column names passed as the `key` parameter.
