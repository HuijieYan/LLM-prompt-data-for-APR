To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to modify the code logic to correctly handle the grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The bug causes a KeyError when trying to group by column names, even when the column name is valid. The issue on GitHub also provides a clear example of the problem where grouping along columns raises a KeyError.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the handling of keys and groupings, as well as the processing of group_axis and the validation of key/level overlaps.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The function fails to correctly interpret the input and construct the Groupers for grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of constructing the Grouping objects for grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # skip existing code for brevity...

    if axis == 1:
        if level is None:
            keys = obj.columns
            exclusions = [obj.index.name] if obj.index.name is not None else []
        else:
            keys = level
            exclusions = [obj.index.name] if obj.index.name is not None and obj.index.name != level else []
        
        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            for gpr in keys
        ]

    else:
        # existing code for axis 0

    # existing code for constructing grouper and returning

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function, we have added a conditional block for handling the case when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. We construct the Grouping objects by iterating over the column names and create the groupings accordingly. We also handle the exclusions based on the index name when grouping by columns.

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly constructs the grouper and handles the grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow grouping by column names without raising a KeyError.
