Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `groupby` method not working correctly when trying to group by column names using the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError being raised, even though the intention is to group by columns. The expected output is a dataframe with the index [0, 1, 0] but grouped and summed columns [10, 20].

### Bug Cause Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to handle the case when `key` is a single string or a list of strings representing column names while grouping along the columns (axis=1). This leads to a KeyError being raised when attempting to group by column names using `axis=1`.

The problem seems to be related to the procedure to create the groupings and exclusions within the function, and how it handles the `key` parameter for column-wise grouping.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should properly process the provided column names and create the necessary groupings and exclusions for column-wise grouping (axis=1). It should handle the case when `key` represents one or more column names to be used for grouping along the columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # ... (existing function code here)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]  # Convert single string key to a list of keys for column-wise grouping

    # ... (remaining code for other cases and conditions)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Fix Description
In the corrected version, we have added a conditional check to convert a single string `key` to a list of keys when grouping along the columns (axis=1). This ensures that the function properly handles the situation when a single column name is provided for column-wise grouping.

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the case when grouping by column names using `axis=1` and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

With this fix, the `groupby` method should work as expected for grouping along the columns, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

After making this modification, the fix should be tested with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is resolved and the `groupby` method produces the expected output.
