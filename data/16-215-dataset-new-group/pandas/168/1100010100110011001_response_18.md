```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Other code unchanged as it is not related to the failing test

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key] if key is not None else []
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
The issue appears to be with the initialization of the `keys` variable. We should initialize a list with `key` only if it is not `None`. Then we set `match_axis_length` based on the length of `keys` compared to the length of `group_axis`. The rest of the code remains the same. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
