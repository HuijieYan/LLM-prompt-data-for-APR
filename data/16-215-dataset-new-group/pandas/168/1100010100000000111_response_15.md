The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is related to the issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" posted on GitHub. The issue describes the problem where using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` raises a KeyError, even though "x" is a column name and it is expected to group by the columns.

The cause of the bug in the function `_get_grouper` is that it does not handle the grouping by column names correctly, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions when attempting to group along columns.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` should be revised to correctly handle the grouping by column names when the `axis=1` argument is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    ... (function description remains the same)
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key == group_axis.name and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        key = None

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if axis == 0 and obj.columns.name != key:
            raise KeyError(f"Column name '{key}' is not the name of the columns")
        elif axis == 1 and obj.index.name != key:
            raise KeyError(f"Index name '{key}' is not the name of the index")

    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `key` is equal to the `group_axis.name`, and if so, set `key` to `None`, and then we added conditional checks to handle the cases when `key` is a string representing a column name. These checks ensure that the key is valid for grouping along columns (`axis=1`) or rows (`axis=0`) and raises the appropriate KeyError if the key is not found.

With these changes, the function `_get_grouper` should now correctly handle grouping by column names when using `axis=1`, resolving the issue described on GitHub.
