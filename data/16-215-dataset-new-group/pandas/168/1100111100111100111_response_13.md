## Bug
The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter is a string or a list of strings indicating column names for grouping along the columns when using `groupby(axis=1)`.

## Reason for the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_get_grouper` function does not correctly handle the scenario where the `key` parameter is a string or list of strings indicating the column names for grouping when using `axis=1`. The function incorrectly processes these strings as if they were meant to be used for the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter indicates column names for grouping along the columns when using `axis=1`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    # mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    # This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    # multiple groupers

    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

```

The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function includes a modification to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a string when using `axis=1`. This modification ensures that a single string `key` is converted into a list of keys for correct processing when grouping along the columns.

The `if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple))` condition checks if the `axis` is 1, the `key` is not None, and the `key` is not already a list or tuple. If these conditions are met, the `key` is converted into a list of keys for further processing.

This modification ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the `key` parameter indicates column names for grouping along the columns when using `axis=1`.
