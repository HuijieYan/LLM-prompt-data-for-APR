The bug in the `_get_grouper` function causes a `KeyError`. This error occurs when the `group_name` parameter is a list, which is not properly handled in the function.

The bug is likely to be in the logic handling the `group_name` parameter, which seems to be assuming that the `group_name` is a single string and not handling the case where it is a list.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle both single strings and lists as the `group_name` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Enhancement to handle list-like group_name parameter
    if is_list_like(key):
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    # ... (remaining code or code below)

```
In this corrected version, we added a check to handle the case when `key` is a list. If `key` is a list with one element, we set `key` to that element. If `key` is a list with multiple elements, we retain the existing logic under the `else` statement to handle it appropriately.

This change allows the function to handle both single strings and lists as the `group_name` parameter, fixing the bug.

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly handle the `group_name` parameter and pass the failing test.
