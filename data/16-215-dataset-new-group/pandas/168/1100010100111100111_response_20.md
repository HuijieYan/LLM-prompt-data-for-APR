## Bug Explanation:

The bug appears to be related to the behavior of the `groupby` function when using the `axis` parameter with a value of `1`. When grouping along the columns axis, the function should accept column names as the `by` parameter. However, the function raises a `KeyError` when the `by` parameter is a column name.

In the provided code, the `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` call is expected to group the dataframe `df` along the columns using the column name "x". However, this results in a `KeyError` being raised.

The bug occurs due to a check in the `_get_grouper` function within the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The function attempts to process the provided `by` parameter, but there seems to be a discrepancy in the processing logic for grouping along the columns axis.

## Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, the processing logic in the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where the `by` parameter is a column name and the `axis` parameter is set to `1`. The function should identify the column name correctly and create the grouping accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... [existing code]

    if level is not None and axis == 1:
        # Process the 'by' parameter for grouping along columns axis
        if key is None and isinstance(level, str):
            key = level  # Set the key to the column name

    # ... [remaining code]
```

By making this change, the `_get_grouper` function should correctly handle the groupby operation using the column name when `axis` is set to `1`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the `groupby` function to group along the columns axis using the column names as expected.

It's important to test the modified function with different use cases to ensure that the fix works correctly in all scenarios. Once confirmed, the updated `grouper.py` file can be submitted for review and inclusion in the next release of Pandas.
