The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be that it raises a `KeyError` when the `key` parameter is a list of length 1, but it should be treated similar to a single key parameter in the subsequent logic.

The `key` parameter should be checked for being a list, and if it is a list of length 1, it should be converted to a single key to avoid the subsequent logic raising a `KeyError`.

Based on the analysis presented and the failing tests, here's a statement of what the corrected function should look like:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    (docstring remains the same)
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # check if key is a list of length 1
        key = key[0]  # convert single item list to single item
    
    # rest of the function body remains the same
    # ...
```

The correction involves checking the `key` parameter for a list of length 1 and then converting it to a single key before proceeding to the remainder of the logic in the function.

This correction should address the issues faced in the failing tests.
