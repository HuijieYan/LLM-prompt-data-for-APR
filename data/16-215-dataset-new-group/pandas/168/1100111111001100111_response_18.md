The bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be related to how the function handles grouping by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. It seems that the function fails to properly handle the grouping by columns, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions when attempting to group by column names.

The issue seems to stem from the detection and processing of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. The function should properly interpret the passed column names and create the necessary Grouping objects for each column. Additionally, it needs to handle the case where multiple column names are passed for grouping.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to correctly process the passed column names and create the required Grouping objects for grouping by columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if key is None:
        keys = group_axis
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the passed column names for grouping and creates the necessary Grouping objects. It should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test for grouping by columns.
