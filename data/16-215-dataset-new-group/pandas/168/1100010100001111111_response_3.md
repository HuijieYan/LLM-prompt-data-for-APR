## Bug Explanation
The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when calling the `_get_grouper` function with a DataFrame and `axis=1` (grouping along columns). The function is not correctly interpreting the `key` as a column name for grouping along columns, leading to unexpected behavior and KeyError.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, the issue seems to stem from the way the `key` is processed when `axis=1`. The `keys` are not being correctly identified as column names for grouping along columns, leading to the failure to group along the specified columns as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the handling of the `key` parameter and the identification of column names for grouping along columns needs to be revised. It's important to ensure that the function correctly interprets and processes the `key` as column names when `axis=1`. Additionally, the handling of `keys` and `group_axis` need to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior of grouping along columns.

## The Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below. The changes primarily focus on properly interpreting the `key` parameter when `axis=1` to ensure correct grouping along columns.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # (Add necessary import statements, comments, and function description)

    # Check if grouping along columns
    if axis == 1:
        key = ensure_categorical(key)
        indexer = obj.columns.get_indexer_for([key])
        
        # Check if column indexer found
        if -1 in indexer:
            raise KeyError(f"Column name '{key}' not found in DataFrame columns")
        
        # Create BaseGrouper for grouping along columns
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, indexer, names=[key], axis=1, sort=sort)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:
        # Handle grouping along index or other cases
        # ... (existing logic remains unchanged)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By adding the above checks and adjustments to the `_get_grouper` function, we ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly interpreted for grouping along columns, thus addressing the bug and aligning the behavior with the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected grouping behavior when using `axis=1`.
