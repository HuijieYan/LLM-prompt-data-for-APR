The bug stems from the `_get_grouper` function, particularly the section of code responsible for handling the 'MultiIndex' instance, which is causing unexpected behavior when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter.

The bug seems to be causing issues related to the grouping of columns, especially when using the `axis=1` parameter, which is failing to correctly group by the specified column or list of columns.

To address the bug, it's essential to review the logic in the `_get_grouper` function, especially where it handles the 'MultiIndex' instance and the grouping of columns. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the specified column or list of columns when using `groupby` with `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Process groupby on specified column or list of columns
    elif axis == 1 and is_list_like(key) and key in obj.columns:
        return BaseGrouper(obj[key], [], axis=1), [], obj

    # In all other cases, return the original obj
    return obj, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the function includes an additional conditional block specifically for handling the grouping of columns when `axis=1` and a list-like key is provided. This block ensures that the function correctly identifies the specified columns and processes the grouping as expected.

With this correction, the function should handle the grouping of columns as intended, allowing the `groupby` method to correctly group by the specified columns when using the `axis=1` parameter.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug by addressing the unexpected behavior when attempting to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter.
