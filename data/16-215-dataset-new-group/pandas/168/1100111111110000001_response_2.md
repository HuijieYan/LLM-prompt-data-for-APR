The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError. The error is likely being caused by incorrect handling of the `group_name` parameter which needs to be used as the `key` in `_get_grouper` function. This bug could be causing an incorrect grouping of the DataFrame which leads to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function should be revised. The `group_name` parameter should be used as the `key` in the `_get_grouper` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    if key is None:
        key = group_name  # Use group_name as key

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
    # ...
```

With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function will use the `group_name` as the `key` parameter when performing the grouping operation.

Once this fix is applied, the failing test should pass without raising a KeyError.
