The code provided contains many external functions and classes that are not in the code snippet. Without a full context, it's not feasible to understand the complete logic. However, based on the defined use of variables, it's possible to identify a potential cause of the error. 

The variable `group_axis` is being set to `obj._get_axis(axis)`. Logically, it appears that there could be a problem with this value when the axis is set to 1, as in the failing test cases.

Based on the error message, it seems that the function is trying to find a key `'x'` in an index, but it is raising a `KeyError` exception because it can't find it. The issue might be related to applying the `groupby` operation on a DataFrame using `axis=1`. 

Given this analysis, a potential fix could be to review the computation of `group_axis` within the `_get_grouper` function in relation to the provided DataFrame, and possibly consider adjusting the method of identifying the key based on the column index. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Existing imports are retained
import warnings

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Logic for obtaining group_axis along with handling of the key

    if axis == 0:
        group_axis = obj.columns
    else:
        group_axis = obj.index

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

Please note that additional adjustments may be required, but without the related utilities, a comprehensive fix is not feasible.
