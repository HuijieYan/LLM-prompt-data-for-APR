The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing unexpected behavior when grouping by columns. The `is_tuple` variable is being incorrectly set to `False` even when the `key` parameter is a list. This leads to incorrect processing of the `key` variable, resulting in the KeyError being raised when trying to group by columns.

To fix the bug, the `is_tuple` variable needs to be properly set based on the type of the `key` parameter. Additionally, the code for processing the `key` variable needs to be adjusted to account for both single keys and lists of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # determine if the key is a tuple
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)

    if not is_tuple:
        if not isinstance(key, list):  # Ensure key is a list
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
    else:
        keys = list(key)

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == obj.shape[axis]

    # rest of the function remains the same

    # ... (existing code)
```

By correcting the way the `is_tuple` variable is set and adjusting the processing of the `key` variable, the function will be able to properly handle both single keys and lists of keys for grouping on columns.

This fix should address the reported issue on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for grouping by columns in the `groupby()` function.
