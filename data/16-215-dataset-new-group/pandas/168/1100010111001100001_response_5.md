There is a bug in the `_get_grouper` function that is causing the test cases to fail. The issue appears to be related to how the `level` variable is used and modified within the function. The `_get_grouper` function is encountering errors in processing the `level` and `key` parameters for a MultiIndex instance. The `level` should be assigned to None and the `key` should be assigned to the group_axis, but this process is not being executed properly for a MultiIndex instance.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic that handles the `level` and `key` parameters specific to the MultiIndex instance. This will correct how the `level` and `key` are processed and assigned in the subsequent steps of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, l) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        level = l  # Assign level to l within the loop

        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the `level` variable is properly assigned within the loop to handle MultiIndex instances, and the `key` variable is also processed correctly to enable proper assignment to `groupings`.

By making these adjustments, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle MultiIndex instances correctly and pass the failing test cases.
