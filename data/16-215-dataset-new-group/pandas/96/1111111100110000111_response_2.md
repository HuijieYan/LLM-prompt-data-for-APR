## Analysis
The buggy function is `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function is called by `pd.date_range()` method and is causing the following error: "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH".

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect logic for adjusting business hours and days.
2. Incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `apply` function when adjusting business hours and days. The function is not handling holidays correctly, which leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated in `pd.date_range()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure accurate handling of business hours and days adjustments.
2. Update the code to correctly handle the holidays and adjust the periods accordingly.

### Bug Fix
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Added the missing class method
def _validate_frequency(cls, index, freq, **kwargs):
    inferred = index.inferred_freq
    if index.size == 0 or inferred == freq.freqstr:
        return None

    on_freq = cls._generate_range(
        start=index[0], end=None, periods=len(index), freq=freq, **kwargs
    )
    if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
        raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}")

# Updated the class
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other methods and functions)

    # Updated the decorator
    @classmethod
    def apply(cls, other):
        def decorator(func):
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                cls._validate_frequency(other, cls, **kwargs)
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
        return decorator

    # ... (other methods and functions)
```

This corrected version includes a modified `apply` method and the addition of the missing class method `_validate_frequency`. The `_validate_frequency` method is added for frequency validation and handles the inferred frequency for business hours. Additionally, the decorator `apply` has been updated to properly handle the frequency validation.
