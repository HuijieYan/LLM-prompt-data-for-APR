The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is intended to modify a datetime object based on the business hours defined by the instance of the class. The function is designed to handle edge cases such as adjustments for positive or negative business days, remaining business hours to adjust, and non-fixed frequencies. The error message is related to inconsistencies in inferred frequencies from passed values and does not conform to the passed frequency.

Upon reviewing the code and the provided runtime input/output values, two potential causes of the bug have been identified:

1. The adjustments for positive and negative business days and remaining business hours seem to be incorrect in some cases, leading to inconsistencies in the inferred frequency.
2. There may be issues with the condition checks and adjustments within the while loops.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to modify the conditions for the adjustments and ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are appropriately handled. Additionally, the condition checks and adjustments within the while loops need to be reviewed for accuracy.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # No changes to timezone and nanosecond
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            on_offset = self._is_on_offset(other)
            if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not on_offset):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if on_offset:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                hours_to_add = skip_bd + remain if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else skip_bd
                other = prev_open + hours_to_add
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these changes, the `apply` function should now handle adjustments for business days and remaining business hours accurately and provide the expected behavior, passing the failing test cases.
