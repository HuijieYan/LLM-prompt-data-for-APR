The buggy function `apply` has several issues related to business hours calculation when using custom holidays, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The issue arises due to incorrect logic for handling business hours in the presence of holidays, which leads to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for adjusting business hours and handling custom holidays in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # Fix for the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = as_datetime(other)

            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted = self._adjust_business_hours(other)
            else:
                adjusted = self._adjust_business_hours(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _adjust_business_hours(self, current_time):
        if not self._is_holiday(current_time):
            return current_time

        adjusted_time = current_time
        one_bh = self._get_business_hour_duration()
        while self._is_holiday(adjusted_time):
            adjusted_time += one_bh

        return adjusted_time

    def _is_holiday(self, dt):
        return dt in self.holidays
```

In the corrected version, the function `_adjust_business_hours` is added to handle the adjustment of business hours in the presence of holidays. It checks if the current time is a holiday, and if so, it adjusts the time to the next valid business hour. The function `_is_holiday` is used to check if a given datetime is a holiday.

With these changes, the `apply` function should now handle custom holidays correctly and produce the expected results.

These modifications address the issue reported on GitHub and provide an improved logic for adjusting business hours in the presence of holidays.
