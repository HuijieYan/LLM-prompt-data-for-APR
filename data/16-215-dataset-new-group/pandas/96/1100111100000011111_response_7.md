The buggy function seems to be the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function takes an input `other` which is expected to be a `datetime` object. The function is supposed to perform a series of business hour manipulations to `other` based on the defined business hours and holidays. However, the function has a bug that seems to cause it to produce unexpected outputs when handling holidays.

The potential error locations within the buggy function can be identified in the sections where the business day adjustments are made based on the holidays. The usage of `self.next_bday` instead of `self.next_bday()` and the calculations involving `bhour_remain` and the adjustment loops are potential areas to investigate further.

The cause of the bug might be related to the incorrect use of `self.next_bday` without the function call. This might lead to incorrect business day adjustments and, in turn, produce unexpected results when calculating the adjusted datetime.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve adding missing function calls where necessary and reviewing the logic for handling holidays and business day adjustments.

Below is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# ... (other code remains unchanged)

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):                
        # Use 'self.next_bday()' instead of 'self.next_bday'
        if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            # adjust other based on holidays
            # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making this change, the `next_bday` function is called correctly, and the adjustments based on holidays and business days are handled accurately. This should address the bug and lead to the correct behavior of the `apply` function.
