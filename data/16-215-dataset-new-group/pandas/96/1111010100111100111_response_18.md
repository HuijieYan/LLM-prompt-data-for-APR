Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
- The issue is occurring when adding holidays to the custom business hour frequency.
- The bug is causing the `date_range` function to produce more periods than specified, which is inconsistent behavior.
- The function is intended to adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle, based on the business hour frequency and provided holidays.
- The bug could be related to the adjustments being made to the input datetime based on the provided holidays, or incorrect handling of the weekdays and holiday adjustments.

To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime, and the handling of weekdays and holidays is correctly implemented inside the `apply` function. Verify that the adjustments are consistent with the expected behavior of a custom business hour frequency when holidays are provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            if n > 0:
                other += pd.Timedelta(days=1)
                n -= 1
            elif n < 0:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(days=1)
                n += 1

        # Adjust for the custom business hour frequency
        while n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n -= 1
        while n < 0:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on properly handling the adjustments for holidays and the custom business hour frequency, ensuring that the input datetime is correctly adjusted within the specified frequency, taking into account the provided holidays.

By applying these changes, the bug should be resolved, and the `date_range` function should work as expected when holidays are provided with a custom business hour frequency.
