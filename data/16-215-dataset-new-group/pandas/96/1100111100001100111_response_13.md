The issue reported on GitHub pertains to the abnormal behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. In particular, the user reported that when adding holidays, the function produces more than the specified number of periods, leading to unexpected results.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue stems from the behavior of the `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` functions, which are called within the buggy `apply` function. These functions are used to adjust the datetime based on business hours, but the adjustments are leading to incorrect results, particularly when holidays are involved.

The buggy function is adding extra periods because the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, holidays, and business days is flawed. The calculation of the number of business days, remaining business hours, and the adjustment of the datetime in different scenarios is leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the strategy involves carefully examining the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, holidays, and business days. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the adjustments are correctly handled to produce the expected number of periods in the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = datetime.combine(other, self.start[0])
        end_time = datetime.combine(other, self.end[0])

        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_time = max(start_time, other)
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(hours=1)
                if adjusted_time.weekday() < 5 and adjusted_time not in self.holidays:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            adjusted_time = min(end_time, other)
            while n < 0:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if adjusted_time.weekday() < 5 and adjusted_time not in self.holidays:
                    n += 1

        return adjusted_time

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime is simplified and improved. The adjusted time is calculated directly based on the start and end times of business hours, taking into account the specified number of periods.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and produce the expected number of periods when using the `pd.date_range` function with holidays and business hours.
