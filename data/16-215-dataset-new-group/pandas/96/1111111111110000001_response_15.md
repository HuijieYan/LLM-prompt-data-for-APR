There seem to be many functions and classes involved in this case. The main buggy function is `apply()` which is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin`. This function is calling other functions and classes, such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and several others, which are not provided in the code snippet. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` which is testing the behavior of the `apply()` function when creating a date range with custom holidays.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to the frequency not conforming to the passed values. This points towards an issue with the way the custom business hour offset is applied when creating the date range.

The buggy function `apply()` looks complex and hard to reason about due to the use of several functions, conditional statements, and manipulation of datetime objects. 

To fix this bug, it's important to carefully review the logic inside the `apply()` function and the related functions to ensure they are correctly adjusting the dates based on the custom business hours and holidays. It may require validating the frequency and ensuring that the adjustments do not conflict with the provided custom business hours and holidays.

It's also advisable to add detailed comments explaining the logic of the `apply()` function and its interaction with the related functions for better understanding and maintainability.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
# corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # return the input if it already satisfies the business hours
        if self.is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        adjusted = self._next_opening_time(other)  # get the next opening time
        while not self.is_on_offset(adjusted):      # loop until the adjusted time is on offset
            adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted)

        return adjusted  # return the adjusted time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction simplifies the logic and ensures that the adjusted datetime is on offset with the custom business hours. However, since the related functions and classes are not provided, the exact implementation might vary based on the details of those functions and classes.
