The buggy function is taking a date-time object and returning a modified date-time object based on certain offset conditions. It requires clear datetime, nanosecond, and n values to execute properly. The buggy function also uses functions and attributes from other functions and classes that are being imported but not defined here, which makes it challenging to fully assess the code.

The error message suggests a possible problem in validating a frequency. Since the function integrates multiple functions and classes, error messages and test cases, it is hard to pinpoint, in detail, the particular line causing the error.

A good strategy to fix this could include:
1. Ensuring that the imported functions and classes have been properly implemented and defined elsewhere.
2. Verifying that the imported functions and classes are yielding the correct output.
3. Tracing and debugging the time-manipulation logic within the buggy function to identify points of possible failure.

Given these guidelines, we can refactor the buggy function as per the provided test cases and expected outcomes. However, the original function's interaction with other elements of the program may need to be resolved separately. Additionally, the correct implementation of the referenced custom classes and functions will be required.

Here is a possible corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    return other
```
Since the customized classes and functions are not fully available, this implementation may not suffice. To make it functional, all dependencies need to work as expected. Also, for the complete solution to the error message, the interaction between the buggy function and related classes should be reviewed.
