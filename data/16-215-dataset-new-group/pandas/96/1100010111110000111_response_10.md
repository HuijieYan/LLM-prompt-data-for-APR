The issue lies in the logic of the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The issue seems to be that when adding holidays to a CustomBusinessHour frequency, the `apply` function is not calculating the correct number of periods.

The test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` fails due to this bug. The test is trying to create a date range with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and custom holidays, but the output does not match the expected result.

The error message describes a ValueError being raised during the call to `pd.DatetimeIndex()`, indicating that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem is related to the behavior of `pd.date_range()` when using periods and adding holidays.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `apply` function to correctly handle holiday periods and align the date range generation with custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.onOffset(other) or other.hour < self.hour:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        next_business_hour = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessHour(n=bd)
            other = skip_bd._apply_business_day_shift(other)

        # calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        other = self._apply_remaining_business_hours(other, r, next_business_hour, n, businesshours)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this fixed version of the `apply` function, the custom business hours and holidays should be correctly handled, and the date range creation with periods and holidays is expected to work properly.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to adding holidays to a CustomBusinessHour frequency in `pd.date_range()`.
