The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function does not handle the holidays properly when the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is used in the `pd.date_range` function. As a result, the output produces more periods than expected, as described in the GitHub issue.

The buggy function appears to improperly calculate the number of periods when holidays are involved. It leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the output.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function must be modified to correctly handle the holidays when adjusting the period count based on business days and hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions in the class)

    # Modify the buggy function to fix the holiday handling
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (remaining code is similar)

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # (remaining code is similar)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This modified version of the `apply` function includes checks for holidays when adjusting the input datetime. It ensures that holidays are properly handled and does not impact the calculation of periods.

By making these changes, the corrected `apply` function should now handle the holidays correctly when used with the `pd.date_range` function, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
