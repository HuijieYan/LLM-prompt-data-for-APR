The bug in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is likely causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to raise a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method, leading to the failure of the test.

The bug appears to be related to the calculation of business days and hours during the adjustment of the `other` datetime object. The calculation of business days and hours, as well as the adjustment logic, seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior in some cases.

The cause of the bug can be identified as the incorrect adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours and days. This misadjustment results in invalid frequencies for the returned datetime indices, leading to the `ValueError`.

A strategy to fix the bug could involve revisiting the logic for adjusting business days and hours, ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly, and the returned datetime indices have valid frequencies.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n == 0:
                return other
            
            # If n > 0, adjust to the next opening time or next business day's opening time
            if self.n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:  # If n < 0
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Calculate business hours in a day
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            # Calculate business days and remaining hours
            business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(self.n) * business_hours, 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_business_days = CustomBusinessDay(n=business_days)
                other = other + skip_business_days
    
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            td = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds * 60)
            if self.n >= 0:
                other += td
            else:
                last_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if td <= last_closing_time - other:
                    other += td
                else:
                    remaining_td = td - (last_closing_time - other)
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + td)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time + remaining_td)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this revised version of the `apply` method, the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days has been reassessed to ensure correct adjustments and valid frequencies for the returned datetime indices.
