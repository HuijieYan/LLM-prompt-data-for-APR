The base issue in the buggy function is that it fails to appropriately apply the business hours to the given datetime. The function should account for business days, adjust to the next opening time, and calculate the remaining business hours.

To address the issue, I recommend revising the code to address each of these problems. Specifically, ensure that business days are adjusted correctly, adjust to the next opening time when necessary, and calculate the remaining business hours in each case.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
import datetime
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessDay:
    pass  # Replace with actual BusinessDay class if available

# corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self.end[x] - self.start[x] for x in range(len(self.end)))
        
        # use replace to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)  # replace with actual class if available
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = datetime.timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != datetime.timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = datetime.timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != datetime.timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = datetime.timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should address the bug and handle the expected inputs and outputs while accommodating the provided timestamp and incorporating the business hours. This function should now satisfy the requirements presented in the expected cases.
