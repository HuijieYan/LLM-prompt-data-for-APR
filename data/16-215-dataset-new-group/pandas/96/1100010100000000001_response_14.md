The buggy function is performing business hour arithmetic on datetime objects. The potential error locations within the function could be related to the business hour arithmetic, adjustment of business days, and handling of remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug in the function is likely related to the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours. The conditions and calculations may not be correctly handling all edge cases, leading to incorrect results.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to thoroughly review and test the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours in different scenarios to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ApplyTypeError(Exception):
    pass

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if self.n >= 0:
            # adjust for next opening time
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
        else:
            # adjust for previous closing time
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1) if other.time() in self.start else other
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # logic for adjusting business days
        if self.n != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=self.n)

        # get adjusted total business hours
        business_hours = sum([((e - s).seconds / 60) for s, e in zip(self.start, self.end)])

        mins_to_adjust = self.n * business_hours

        # adjust the business hours
        while mins_to_adjust != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour.seconds / 60 >= mins_to_adjust:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=mins_to_adjust)
                    mins_to_adjust = 0
                else:
                    mins_to_adjust -= bhour.seconds / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour.seconds / 60 <= mins_to_adjust:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=mins_to_adjust)
                    mins_to_adjust = 0
                else:
                    mins_to_adjust += bhour.seconds / 60
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment for business days and business hours has been simplified to handle positive and negative adjustments separately. The total business hours are calculated and used to adjust the datetime object accordingly. The while loops have been restructured to accurately adjust the remaining business hours. Additionally, error handling for non-datetime objects has been improved.
