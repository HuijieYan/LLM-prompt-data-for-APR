## The identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The adjustment of the `other` variable to reduce the number of cases to handle might be causing the unexpected behavior.
2. The calculation of business days and remaining business hours may not be accurately adjusting the `other` variable as intended.
3. The while loops to adjust the remaining business hours in each business time interval may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect output.

## The cause of the bug:
The bug is causing the CustomBusinessHour function to produce more periods than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue. The bug is likely due to incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable and miscalculation of business days and remaining business hours within the function. This causes the date_range to create more periods than intended when using the CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the adjustment of the `other` variable to ensure it accurately aligns with the desired business hours.
2. Ensure that the calculation of business days and remaining business hours is correctly adjusting the `other` variable for holidays and non-business hours.
3. Test each section of the function separately to identify specific areas where the unexpected behavior is occurring and make targeted fixes.
4. Consider using sample input cases to verify the behavior of the buggy function, comparing the output with the expected values.

```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified potential error locations and includes adjustments to accurately handle business days, remaining business hours, and adjustments in business hours intervals. We would need to test this corrected function with the input cases to ensure it produces the expected outputs as described in the GitHub issue and the expected test cases.
