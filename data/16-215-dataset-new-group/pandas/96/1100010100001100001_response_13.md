The buggy function uses the check isinstance(other, datetime) to detect if the input is a datetime object, however it's not correctly handling pandas Timestamp objects, causing the function to raise an ApplyTypeError. The function is also trying to reset the timezone and nanosecond in a Timestamp using vanilla datetime, which is not a correct conversion for handling Timestamps.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the Timestamp objects correctly and use pandas Timedelta for time difference calculations instead of datetime.timedelta. We should also check the nanosecond attribute of the Timestamp using getattr.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        n = self.n
        start_timestamp = pd.Timestamp(other)
        
        # Comparison of time is directly possible with a Timestamp
        if n >= 0:
            if start_timestamp.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(start_timestamp):
                other = self._next_opening_time(start_timestamp)
        else:
            if start_timestamp.time() <= self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(start_timestamp):
                other = self._next_opening_time(start_timestamp)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)

        else:

                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
