## Bug Cause
The buggy function is failing to handle the adjustments needed for CustomBusinessHour objects when combining with datetime objects. The adjustment logic is incorrect and causing the failing test cases.

## Bug Location
The logic for adjusting the business hours and handling business days seems to be causing the bug.

## Fix Strategy
The adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours needs to be improved. Additionally, the logic for handling CustomBusinessHour objects needs to be checked.

## Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end))

                n = self.n
                total_seconds = n * businesshours
                total_hours, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(total_seconds) // 60, 60)

                if n >= 0:
                    # Handle forward adjustments
                    while total_hours > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        total_hours -= 1

                else:
                    # Handle backward adjustments
                    while total_hours > 0:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        total_hours -= 1

                # Apply remaining seconds
                other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds * 60)

                return other

            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment logic for business hours and uses the build-in timedelta function to properly perform adjustments for business hours. It also includes checks specifically for CustomBusinessHour objects before performing the adjustments.
