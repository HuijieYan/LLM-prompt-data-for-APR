The bug in the given function is causing a ValueError to be raised when using CustomBusinessHour with pd.date_range for a given frequency.

The main issue in the buggy function is how it handles adjustments for the business hours. The function is intended to return a new datetime based on a given input datetime and number of business hours, adjusting for weekends, holidays, and business hours. However, the logic inside the function that handles these adjustments is flawed, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `apply` function to ensure proper adjustments for business days, business hours, and holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        if n >= 0:
            # Handle adjustments for non-business hours and holidays
            while n > 0:
                # Move to the next opening time if the current time is not a business hour
                if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                # Subtract the time spent in the current business hour
                time_left_in_business_hour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if n * 60 < time_left_in_business_hour.total_seconds():
                    other += timedelta(minutes=n * 60)
                    n = 0
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= time_left_in_business_hour.total_seconds() // 60
        else:
            # Handle adjustments for non-business hours and holidays
            while n < 0:
                # Move to the previous opening time if the current time is a business hour
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix to the given function, the problematic ValueError raised during tests involving CustomBusinessHour with pd.date_range should be resolved.
