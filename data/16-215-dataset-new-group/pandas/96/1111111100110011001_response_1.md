The buggy function has several issues that need fixing:

1. The logic inside the function needs to be revised to ensure that it correctly handles the given `other` input.
2. The return value of the function should match the expected `datetime` type.

Based on the error message and the expected input/output variable values, they rely on computations of business hours, but some calculations, such as `bd` and `r`, involve the `BusinessDay` class. These require alignment with key conditions and calculations for business hours inside the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Other helper functions and class declarations remain the same if there are no changes expected in them.

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other function declarations remain the same if there are no changes expected in them.

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # Handle cases where business hour does not fall on the offset time
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other): # If other is not on the offset, move it to the next opening time
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start: # If other matches with start time, adjust the time to the previous day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other): # If other is not on the offset, then adjust it to the next opening time and closing time
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Compute the total business hours in one business day
            total_business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Calculate business days and remaining business hours to adjust
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0: # Adjust by business days first
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other): # adjust to previous business day if it's not on offset
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Loop to adjust remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The aforementioned corrected version addresses the identified issues and should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided for each case.
