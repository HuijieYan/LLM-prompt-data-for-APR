The bug in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class within `pandas.tseries.offsets` is causing the failing test in GitHub issue #30593. The bug occurs when using `pd.date_range()` with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in an unexpected number of periods in the output.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the datetime to account for the holidays and custom business hours is incorrect. It leads to an incorrect number of periods being calculated, as seen in the failing test. Specifically, the adjustment to reduce the number of cases to handle and the logic for adjusting the business days are the parts of the function that are likely responsible for the bug. 

To fix the bug, you need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to accurately account for the custom business hours and holidays. This may involve refining the logic for adjusting the datetime, business hours, and business days to ensure the correct number of periods is produced.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
        # Set the adjusted datetime (other) to the next business hour if it falls outside or on the holiday
        if self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Get the total business hours by second in one business day
        businesshours = np.timedelta64(1, 'h') * sum([(e - s) for s, e in zip(self.start, self.end)])
        
        # Calculate the number of business hours represented by 'n' 
        n_business_hours = self.n * businesshours / np.timedelta64(60, 's')
        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=n_business_hours % 60)

        # Move the datetime to the next business day
        while self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Forward the datetime by the number of business days represented by 'n'
        if self.n < 0:
            remaining_business_hours = -remaining_business_hours
        other += self.n * np.busday_offset(1, 'D', roll='forward', holidays=self.holidays) * np.timedelta64(1, 'D')    

        # Update the datetime by the remaining business hours
        other += remaining_business_hours

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle both custom business hours and holidays properly, resolving the issue mentioned in the failing test case and GitHub issue #30593.
