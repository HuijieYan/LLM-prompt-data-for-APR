The buggy function "apply" contains several potential error locations. After analyzing the failing test and the error message, the bug appears to result from the incorrect handling of holidays in the "CustomBusinessHour" offset when calculating the date range.

The failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" and the error message indicate that the frequency validation fails for the provided index and frequency. This error is due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to an incorrect date range.

To fix the bug, an adjustment needs to be made in the "pandas/tseries/offsets.py" file, specifically in the "CustomBusinessHour" offset's handling of holidays. It seems that the "apply" function is not correctly adjusting for holidays when calculating the date range.

To correct the bug, it is recommended to make changes related to the adjustment of holiday dates and how the holidays are being considered in the "apply" function. The corrected version should take into account the holidays to ensure that the date range is calculated accurately, as expected.

This adjusted version of the function should consider holidays correctly while calculating the date range with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

Here is the corrected version of the "apply" function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # adjust for holidays
        if getattr(self, 'holidays', None) is not None:
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if other == holiday:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # ... (remaining existing code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the "apply" function accounts for holidays by checking if the offset has any holidays defined and adjusting the "other" date accordingly.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to the incorrect behavior of the date range with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays.
