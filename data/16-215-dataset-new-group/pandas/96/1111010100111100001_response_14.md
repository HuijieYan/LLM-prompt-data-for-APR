The bug in the `apply` function is likely to be caused by the incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime when the `n` parameter is greater than or equal to 0. In these cases, the adjustments to `other` may lead to incorrect values or overshooting the expected time, causing unexpected behavior.

The `apply` function should calculate the business hours from the given time, adjust for business days if necessary, and then adjust for any remaining business hours.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to review the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime in cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and ensure that the adjustment aligns with the expected behavior. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately handles the remaining time.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Perform necessary adjustments based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                # Move to the next business day if the current time is outside of business hours
                if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                # Move to the previous business day if the current time is outside of business hours
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                n += 1

        # Calculate total business hours by second in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first if necessary
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Move to the next business day
            other += skip_bd

        # Adjust the remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Move to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Move to the previous business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using this corrected version of the `apply` function, the identified test cases should now pass without raising exceptions.
