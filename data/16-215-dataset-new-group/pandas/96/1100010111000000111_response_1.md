The cause of the bug is due to the faulty logic in the `apply` function, which is used to adjust the input `other` based on the specified business hours and holidays. The buggy function is failing to properly adjust for the holidays, leading to incorrect output when using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Identifying the root cause of the incorrect behavior by analyzing the logic in the `apply` function.
2. Correcting the logic to properly handle adjustments for holidays while calculating the business hours.
3. Ensuring that the adjusted `other` value aligns with the expected behavior when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Ignore timezone and nanosecond from the input datetime
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            0,  # Set microseconds to 0
        )

        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.onOffset(other):
            other += self
        else:
            # Adjust for holidays and non-business time
            while not self.onOffset(other):
                other += self
                if other.time() not in self.end:
                    other += pd.Timedelta('1h')  # Move to the next business hour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the `apply` function should properly handle the adjustment for holidays, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected behavior, as demonstrated in the failing test case. The corrected function should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and allow for proper behavior of `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`.
