The buggy function is the `apply` function, which manipulates datetime values based on custom business hours. Based on the runtime results, the function appears to incorrectly adjust the datetime values in certain cases, resulting in incorrect outputs. The issue cited in the GitHub report also suggests a similar problem where adding holidays led to more periods than intended in the date_range.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements and calculations related to adjusting the datetime values based on business days, business hours, and holidays.

The cause of the bug is likely related to inconsistencies in the adjustment logic for datetime values with respect to custom business hours and holidays. This could lead to incorrect increments or decrements in the datetime values, affecting the final output.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for the datetime values based on custom business hours, holidays, and business days needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially revised to ensure the correct adjustment of the datetime values.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        adjust_datetime = False
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other) if self.n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
            adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time) if self.n < 0 else adjusted_time
            if self.n != 0:
                business_day = BusinessDay(n=self.n)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    remain = adjusted_time - prev_open
                    adjusted_time = prev_open + business_day + remain
                    adjust_datetime = True
                else:
                    adjusted_time += business_day
                    adjust_datetime = True
            bhour_remain = abs(self.n) * 60
            while bhour_remain > 0:
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)) - adjusted_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour.seconds // 60:
                        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                        bhour_remain = 0
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) - adjusted_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour.seconds // 60 or (bhour_remain == bhour.seconds // 60 and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                        bhour_remain = 0
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            return adjusted_time if adjust_datetime else other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic for the datetime values based on business days, business hours, and holidays has been improved to ensure the correct adjustment of the datetime values.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and fix the bug in the `apply` function.
