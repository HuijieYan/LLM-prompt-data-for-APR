The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is due to the mishandling of the CustomBusinessHour offset. When the `pd.date_range` function is called in the failing test, it invokes the `apply` function to manipulate the dates with the CustomBusinessHour offset. The mishandling leads to an error during the validation of the frequency, resulting in a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to address the mishandling of the CustomBusinessHour offset and make necessary adjustments to ensure the correct application of the offset in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# import the necessary datetime module
import datetime

# Rest of the code remains the same

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other defined functions remain the same

    # Fixed version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):  # Check if the input is a datetime object
            # Reduce the number of cases to handle by resetting the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if datetime.time(other.hour, other.minute, other.second) in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if datetime.time(other.hour, other.minute, other.second) in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other -= datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Rest of the adjustments in the function remain the same
            ...
            # The rest of the function remains the same
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should fix the mishandling of the CustomBusinessHour offset and ensure that the function works correctly with the failing test.
