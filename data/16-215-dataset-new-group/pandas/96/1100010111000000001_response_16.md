The buggy function `apply` appears to be designed to adjust a datetime object according to a business hour offset. However, it fails to handle some edge cases and may not be applying the business hours correctly. 

The potential error locations within the function could be improper handling of adjustments to business days, adjusting business hours, and calculations.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` sets a custom business hour frequency and generates a date range. The expected date range is then compared with the actual result.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to carefully review and correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object according to the business hour offset.

Here's a corrected version of the function `apply`:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)

        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other = other + bd * pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = min(self._get_closing_time(other.replace(nanosecond=0)) - other, bhour_remain)
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = min(self._next_opening_time(other.replace(nanosecond=0)) - other, bhour_remain)
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
