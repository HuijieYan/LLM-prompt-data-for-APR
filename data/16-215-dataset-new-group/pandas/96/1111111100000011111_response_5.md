To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issues observed in its behavior. Here's the strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the logic that calculates the datetime values in the buggy function.
2. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime values based on business hours and holidays are correctly reflected in the output.
3. Validate the conditional statements to ensure that the correct offsets are applied to the datetime values.
4. Check if any nested functions used in the buggy function are behaving as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function, which addresses the issues and provides the expected output:
```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
    pass

# Corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin:
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            # Calculate the total number of business hours between start and end
            businesshours = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[-1], holidays=holidays).delta
            # Calculate the adjusted datetime values based on business hours and holidays
            adjusted_datetime = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[-1], holidays=holidays).apply(other)
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the corrected version of the function, the issues related to applying business hours and holidays to date ranges should be resolved. Now, running the function with the given cases and using the corrected function should produce the expected output. This updated implementation ensures that holidays are considered correctly and that the datetime adjustments align with the expected business hours.

This corrected version should address the issue reported and provide the expected output based on the test cases provided.
