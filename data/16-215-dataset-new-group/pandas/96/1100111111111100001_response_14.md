Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we can identify several potential issues that lead to the failing test. The key area to focus on is the calculation and adjustment of the business hours by second and the adjustment of the timestamp.

It appears that the business hour adjustment logic is not handling the case where the next business day should be considered. Additionally, there are conditional statements that may not be correctly adjusting the timestamps based on business hours.

For fixing the bug, a potential strategy is to carefully review the logic for adjusting timestamps and business hours. The logic needs to properly handle cases where the next business day needs to be considered for the adjustments.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        # Adjust business hours for current day
        if other.time() >= self.start[0] and other.time() < self.end[0] and self._is_on_offset(other):
            businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
        else:
            businesshours = 0

        # Calculate business day adjustment
        total_minutes = (self.n * 60) - businesshours
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(total_minutes), 60)
        if total_minutes < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        # Adjust to next business day if necessary
        if business_days != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if remaining_hours != 0:
            while remaining_hours != 0:
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if remaining_hours < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the business hour adjustment logic has been simplified and fixed to properly handle the adjustment of timestamps and business days. Additionally, the calculation of business hours and minutes has been restructured to accurately adjust the timestamps.
