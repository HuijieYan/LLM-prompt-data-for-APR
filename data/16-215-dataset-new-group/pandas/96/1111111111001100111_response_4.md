The buggy function has several issues that are leading to the failing test. Here are the identified issues:

1. Incorrect comparison between timestamps and dates: The function is comparing `other.time()` with `self.end` and `self.start`, but `other.time()` returns a time object, not a timestamp object. This might lead to incorrect comparisons and improper handling of business hours around holidays.
2. Incorrect date adjustment logic: The logic for adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays is overly complex and contains redundant code, which is also causing issues with the result.
3. Incorrect logic for checking and adjusting business days: The condition and logic for adjusting business days are not reliable and could result in incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be rewritten for better clarity and accuracy. The logic for adjusting dates, handling business days, and comparing time objects with start and end times needs to be revisited.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# -- Other functions and class methods remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
            
            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by simplifying the date adjustment logic and improving the correctness of comparisons and adjustments related to business hours and holidays. After applying these changes, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
