The buggy function seems to be causing an issue when adding holidays to a CustomBusinessHour frequency in pd.date_range. This is evidenced by the failing test and the GitHub issue posted.

## Identifying the potential error location
The error is likely occurring in the apply method of the CustomBusinessHour class. Since the function is performing computations based on business hours and holidays, it is likely that the bug originates from the logic inside the apply method relating to holiday calculations and handling.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug may be related to how the apply method handles holidays and the computation of business hours. It seems to be incorrectly calculating the periods in the presence of holidays, leading to an unexpected behavior in pd.date_range when used with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, the apply method should be carefully reviewed to ensure that it handles holidays and period calculations correctly. Additionally, proper testing with different combinations of holidays and periods should be conducted to validate the behavior of the apply method.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# other imports as needed

class CustomBusinessHour:
    # ... other methods and properties

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle holidays by skipping them in the frequency
            while other in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)

            # rest of the computation as before
            # ... existing logic ...

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the apply method first checks if the other value falls on a holiday. If it does, it skips the holiday by adding one hour to the datetime before proceeding with the rest of the computation. This should prevent the unexpected behavior observed when using pd.date_range with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays.
