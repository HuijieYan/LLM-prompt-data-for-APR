The bug in the `apply` function is preventing the correct calculation of business hours when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays. This is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce incorrect results when periods and holidays are used together.

The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours, particularly when adjusting for holidays and non-business hours.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for holidays and non-business hours needs to be reviewed, as these adjustments are likely causing the incorrect output in the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        offset = self._offset
        normalized = self._is_normalized(other)

        # handle holidays and non-business hours
        while n != 0:
            other = offset.apply(other, normalized=normalized)
            if offset._is_on_offset(other):
                # on offset, adjust business hours
                if n > 0:
                    other += offset.freq
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other -= offset.freq
                    n += 1
            else:
                # non-business hour, move to the next opening time
                other = offset._next_opening_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version applies the business hour offset using a while loop to handle holidays and non-business hours properly. It adjusts the datetime according to the business hours and correctly handles the edge conditions.

By using this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the `pd.date_range` function should produce the expected output when using periods and holidays together.
