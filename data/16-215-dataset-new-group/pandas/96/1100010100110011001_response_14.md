The issue in the given buggy function is related to its core implementation. The function attempts to perform business hour adjustments to a given datetime, but due to mismanagement among checks to be made, the function returns an incorrect datetime. The expected outputs are not coherent with the specified cases for all parameters. To fix the bug, it will be necessary to correct the datetime adjustment steps and ensure that the logic for adjusting business hours is not disrupted. The time adjustments should be performed more systematically with appropriate condition checks.

The fix for this bug involves making the adjustments more targeted and ensuring that the calculations for business days and business hours are accurate.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0 and (other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if other.time() < self.next_bday.start_time:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(opening_time) - other
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = opening_time - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version considers the adjustments for both positive and negative offsets and ensures an accurate computation for business days and business hours. It also addresses the adjustments based on business hour intervals.

The corrected function should now pass the specified test cases and provide the expected outputs for each case.
