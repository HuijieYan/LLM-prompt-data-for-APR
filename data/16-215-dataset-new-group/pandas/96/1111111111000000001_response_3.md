The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` which is in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime according to business hours and returns the adjusted datetime. However, the function seems to have issues with adjusting the datetime properly, especially when negative business hours are involved.

Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative business hours seems complex and may result in incorrect adjustments.
2. The logic for handling business day skips and remaining business hours seems convoluted and not straightforward.

Cause of the bug:
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing because the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hour frequency provided.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative business hours needs to be simplified and made more intuitive. Additionally, the logic for handling business day skips and remaining business hours needs to be revised to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Import necessary libraries if not already imported
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= pd.offsets.Hour()
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), business_hours // 3600)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r * 60)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour > bhour_remain or (bhour == bhour_remain and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime according to business hours and should correctly handle positive and negative business hours. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
