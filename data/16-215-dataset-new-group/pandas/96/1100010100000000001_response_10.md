The buggy function seems to be designed to adjust a given datetime object by a specified number of business hours, based on the current pandas library behavior.

The potential errors in this function could be caused by:
1. Incorrect handling of the datetime object, which may lead to unexpected results.
2. Inconsistent logic for adjusting the datetime object in positive and negative scenarios.
3. Handling of edge cases, such as when the datetime object is at the end or start of the business day.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function could be related to the inconsistent application of adjustments to the datetime object based on the number of business hours to be added or subtracted.

To fix the bug, the function needs a more systematic approach to adjusting the datetime object based on the specified number of business hours. This could involve simplifying the logic and ensuring consistent handling of edge cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_seconds_in_business_day = self._calculate_total_business_hours()

        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n) * 60, total_seconds_in_business_day // 60)

        if n < 0:
            business_days = -business_days
            remaining_seconds = -remaining_seconds

        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, business_days)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds)

        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_timedelta.total_seconds() != 0:
                remaining_timedelta = self._adjust_for_positive_hours(other, remaining_timedelta)
        else:
            while remaining_timedelta.total_seconds() != 0:
                remaining_timedelta = self._adjust_for_negative_hours(other, remaining_timedelta)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, care has been taken to ensure consistent handling of positive and negative scenarios, as well as potentially problematic edge cases. Additionally, the handling of business days and the remaining business hours to adjust has been made more systematic.
