The buggy function `apply` is part of the `pandas` library and is being used internally within the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding a holiday. The user is experiencing unexpected results when adding holidays, which is causing date_range to produce more than the specified number of periods.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the calculation and adjustments made within the `apply` function when dealing with holidays and business hours.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic within the `apply` function, particularly the handling of holidays, business hours, and time adjustments. Additional checks and adjustments may be needed to ensure that the provided `other` datetime remains within the expected boundary of business hours and properly accounts for skipped time due to holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours()
        
        # Adjust for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Calculate the total number of business days and remaining time
        business_days, remaining_time = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_time = -business_days, -remaining_time
        
        # Adjust the date by the number of business days
        if business_days != 0:
            other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, business_days)
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_time > timedelta(0):
                remaining_in_interval = self._get_remaining_time_in_interval(other)
                if remaining_time < remaining_in_interval:
                    other += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time -= remaining_in_interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_in_interval)
        else:
            while remaining_time < timedelta(0):
                remaining_in_interval = self._get_remaining_time_in_interval(other)
                if abs(remaining_time) < remaining_in_interval:
                    other += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time += remaining_in_interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other - remaining_in_interval)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for holidays, business days, and the remaining business hours within each time interval. It aims to handle the described issue with periods and holidays within the CustomBusinessHour class.
