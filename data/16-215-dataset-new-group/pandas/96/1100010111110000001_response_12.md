The bug in the `apply` function arises due to the incorrect handling of `CustomBusinessHour` offset in pandas. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tests the behavior of this offset but encounters a `ValueError` due to incorrect frequency validation.

The issue lies in the `apply` function, which does not correctly process the business hours and shift the date and time according to the specified business hours. As a result, incorrect dates and frequencies are generated, leading to a validation error in the test.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be refactored to correctly adjust the dates and times according to the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        openings = self._parse_custom_start()
        closes = self._parse_custom_end()
        start_day = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        if n >= 0:
            days, remainder = divmod(n, len(openings))
            if remainder == 0:
                days -= 1
                remainder = len(openings)
            current = start_day
            for i in range(days):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(current)
                current = next_opening
            idx = remainder - 1
            opening = openings[idx]
            if current.time() >= opening:
                current = self._next_opening_time(current)
            if current.date() == start_day.date():
                idx = (idx + 1) % len(openings)
                current = current.replace(hour=openings[idx].hour, minute=openings[idx].minute, second=0)
            else:
                current = current.replace(hour=openings[idx].hour, minute=openings[idx].minute, second=0)
        else:
            days, remainder = divmod(abs(n), len(closes))
            if remainder == 0 and days != 0:
                days -= 1
                remainder = len(closes)
            current = start_day
            for i in range(days):
                prev_closing = self._get_closing_time(current)
                current = prev_closing
            idx = remainder - 1
            closing = closes[idx]
            if current.time() <= closing:
                current = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(current) - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1))
                if current.date() in self.holidays:
                    current = self._prev_opening_time(current)
            else:
                current = current.replace(hour=closes[idx].hour, minute=closes[idx].minute, second=0)
        return current
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After replacing the buggy `apply` function with the corrected version, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass, and no `ValueError` should be encountered.
