## Code Analysis
The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is producing unexpected results when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `on_freq` variable not matching the expected frequency.

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it seems that the calculation for adjusting business hours and days is causing the unexpected behavior. The logic for adjusting other to reduce the number of cases to handle may be incorrect, leading to incorrect frequency matching.

The bug affects the output values of the `apply` function, where the final adjusted datetime objects do not match the expected frequencies, causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is an incorrect adjustment of business hours and days, which leads to the frequency mismatch when using the `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays. This leads to unexpected dates and times in the output, causing the frequency validation to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to ensure that the output datetime objects conform to the expected frequencies. Additionally, proper validation checks for frequency matching should be included to prevent frequency validation errors.

The calculation for adjusting business hours and days should be updated to accurately adjust the given timestamps according to the provided rules and holidays, ensuring that the resulting dates and times match the expected frequencies.

```

The revised `apply` function includes updated adjustments for business hours and days, ensuring that the resulting output datetime objects conform to the expected frequencies when used with the `pd.date_range` function. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and align the behavior of the function with the expected input/output values.
