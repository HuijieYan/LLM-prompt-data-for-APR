The buggy function is intended to apply a custom business hour offset to a given timestamp, adjusting for business days and remaining business hours. It appears that there are issues with the application of the custom business hour offset and adjustments, leading to unexpected behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The adjustment logic for handling positive and negative `n` values, as well as for handling business days and remaining business hours.
2. The logic for checking and adjusting timestamps based on business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustment logic does not correctly handle the custom business hour offset, leading to incorrect results as observed in the failing tests. Specifically, the adjustments for positive and negative `n` values may not be working as intended, which impacts the final output of the function.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and revising the adjustment logic to ensure that it correctly applies the custom business hour offset to the given timestamp while accounting for positive and negative `n` values, business days, and remaining business hours.

Based on the analysis, the buggy apply function can be fixed as follows:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    adjusted_time = other
    n = self.n

    # Apply custom business hour offset
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            adjusted_time = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

    # Apply total business hours by sec in one business day
    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r
    
    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
            remain = adjusted_time - prev_open
            adjusted_time = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            adjusted_time += skip_bd

    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)) - adjusted_time
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # Finish adjusting if possible
                adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # Go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour)
    else:
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) - adjusted_time
            
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                # Finish adjusting if possible
                adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # Go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

    return adjusted_time
```

By correcting the adjustment logic and ensuring that the custom business hour offset is correctly applied to the given timestamp, the fixed apply function should address the issues observed in the failing tests. This corrected version is expected to resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
