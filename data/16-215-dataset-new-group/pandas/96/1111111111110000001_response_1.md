The bug in the `apply` function appears to be caused by the logic for adjusting the business hours. The error message from the failing test indicates a problem with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency, which suggests an issue with the adjustment of business hours in the function.

This suggests that the bug might be related to the adjustment of business hours in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect adjustment of dates and times based on the specified business hours. 

The strategy for fixing the bug involves carefully reviewing the logic for adjusting business hours within the `apply` function. This may involve debugging the specific adjustment steps to ensure that the dates and times are correctly aligned with the specified business hours.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function with the potential bug fixed:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Depending on the specific business logic, further adjustments may be necessary, but this correction aims to address the potential bug related to the adjustment of business hours based on the given input date and time.
