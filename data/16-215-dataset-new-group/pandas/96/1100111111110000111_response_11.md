The bug in the `apply` function comes from improperly using `self.next_bday` instead of `self.next_bday()` to call the method. This results in unexpected behavior when adding holidays, leading to the failing test and the issue described on GitHub.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the line `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` to `if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):` to properly call the `next_bday` method.
2. Import `numpy` as 'np' to use the `np.array_equal` method within the function.
3. Fix the conditional `if bd != 0:` to properly check if business days need to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# ... other parts of the file remain the same...

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    # ... unchanged lines ...

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                other = as_datetime(self.next_bday()._apply_rule(other))
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # ... unchanged lines ...

    return other
```

With these changes, the function should work as expected and pass the failing test while resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
