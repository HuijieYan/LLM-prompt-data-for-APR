The bug in the `apply` function causes the failure in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test function. The error message indicates that the frequency is not valid due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The bug causes the CustomBusinessHour frequency to not handle holidays correctly, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the periods when holidays are included. This leads to the creation of more than the specified number of periods, causing the failure in the test.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the holidays when adjusting the custom business hours.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._next_opening_time(other.replace(minute=0))
                other = prev_open + pd.DateOffset(hours=1)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n == 0 and other.minute == 0:
            # When n == 0 and other is on an hour boundary, adjust the minute to 0
            return other

        # Get the total business hours for one business day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Use the CustomBusinessHour to handle the business day and hour adjustments
        c_freq = CustomBusinessHour(*self.start, *self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
        other = other + c_freq * n

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
# Add the corrected function to the pandas.tseries.offsets module
pd.tseries.offsets.apply = apply
```

In this corrected version of the `apply` function:
- The logic for adjusting business days and hours has been refactored to utilize the CustomBusinessHour frequency for handling holidays.
- The adjustments for handling holidays and adjusting the business day have been modified to accurately calculate the periods when holidays are included.

With these modifications, the corrected `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
