The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect adjustment of business days, which is causing incorrect calculations and subsequent issues with the date_range function when adding holidays. The incorrect adjustment of business days is most likely leading to the unexpected behavior when calculating the end datetime, resulting in more than 14 periods.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # unchanged code block

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other - skip_bd
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours has been modified to ensure correct calculations and adjustments, fixing the bug related to unexpected behavior with the date_range function when adding holidays.
