After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it can be observed that the function is meant to adjust datetime values based on business hours, but it is not working correctly. The primary issue appears to be in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours. The logic for adjusting the remaining business hours seems to be incorrect and is leading to incorrect outputs for the given test cases.

The cause of the bug seems to be the faulty logic in adjusting the remaining business hours and handling the next business time interval. This is causing the datetime to be adjusted incorrectly and leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, it is essential to review the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours and handling the next business time interval. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the business day and remaining business hour calculations to ensure they are correct.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        if n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            remaining_working_minutes = int(((other - datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])).total_seconds() / 60) % businesshours)
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60 + remaining_working_minutes, businesshours // 60)
            
            if r >= remaining_working_minutes:
                other += timedelta(minutes=(r-remaining_working_minutes))
                bd += 1
            else:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0]) + timedelta(minutes=r)

            if bd > 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other, n=bd)
        else:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(minutes=self._get_minutes_offset(other) + 1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            remaining_working_minutes = int(((datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0]) - other).total_seconds() / 60) % businesshours)
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60 - remaining_working_minutes, businesshours // 60)

            if r >= remaining_working_minutes:
                other -= timedelta(minutes=(r-remaining_working_minutes))
                bd += 1
            else:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0]) - timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if bd < 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other, n=bd)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version addresses the issues with business day and remaining business hour calculations and should now pass the failing test.
