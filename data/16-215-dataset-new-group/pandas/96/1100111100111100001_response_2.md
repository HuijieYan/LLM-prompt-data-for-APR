The main issue is that the timestamps are being manipulated on an hourly basis, but the calculations are not being accurately implemented. The function is not correctly calculating the offset from the provided timestamp.

The code is attempting to adjust the end times to the next business day and adding complete business days, but it seems that it is not accounting for the calculation properly. Additionally, it is not handling the case where the timestamps are already on a business hour.

A strategy to fix this bug would involve refining the logic for handling the offset calculation and adjusting the timestamps. This should involve correctly handling the edge cases, including when the timestamps are already on a business hour, and correctly adjusting for multiple business days in both positive and negative directions.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n > 0:
            while n > 0:
                temp_other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=self.end[0].minute)
                if temp_other <= other:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                diff = other - temp_other
                bhour_remain = timedelta(hours=diff.hours, minutes=diff.minutes)
                
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
        
        elif n < 0:
            n_positive = abs(n)
            while n_positive > 0:
                temp_other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                if temp_other >= other:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                diff = temp_other - other
                bhour_remain = timedelta(hours=diff.hours, minutes=diff.minutes)
                
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= 0:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n_positive -= 1
        
        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the offset calculations are computed correctly, and the edge cases are handled appropriately. This should resolve the issues identified with the failing tests.
