The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This function is intended to handle business hour offsets, and it appears to have issues with adjusting timestamps to the next business day within predefined business hours.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` involves creating a DatetimeIndex using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency. The expected result is a DatetimeIndex that matches specific timestamps based on the custom business hour frequency, but the test is currently failing with a ValueError relating to frequency validation.

The error message indicates that the bug is caused by an issue in frequency validation, specifically that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency (CBH). This issue is related to the adjustment of timestamps within business hours and the handling of business day offsets within the buggy function `apply`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix strategy involves analyzing the logic within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It will be necessary to review the logic for adjusting timestamps to the next business day within the specified business hours, handling business day offsets, and ensuring the frequency validation for the custom business hour frequency is correctly applied.

Here's a corrected version for the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing functions and methods...
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjusting timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Adjusting other to align with business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours_in_secs = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_in_secs // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjusting by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                 other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)  # Adjust using CustomBusinessDay offset

            # Getting the remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(n=0, start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0])  # Initialize the remaining hours
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = 0
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = 0
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected version focuses on ensuring that the adjustments are made in a way that aligns with the specified business hours and handles business day offsets correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the frequency validation issue related to custom business hour offsets and ensure the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` passes successfully.
