The buggy function has several issues that need to be fixed in order to address the failing test. The main problems appear to be related to the way the function handles the adjustment of the `other` datetime object. 

The buggy function, `apply(self, other)`, is an instance method that uses several instance variables of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. It is designed to apply the business offset to a given datetime object `other` by adjusting it based on business hours and business days.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values, it appears that the adjustment logic within the function is flawed. The adjustment process for handling positive and negative business offsets could be incorrect, leading to incorrect adjustments of the `other` datetime object.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revisiting the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the business offset. This logic should be carefully reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that it correctly applies the business offset as intended.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                    else:
                        other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_opening - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = next_opening
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = closing_time - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

The corrected version of the function applies a more robust logic to handle the adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on business hours and business days, taking into account both positive and negative business offsets.

By replacing the adjustment logic with a more accurate and correct implementation, the corrected function should address the failing test case and resolve the identified bug.
