The bug in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file appears to cause inaccurate calculations in certain special cases, which affects the behavior of the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test function.

The potential bug locations in the `apply` function are around the following areas:
1. The adjustment of "other" based on positive/negative values of self.n
2. The computation of businesshours, bd, and r
3. The adjustment by business days
4. The remaining business hours to adjust

The cause of the bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments and computations within the `apply` function, leading to out-of-range or incorrect datetime outputs when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve reviewing and revising the logic for adjusting "other" based on self.n, computing business hours, adjusting by business days, and dealing with remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
  # ... [other functions remain as is]
  
  def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            adjusted_time = other
            holiday = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time) + timedelta(days=1)

            while n != 0:
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                if adjusted_time.date() in self.holidays or adjusted_time.date() == holiday.date():
                    continue
                n += (-1 if n > 0 else 1)
            
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have replaced the complex adjustment logic with a more straightforward approach to ensure proper working of `apply` function.

Please note that this corrected version assumes that the related classes and methods remain unchanged and that the custom business hour and day classes have the necessary methods implemented for this corrected logic to work as expected.
