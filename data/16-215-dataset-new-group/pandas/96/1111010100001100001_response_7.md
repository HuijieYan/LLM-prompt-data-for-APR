The buggy function contains issues where the manipulation of the `other` variable does not seem to occur consistently, leading to errors in adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters.

It seems that the function `apply` is trying to adjust the `other` variable by adding or subtracting business hours based on the value of `self.n`. The manipulations are done in terms of business days and business hours by seconds. However, the inconsistencies in the adjustments to the `other` variable lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments to the `other` variable follow a consistent and correct logic, taking into account the positive or negative value of `self.n` and properly handling the remaining business hours to adjust.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour.total_seconds() <= n * 60:
                    n -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=n)
                    n = 0
        else:
            n = abs(n)
            while n > 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour.total_seconds() <= n * 60:
                    n -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=n)
                    n = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the remaining business hours to adjust in a more consistent and accurate manner. We iteratively adjust the `other` variable while considering the positive or negative value of `self.n`. This should handle the business hour adjustments more effectively and eliminate the bugs observed in the previous implementation.
