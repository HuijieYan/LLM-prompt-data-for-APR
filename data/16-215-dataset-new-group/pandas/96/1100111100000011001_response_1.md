To fix the bug in the provided function, I first observed that the function references several other functions and classes. The correction will require understanding these functions' roles and ensuring proper integration with them.

The issue seems to be that some business hours are not being calculated accurately. The adjustment for business days also requires checking and updating the while loops to ensure that the time adjustments are done correctly.

To fix the bug, I'll first correct the calculations to ensure business hours are accurately calculated and adjusted. Then, I'll fix the adjustment for business days and introduce a check to prevent the while loops from running infinite loops.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Other relevant imports are assumed to be in place

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other class methods and functions...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    if other == self._get_closing_time(other):
                        break
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
