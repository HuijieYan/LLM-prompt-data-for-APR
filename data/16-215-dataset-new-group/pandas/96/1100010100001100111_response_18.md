The buggy function has multiple potential error locations within the function, including the transformation of the 'other' variable and the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. The root cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles business hours, particularly when combined with holidays, resulting in incorrect computations and timestamps. 

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the function to correctly adjust business days and hours, ensuring that holidays are properly accounted for.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        total_seconds = n * 3600  # calculate total seconds from hours

        # Handle business days adjustment
        if n >= 0:
            bd, r = divmod(abs(total_seconds), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
        else:
            bd = (total_seconds // businesshours) - 1
            r = total_seconds % businesshours

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # Adjust by business days
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

        # Business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment of business days and hours more accurately, ensuring holidays are appropriately considered. With these modifications, the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
