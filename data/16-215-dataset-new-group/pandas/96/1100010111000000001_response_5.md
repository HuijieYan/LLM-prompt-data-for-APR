The buggy function is returning incorrect results because it fails to adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays, particularly when stepping into the next business day.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the logic that adjusts the datetime to the next business day, and in the adjustment of business hours remaining to match the frequency. 

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours, leading to incorrect results when dealing with holidays or stepping into the next business day.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for adjusting the datetime to ensure it correctly accounts for the specified business hours and holidays, and properly steps into the next business day.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust time to next available business hour
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjust time to previous available business hour
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        total_seconds = abs(n * 60 * business_hours * 60)

        if n < 0:
            total_seconds = -total_seconds

        # Adjust by business days
        business_days = total_seconds // (business_hours * 3600)
        other = other + business_days * BDay(calendar=self.calendar)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_seconds = total_seconds % (business_hours * 3600)
        adjusted_time = self._adjust_time(other, remaining_seconds)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays, and resolve the bug that caused the failing test.

Note: Depending on the actual implementation details for the `apply` function and the associated objects in the pandas library, further adjustments may be needed. This solution is based on the provided code and the logic inferred from it.
