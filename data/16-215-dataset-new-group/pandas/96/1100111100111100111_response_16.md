The issue with the `apply` function is that it is not correctly adjusting the `other` datetime based on the business hours and holidays when applying a custom business hour offset. This leads to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The key problems in the `apply` function are related to the adjustments made to the `other` datetime, the calculations involving business days, and the adjustments based on business hours. The incorrect adjustments are leading to outputs that do not align with the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function.

Based on the input parameters and observed runtime values, it's evident that the `apply` function is not properly handling the adjustment of business hours, business days, and holidays, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this issue, the `apply` function should be modified to handle the adjustments of `other` datetime correctly, accounting for holidays, business hours, and business days. Proper handling of business days and business hours within the function should result in the `pd.date_range` function producing the expected output.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_day_offset = 0
        remaining_business_hours = 0
        business_day_adjust = CustomBusinessDay()
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
            if self.n > 0:
                # For positive offsets, adjust for business hours within the same day
                business_hours_until_closing = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if remaining_business_hours < business_hours_until_closing:
                    other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= business_hours_until_closing
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_until_closing)
            else:
                # For negative offsets, adjust for business hours within the same day
                business_hours_until_closing = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_business_hours > business_hours_until_closing:
                    other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= business_hours_until_closing
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + business_hours_until_closing - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By properly adjusting the `other` datetime based on the given business hour offset, the corrected `apply` function should resolve the unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays.
