### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class located in the file pandas/tseries/offsets.py.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError is occurring when using `pd.date_range` with a custom frequency and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue describes that using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays produces more than the specified number of periods, resulting in unexpected behavior.
4. The root cause of the bug appears to be within the logic of the `apply` function related to handling business hours and holidays. The issue is related to business hours computation and adjustment when incorporating holidays in the context of date range generation.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic in the `apply` function, particularly the handling of holidays, business hours, and time intervals. This involves incorporating holiday considerations and adjusting business hours calculation to ensure date range computation with custom frequency and holidays works as expected.

### Bug Fix:
After analyzing the buggy function and error message, a corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        frequency_hours = (self.end - self.start).seconds // 3600  # Calculate total business hours in the frequency
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(self.n) * 60, frequency_hours * 60)  # Split total hours into days and remaining hours

        # Handle adjustments for positive and negative business hours
        if self.n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
        else:
            other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other)) if other.time() in self.start else other - timedelta(seconds=1)

        # Adjust for business days, considering holidays
        if business_days != 0:
            adjust = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if other not in self:
                other = other + adjust
            else:
                other = other + adjust
                if other not in self:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
        if self.n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes several adjustments to improve the handling of business days, remaining hours, and adjustments based on positive/negative business hours. It seeks to address the issues associated with the computation of business hours, particularly in the context of generating date ranges with custom frequency and holidays.
