The main issue identified in the GitHub issue and the failing test cases seems to be that when using `pd.date_range` with the `freq` parameter set to `CustomBusinessHour` and providing holidays, the number of periods generated is larger than expected. This behavior is not consistent with the expected behavior.

Looking at the failing test cases and the error message, it seems that the issue may be related to the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. This method is responsible for modifying the input timestamp based on the business hours. There are multiple calculations and adjustments made within this method, which could potentially cause the unexpected behavior observed.

By analyzing the failing test cases and the error messages, it can be inferred that the current implementation of the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class is not correctly handling the adjustments and calculations for business hours, leading to incorrect results when holidays are included in the calculation.

It seems that the calculations for adjusting the timestamps based on business hours and holidays are not correctly accounting for the holidays and are resulting in additional periods being added to the `DatetimeIndex`.

To fix this issue, one possible strategy is to review and modify the logic inside the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class to ensure that the adjustments for holidays and business hours are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            business_days = custombday(self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            if self.n >= 0:
                adjusted_time = business_days.rollforward(other)
                closure_time = datetime(
                    adjusted_time.year,
                    adjusted_time.month,
                    adjusted_time.day,
                    self.end.hour,
                    self.end.minute,
                )
                if adjusted_time.time() >= closure_time.time():
                    adjusted_time = business_days.following(adjusted_time.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute))
            else:
                adjusted_time = business_days.rollback(other)
                closure_time = datetime(
                    adjusted_time.year,
                    adjusted_time.month,
                    adjusted_time.day,
                    self.end.hour,
                    self.end.minute,
                )
                if adjusted_time.time() > closure_time.time() or adjusted_time.time() == closure_time.time() and adjusted_time.microsecond > 0:
                    adjusted_time = business_days.following(adjusted_time.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute))

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the timestamps based on business hours and holidays has been modified to correctly handle the adjustments and ensure that the correct number of periods is generated in the `DatetimeIndex` when using `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays.

By reviewing the logic and making the necessary adjustments, the corrected `apply` method should produce the expected results and resolve the issue observed in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
