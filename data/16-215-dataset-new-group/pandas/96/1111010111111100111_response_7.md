Based on the runtime values and types of variables within the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of holidays when calculating business hours. The business hours are being calculated incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are included. This inconsistency leads to an incorrect output and causes the failing test.

To fix this bug, the calculation of business hours and the adjustment for holidays should be reviewed and revised. Additionally, the adjustment of other to reduce the number of cases to handle should be thoroughly evaluated.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.core.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
import pandas as pd

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin:

    # The corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            is_holiday = other in self.holidays
            step = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            i = 0

            while i < abs(n):
                # Check if the adjusted datetime is a holiday
                if is_holiday:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    is_holiday = other in self.holidays
                else:
                    i += 1
                    other += timedelta(hours=step)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")


# The test function can remain the same, as the changes are made to the class definition
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    # GH 30593
    freq = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

In the corrected version, the calculation for holidays is explicitly included in the adjustment loop, ensuring that the adjusted datetime aligns correctly with the business hours, taking into account holidays. After the correction to the `apply` function, the failing test case should be resolved.
