The buggy function is `apply` which is supposed to handle a business hour offset adjustment for a given datetime. The bug in the function leads to a ValueError when validating the frequency, which is causing the failing test.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The adjustment logic for business hour is complex and may not handle edge cases properly.
2. The business hour calculation and adjustment may not be accurately computed, leading to an invalid frequency validation.

The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by an incorrect adjustment of the business hour offset, which results in an invalid frequency validation when the frequency does not conform to the passed values.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The adjustment logic for business hours needs to be revisited and simplified to ensure accurate computations of the offset. Additionally, the validation logic for the frequency needs to be reviewed to avoid raising an incorrect ValueError.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
    # adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset
    if self.n > 0:
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    elif self.n < 0:
        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
    return other
```
