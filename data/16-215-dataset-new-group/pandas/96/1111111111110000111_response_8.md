The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to incorrect frequency generation when using the `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday`. 

The bug occurs in the `apply` function when it generates the frequency for the given dates and holidays. This leads to an incorrect number of periods, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the approach could be to amend the logic for applying holidays within the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The incorrect code seems to be located around the logic that adjusts the dates based on the number of business hours and the impact of holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other functions ...

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond, if applicable
            other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n

            # Check for edge conditions
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = shift_month(other, 1)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = shift_month(other, 1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After correcting the function, it needs to be tested against the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to verify the fix. If the corrected function passes the test, it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
