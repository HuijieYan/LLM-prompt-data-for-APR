The buggy function seems to be a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and has a decorator `@apply_wraps` applied to it. It takes in an argument `other`, and based on its type, it performs a series of calculations to adjust the time and return the updated time.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect function calls within the calculations, such as `next_bday` instead of `self.next_bday`.
2. Incorrect handling of business days and their respective openings and closings.
3. Improper comparison and adjustment of business hours.

One of the causes of the bug could be the incorrect referencing of methods within the class and the inaccurate handling of business day adjustments.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve making sure that all method calls within the class are correctly referenced with `self`. Additionally, revisiting the logic for handling business day adjustments, opening and closing times, and business hour calculations would be necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):  
    # other methods...
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjustments
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Business day adjustment
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, I have fixed the method calls and improved the logic for business day adjustments and business hour calculations.
