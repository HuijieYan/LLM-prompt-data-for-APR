The bug in the `apply` function is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, specifically when adding holidays. The function is used to adjust the given datetime by adding BusinessHour offsets. The unexpected behavior is causing more than the expected number of periods in the `date_range` output.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustments to the `other` datetime variable, which are supposed to handle scenarios related to business hours, business days, and business intervals, are not working as intended. The logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` (business hour offsets) is not correctly adjusting the `other` datetime, leading to incorrect results in the output.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on business hours and days needs to be reviewed and modified to correctly handle positive and negative offsets.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime) or isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while n > business_hours:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
                business_hours = self._get_business_hours(other)
        else:
            while n < -business_hours:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
                business_hours = self._get_business_hours(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime or Timestamp")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function modifies the logic for adjusting the `other` variable based on the positive and negative offsets, ensuring that the correct number of business hours are accounted for in the adjustments. This should address the issues observed in the `pd.date_range` function when using holidays and periods.
