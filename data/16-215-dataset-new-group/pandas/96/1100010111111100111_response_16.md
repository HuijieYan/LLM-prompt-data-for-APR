Based on the GitHub issue posted and the failing test, it seems that the `pd.date_range` function is producing more periods than expected when using a custom business hour frequency with holidays specified. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to replace the `periods` parameter with the corresponding `end` parameter. This implies that the issue may be related to how the `apply` function of `CustomBusinessHour` handles the computation of business hours in the presence of holidays.

Looking at the failing test and its corresponding error message, it seems that the issue arises from not handling holidays properly in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour`. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, with references to "Inferred frequency" and "passed frequency".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function of `CustomBusinessHour` takes holidays into account when adjusting the timestamp according to the business hour. This might require additional logic to skip over holiday dates and recompute the business hour adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function of `CustomBusinessHour`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... existing code

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or self._is_holiday(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            if self._is_holiday(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... remaining existing code
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _is_holiday(self, dt):
    return dt.normalize().date() in self.holidays
```

In the corrected `apply` function:
- We added logic to check for holidays and skip over them when adjusting the timestamp according to the business hour.
- The `_is_holiday` method checks if a given date is present in the list of holidays specified for the `CustomBusinessHour`.

By adding this logic, the `apply` function now handles holidays correctly and should produce the expected number of periods in `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours with holidays specified. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
