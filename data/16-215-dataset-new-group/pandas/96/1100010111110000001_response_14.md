The buggy function `apply` in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` has an issue where it fails to correctly adjust business hours based on the given custom business hour. This leads to a ValueError when the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function is executed. 

The failing test is trying to use a custom business hour frequency with one holiday and generate a date range. However, the buggy function `apply` is not correctly applying the custom business hour frequency to the provided start date, which results in the ValueError when the frequency is being validated against the generated range.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the custom business hour frequency is correctly applied when generating the date range. The logic for applying the custom business hour frequency needs to be updated.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        business_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
        business_end = self._get_closing_time(business_start)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                next_business_start = self._next_opening_time(business_end)
                business_end = self._get_closing_time(next_business_start)
                n -= 1
            return business_end
        else:
            while n < 0:
                prev_business_end = business_start - timedelta(seconds=1)
                business_start = self._prev_opening_time(prev_business_end)
                business_end = self._get_closing_time(business_start)
                n += 1
            return business_end
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the custom business hour logic is simplified to properly handle both positive and negative offsets. By directly calculating the next opening time and closing time based on the current business hour, the correct adjusted `other` datetime is returned.

After applying the corrected version, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without raising the ValueError.
