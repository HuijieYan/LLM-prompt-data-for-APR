The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the calculation of business hours, adjustments for business days, and the remaining business hours. The issue arises when using periods and adding holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output.

The root cause of the bug is that the calculation for adjusting business days and remaining business hours is not correctly handling the cases when holidays are included. This leads to incorrect date ranges being generated, as observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours needs to be revised to account for holidays and correctly calculate the number of business hours.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        def adjust_business_days(current_date, n):
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    current_date += timedelta(days=1)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(current_date):
                        while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(current_date):
                            current_date += timedelta(days=1)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    current_date -= timedelta(days=1)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(current_date):
                        while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(current_date):
                            current_date -= timedelta(days=1)
                    n += 1
            return current_date

        if self.holidays:
            current_date = other
            for _ in range(abs(self.n)):
                current_date = adjust_business_days(current_date, n)

            return current_date
        else:
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the `adjust_business_days` function is introduced to handle adjustments for business days while accounting for holidays. This function correctly adjusts the current date based on the number of business days provided.

This revised logic should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report by ensuring that the correct number of periods is generated, even when holidays are included in the calculation.
