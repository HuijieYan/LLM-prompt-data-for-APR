The buggy function is part of a class called `BusinessHourMixin` within a file named `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The class contains several helper functions and the buggy function `apply`. The main issue arises from the failed test case of `_validate_frequency`, which uses a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and attempts to generate a date range based on this frequency. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, which is causing a `ValueError`.

The cause of the failing test is related to the way the `apply` function processes business hours using the provided `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. It appears that the adjustments made within the `apply` function are not taking into account the full range of business hours, and the adjustments made could lead to malformed date ranges that are not compatible with the custom business hours frequency.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug in this case is to re-examine the logic within the `apply` function, particularly the sections that handle adjustments based on positive and negative business hours. The adjustments made for the business days and remaining business hours should be carefully evaluated to ensure they are correctly aligned with the given `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the other datetime to eliminate timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjust the business days based on the business hours
        if n != 0:
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                coerce = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
                other += self.next_bday.apply(coerce * bd)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            end_time = self._get_closing_time(other) if direction == 1 else self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            bhour = (end_time - other) * direction

            if direction * bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain * direction
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour * direction
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour * direction)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the `apply` function adjusts the provided datetime based on the business hour offsets and custom business hours frequency. It ensures that the adjustments made align with the expected behavior of custom business hours. This corrected version should resolve the failing test case.
