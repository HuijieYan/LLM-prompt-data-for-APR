The bug in the provided function seems to be due to incorrect logic in adjusting the business hours when the offset is applied. The function is not properly handling the cases when the offset results in crossing business days or when the remaining time to adjust spans multiple business hours.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business hours needs to be revised, particularly around the handling of business days and remaining business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Assuming all the other functions and classes are imported and defined as per the original code

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other class methods and functions here

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Snap the datetime to the nearest minute
            other = other - timedelta(minutes=other.minute, seconds=other.second, microseconds=other.microsecond)

            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                # Determine the number of business days to skip
                _, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    r = -r
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if r > 0 else self.next_bday.rollback(other)
                other += skip_bd

                # If we land on a weekend or a holiday, adjust to the next business day
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                # Calculate the remaining business hours to adjust
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

                # Adjust the remaining business hours
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n > 0 else other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if (n > 0 and bhour_remain <= bhour) or (n < 0 and bhour_remain < bhour):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n > 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The revised function focuses on snapping the datetime to the nearest minute, adjusting the number of business days to skip, and then adjusting the remaining business hours. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases and fix the bug in the original code.
