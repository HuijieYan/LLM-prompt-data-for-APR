The buggy function is attempting to adjust a given datetime based on a set of business hours, but it is encountering issues when handling edge cases and adjusting for business days and business hours. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the remaining business hours within a day.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Calculation of business hours by seconds in one business day.
2. Calculating the remaining business hours to adjust.
3. The adjustment of business days and the remaining business hours.

The bug is more likely to be caused by miscalculations of business hours and handling of edge cases when adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours.

To fix the bug, I recommend revisiting the logic for calculating business hours, adjusting for business days, and handling edge cases within the function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_seconds = abs(n) * 60 * 60
        adjusted_time = self._adjust_business_hours(other, remaining_seconds, n)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_business_hours(self, dt, remaining_seconds, n):
    current_time = dt.time()
    if n >= 0:
        # Forward adjustment
        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(dt)
        time_left_in_interval = closing_time - datetime.combine(dt.date(), current_time)
        if remaining_seconds < time_left_in_interval.total_seconds():
            return dt + timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
        else:
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(dt + timedelta(seconds=time_left_in_interval.total_seconds()))
            return self._adjust_business_hours(next_opening_time, remaining_seconds - time_left_in_interval.total_seconds(), n)
    else:
        # Backward adjustment
        opening_time = datetime.combine(dt.date(), self._prev_opening_time(dt).time())
        time_left_in_interval = dt - opening_time
        if remaining_seconds <= time_left_in_interval.total_seconds():
            return dt - timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
        else:
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            return self._adjust_business_hours(closing_time, remaining_seconds - time_left_in_interval.total_seconds(), n)
```

In this corrected version, I introduced a new helper method `_adjust_business_hours` to handle the adjustment of remaining business hours. This method takes into account both forward and backward adjustments and properly handles edge cases. There are also some optimizations and simplifications to the logic to ensure correct adjustment of the datetime based on the given business hours.

This corrected version should address the issues encountered in the buggy function by improving the handling of business hours adjustments and edge cases.
