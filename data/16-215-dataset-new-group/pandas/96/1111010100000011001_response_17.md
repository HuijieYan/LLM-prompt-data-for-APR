The buggy function is generating incorrect results due to incorrect logic in its handling of datetime values and adjustments. The main issue is related to the calculations and adjustments made to the input datetime value 'other' based on the property 'n' and the business hour constraints defined in the class. 

The strategy to fix the bug includes:
1. Recheck the logic to adjust the 'other' datetime by number of business days (bd) and remaining business hours (bhour_remain).
2. Ensure the correct handling of negative 'n' values and proper adjustment of the 'other' datetime as per the business hours and business day.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # for simplicity, using the replace method to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust 'other' based on the business hours and business day constraints
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate the total business hours for adjustment
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other
            other += skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Handle remaining business hours adjustment
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the buggy function.
