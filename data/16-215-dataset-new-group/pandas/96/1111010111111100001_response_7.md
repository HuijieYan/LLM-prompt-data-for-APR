## Bug Analysis
The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments to the input datetime. Given the failing test case, it seems that the adjustments from original datetime ("2020-11-25 15:00:00") to the final adjusted datetime ("2020-11-27 16:00:00") are not being calculated correctly.

The buggy code seems to have issues with correctly adjusting the dates based on the given business hours. It fails to properly handle the conditions for both positive and negative values of `n` and struggles to calculate the correct business hours for each situation.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the following actions can be taken:

1. Correct business hours calculation based on the given start and end times.
2. Calculate adjustments on the time intervals based on the input datetime and business hours.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the other datetime based on the business hours
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            # Shift the datetime by business hours
            if n >= 0:
                other += self._get_business_hours(n)
            else:
                other -= self._get_business_hours(-n)

            # Check if the resulting time falls within business hours
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, we are handling the adjustment of business hours and calculating the resulting datetime based on the positive or negative value of `n`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the bug.
