The bug in the `apply` function is causing the test to fail. The buggy function attempts to modify the `other` datetime object based on certain conditionals, but fails to correctly handle all edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

Specifically, the issue seems to be related to business hours being incorrectly calculated when adding holidays. This is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce more than the expected number of periods.

To resolve this bug, we need to carefully check the logic within the `apply` function, especially the parts that handle adjustments to the `other` datetime object. The handling of holidays and business days also needs to be reviewed to ensure correct behavior in all scenarios.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses these issues.

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._get_next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._get_prev_closing_time(other)
        
        business_days = n // self.business_day_len
        remaining_hours = n % self.business_day_len

        other += timedelta(days=business_days)

        hours_for_adjustment = self._get_business_hours_in_interval(other)

        if remaining_hours > 0:
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                if remaining_hours >= hours_for_adjustment:
                    remaining_hours -= hours_for_adjustment
                    other = self._get_next_opening_time(other + timedelta(hours=hours_for_adjustment))
                else:
                    other += timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version of the `apply` function, adjustments to the `other` datetime object are performed based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. This should ensure that the function behaves correctly and produces the expected output when adding holidays.

Once this corrected version of the function is implemented and the tests are rerun, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
