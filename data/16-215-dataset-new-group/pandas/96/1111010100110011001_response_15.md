The function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` has a bug that leads to failing tests. The function takes a `datetime` object as "other", and several other parameters. It performs several time-based operations to calculate the new date and time with considerations for business days and hours. The bug could be located within the complex logic of this function.

The failing tests indicate a `ValueError` raised within a separate class when running a test to validate that the frequency is compatible with the DatetimeIndex, but none of these values are directly present in the function `apply`.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to review the calculations within the `apply` function that manipulates the `datetime` object as well as the other parameters utilized. It may be helpful to add some print statements that could be utilized for debugging or to compare the expected outputs against what the buggy function is returning. 

I will now provide a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reduce nanosecond to zero if present
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # remove timezone information
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)

        if n > 0:
            # choose the next opening time if current time not in business hours or on holidays
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # if current time is in the start time, go to the previous day to find a business day
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)

            # if not in business hours or on holidays, choose the next opening time
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # get the closing time
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours_in_seconds = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # calculate business days and remaining hours
        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_in_seconds // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds

        business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=business_days)

        # increment by the business days
        if business_days != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + business_day_offset + remain
            else:
                other = other + business_day_offset

        remaining_time_offset = timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds)

        # adjusting by remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_time_offset.total_seconds() != 0:
                business_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                time_to_closing = business_closing_time - other
                if remaining_time_offset < time_to_closing:
                    other += remaining_time_offset
                    remaining_time_offset = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time_offset -= time_to_closing
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + time_to_closing)
                    other = next_opening_time
        else:
            while remaining_time_offset.total_seconds() != 0:
                time_to_closing = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_time_offset > time_to_closing or (
                    remaining_time_offset == time_to_closing and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += remaining_time_offset
                    remaining_time_offset = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time_offset -= time_to_closing
                    closing_time_adjusted = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + time_to_closing - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
                    other = closing_time_adjusted

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
