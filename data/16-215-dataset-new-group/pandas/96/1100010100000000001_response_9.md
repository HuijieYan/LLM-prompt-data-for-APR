Upon analyzing the provided buggy function, the potential error locations within the function are as follows:
1. Inconsistent variable names used for comparison, such as `self.end` and `self.start`.
2. Incorrect use of Python classes and functions, such as `Timestamp`, and `BusinessDay`.
3. Incorrect business logic in adjusting the business days and remaining hours for both positive and negative offsets.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles business day offsets and remaining business hours for both positive and negative offsets, leading to incorrect adjustments of the datetime.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to refactor the logic to handle the business day offsets and remaining business hours separately for positive and negative offsets. This will ensure that the adjustments are made correctly according to the business logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessDay, apply_wraps
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        # Business day offset adjustment
        other = self.adjust_business_day_offset(other, n)

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        other = self.adjust_remaining_business_hours(other, nanosecond, n)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def adjust_business_day_offset(self, other, n):
    if n >= 0:
        # For positive offsets
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        # For negative offsets
        if other.time() in self.start:
            # adjustment to move to previous business day
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    return other

def adjust_remaining_business_hours(self, other, nanosecond, n):
    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        other = other + skip_bd

    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        # Business hour left in this business time interval
        if n >= 0:
            # For positive offsets
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
        else:
            # For negative offsets
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
        if (
            bhour_remain > bhour
            or bhour_remain == bhour
            and nanosecond != 0
        ):
            # Finish adjusting if possible
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            # Go to next business time interval
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            if n < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

    return other
```

In the corrected version, the function is split into separate methods to handle the business day offset adjustment and the remaining business hours adjustment, resulting in more manageable and understandable logic for each part of the adjustment process.
