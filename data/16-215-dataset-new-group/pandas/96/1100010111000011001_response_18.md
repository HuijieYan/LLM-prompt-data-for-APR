The bug in the provided function is related to the calculation of business hours when adjusting the datetime for business days and remaining business hours. The correction strategy involves fixing the if conditions and the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours for the given use cases. 

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            while bd != 0:
                if n >= 0 or self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
                else:
                    other -= BusinessDay(n=-bd)
                bd = 0

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            prev_open_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if n >= 0:
                if next_open_time is not None:
                    bhour = min(bhour_remain, next_open_time - other)
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                bhour = (other - prev_open_time) if nanosecond == 0 else (next_open_time - other)
                bhour = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and types for the specified test cases.
