The buggy function `apply` appears to have an error that leads to a failing test case. The function seems to calculate a new datetime value by adjusting the given `other` datetime value based on the `self` and `self.n` input parameters. The error seems to cause an exception in the dtype comparison part of the DatetimeIndex of the test. This is likely due to incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime value within the `apply` function.

The root cause for the bug might be the calculation of the `other` variable when applying adjustments based on the `self.n` condition. It appears that the loop possibly continues indefinitely due to incorrect conditions.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully inspect the adjustment calculation logic within the `apply` function. Specifically, verify how the `datetime` adjustments in both the positive and negative `n` scenarios are being made to avoid conditions leading to an infinite loop and ensure that the proper adjustments are being applied.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), 120)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust the 'other' datetime value based on the number of business days
            other = other + timedelta(days=bd)
            
            # Calculate the additional minutes based on the remaining business hours
            minutes_to_adjust = r
            current_hour = other.hour * 60 + other.minute
            working_hours = list(range(9*60, 17*60))  # Considering 9 AM to 5 PM

            # Update 'other' variable to the nearest working hour
            if self.n >= 0:
                if current_hour > 17*60 or current_hour not in working_hours:
                    next_working_hour = min(filter(lambda x: x > current_hour, working_hours))
                    minutes_to_adjust -= (next_working_hour - current_hour)
                    other = other.replace(hour=next_working_hour//60, minute=next_working_hour%60)
            else:
                if current_hour < 9*60 or current_hour not in working_hours:
                    prev_working_hour = max(filter(lambda x: x < current_hour, working_hours))
                    minutes_to_adjust += (current_hour - prev_working_hour)
                    other = other.replace(hour=prev_working_hour//60, minute=prev_working_hour%60)

            # Update the 'other' variable based on the additional minutes to adjust
            other = other + timedelta(minutes=minutes_to_adjust)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This code should pass the failing test and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable values. It adjusts the `other` datetime variable based on the number of business days and the remaining business hours, ensuring proper working hour adjustments.
