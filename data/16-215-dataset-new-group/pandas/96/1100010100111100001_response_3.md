The bug in the provided function is that the "apply" function does not correctly adjust datetime values when working with CustomBusinessHour offsets. This leads to a ValueError being raised in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly adjusting the datetime values based on the CustomBusinessHour offsets. This leads to incorrect results and the ValueError being raised when the results are compared in the test cases.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to correctly adjust the datetime value based on the CustomBusinessHour offset function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        businesshours = 7200  # Assuming 2 business hours

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.start[0] and other.time() < self.end[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd = abs(n) // businesshours
        r = abs(n) % businesshours
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.rollforward(other) == other:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the ValueError issue in the failing test cases should be resolved.
