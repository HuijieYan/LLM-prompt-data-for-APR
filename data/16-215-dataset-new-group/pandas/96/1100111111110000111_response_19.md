The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is subclassed from `BusinessMixin`. The method applies business hour offsets to a given datetime object. The error occurs when the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays is passed to `pd.date_range()` and creates more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug is a logic error within the `apply` method. It incorrectly assigns the business day offset when calculating the expected output, leading to the unintended generation of more periods for dates. This bug prevents the `pd.date_range` function from behaving as expected.

To fix the bug, we should correct the logic surrounding the application of business day offsets to the given datetime object within the `apply` method. Additionally, the offset application logic should handle the scenario when no holidays are assigned properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other class methods

    # corrected apply method
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # rest of the function remains unchanged as it handles the business day offset calculation

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # avoid overriding the other variable
                adjusted_date = other
                # use the correct method next_bday to check if on offset
                if not self.next_bday(adjusted_date):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_date)
                    remain = adjusted_date - prev_open
                    adjusted_date = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    adjusted_date = adjusted_date + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                # loop for positive n
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_date)) - adjusted_date
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        adjusted_date += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date + bhour)
            else:
                # loop for negative n
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date) - adjusted_date
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        adjusted_date += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_date = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                adjusted_date + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return adjusted_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` method should resolve the issue and pass the failing test while addressing the problem stated in the GitHub issue.
