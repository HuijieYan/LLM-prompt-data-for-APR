The buggy function `apply` in class `BusinessHourMixin` is supposed to adjust the given date and time based on business hours, returning the adjusted datetime. However, the function contains some code errors that prevent it from functioning correctly, resulting in failing the provided test.

The strategy to fix the bug should involve identifying where the logic is not working as intended and making necessary corrections to ensure that the adjusted datetime is correctly calculated based on the business hours. This may involve addressing issues with date comparison, adjustment based on business days, and handling remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday()
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday()
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if self.n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function should now handle edge cases, adjust the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours, and return the adjusted datetime. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
