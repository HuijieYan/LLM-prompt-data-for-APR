Explanation:
The buggy function contains several references to 'self', which should have been replaced with the appropriate object ('this') being passed as a function argument. This is the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, all instances of 'self' in the function should be replaced with 'this' to ensure that the correct object references are being used.

The corrected version of the function now uses 'this' as the object reference throughout the function, addressing the bug and ensuring that the correct object is being accessed.
