The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the pandas library. The function is used to adjust a datetime object by applying a custom business hour offset. The bug causes unexpected results when using `pd.date_range` with a specific frequency, and the buggy behavior is described in the GitHub issue, where adding holidays results in more periods than expected.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the provided business hour offset, as well as the handling of business days and business hours.

The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments made to the provided datetime object based on the defined business hour offset. Additionally, the handling of business days and business hours is not accurate, leading to the unexpected behavior when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic within the `apply` function and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted by the business hour offset. Additionally, the handling of business days and business hours needs to be accurate to avoid the unexpected behavior when used with `pd.date_range`.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to be normalized datetime
        other = as_datetime(other).replace(nanosecond=0)

        # Calculate total business minutes
        business_minutes = 0
        for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
            business_minutes += (end.hour * 60 + end.minute) - (start.hour * 60 + start.minute)

        # Adjust by business days first
        if n != 0:
            remaining_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * business_minutes), 60 * 24)
            if n < 0:
                remaining_days, remaining_minutes = -remaining_days, -remaining_minutes

            if remaining_days != 0:
                other = self.adjust_to_business_day(other, remaining_days)

            # Adjust remaining business minutes
            if remaining_minutes != 0:
                other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                other = self.adjust_to_business_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic has been updated to ensure that the adjustments to the datetime object accurately reflect the defined business hour offset. Additionally, the handling of business days and business hours has been improved to avoid unexpected behavior when used with `pd.date_range`.
