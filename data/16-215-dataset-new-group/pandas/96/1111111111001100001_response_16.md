The bug in the `apply` function is caused by incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object when handling the offset for business hours. This results in incorrect adjustments and a wrong return value. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are in line with the business hours and days, and that the proper calculations are carried out for positive and negative offsets.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        for _ in range(abs(bd)):
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

        remainder = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while remainder != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                business_hour = closing_time - other
                if remainder < business_hour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += remainder
                    remainder = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    remainder -= business_hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour)
            else:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                business_hour = opening_time - other
                if remainder > business_hour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += remainder
                    remainder = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    remainder -= business_hour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function properly handles the adjustments for both positive and negative offsets in the context of business hours and days, and should pass the failing test.
