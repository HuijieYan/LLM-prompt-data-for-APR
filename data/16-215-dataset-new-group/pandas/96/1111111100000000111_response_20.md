The bug in the provided function is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The issue on GitHub has described the problem and its impact on the `date_range` function.

The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and other conditions. The issue on GitHub suggests that when adding holidays, the `date_range` function produces more than the specified number of periods. This aligns with the problem of adjusting the datetime based on holidays in the buggy `apply` function.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `apply` function needs to be corrected to handle holidays properly. It should consider holidays when adjusting the datetime based on business hours. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Identifying holiday logic
        if getattr(other, 'date', None) in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError('Datetime is a holiday')
        
        # remaining logic remains unchanged ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected logic identifies the holiday dates from the `holidays` attribute and raises a TypeError if the datetime falls on a holiday. This prevents the unexpected behavior caused by the buggy adjustment for holidays.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `date_range` function works correctly when using periods and adding holidays.
