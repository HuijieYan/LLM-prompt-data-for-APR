The buggy function seems to have several possible errors related to incorrect calculations and logic, including incorrect variable type usage. The buggy function is also part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and involves working with datetime objects and timedelta for business hour calculations.

Here are the potential errors and causes:
1. The buggy function currently contains logic that seems likely to contain mistakes, including the possibility of incorrect calculations for adjusting datetime objects and the misuse of timedelta and datetime objects.
2. There could be issues with how the function is identifying business days for calculations, and potential issues when adjusting the business hours.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting datetime objects and ensure that timedelta manipulations are being properly tracked.
2. Check for any incorrect calculations for adjusting business days and business hours within the function.

A corrected version of the function:
```python

        return other
