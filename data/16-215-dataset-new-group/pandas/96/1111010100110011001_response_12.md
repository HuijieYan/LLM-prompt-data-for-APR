The identified potential error in the buggy function is a sequence of conditional statements that should be re-evaluated to properly handle the business hour adjustment. The cause of the bug is the failure to appropriately adjust the business hours and calculate the remaining business hours resulting in incorrect datetime values.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to first analyze the conditional statements for adjusting the business hours and working days. Then, calculate the business days and remaining hours based on the given datetime input. After that, adjust the given datetime and calculate the remaining business hours in a more reliable manner.

```python
@apply_wraps

        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust the given datetime based on N
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
