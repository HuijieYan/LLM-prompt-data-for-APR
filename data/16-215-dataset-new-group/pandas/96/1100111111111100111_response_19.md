Looking at the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue arises due to improper handling of the provided holidays when calculating the date range. The failing test demonstrates that when using the `periods` parameter along with the `holidays` parameter in the `pd.date_range` function, the resulting date range includes more than the specified periods.

Based on this observation, it seems that the problem lies within the calculation of the date range, particularly when dealing with the `holidays` parameter.

To fix the bug, the function `apply` needs to be updated to properly handle holidays when calculating the date range. The implementation should ensure that holidays are correctly considered while determining the date range.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        # Add a condition to handle the holidays when calculating the date range
        if len(self.holidays) > 0:
            range_index = pd.date_range(start=other, end=None, periods=self.n, freq=self, holidays=self.holidays)
        else:
            range_index = pd.date_range(start=other, end=None, periods=self.n, freq=self)

        # Return the result, assumed to be the range_index
        return range_index
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, the `apply` function uses the `pd.date_range` function to calculate the date range, considering the provided holidays. This ensures that the date range is accurately determined with respect to the given holidays.

By addressing the handling of holidays when calculating the date range, this corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
