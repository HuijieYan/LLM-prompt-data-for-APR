The buggy function is causing an issue when adding holidays to the frequency in the `pd.date_range` function, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the logic for adjusting the business hours, particularly when handling negative offsets (n < 0).

The bug is likely causing the function to produce unexpected outputs when adding holidays to the frequency in the `pd.date_range` function. It appears that the logic for adjusting business hours is incorrectly handling negative offsets, leading to the incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are added.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that negative offsets and holidays are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # handle negative offsets correctly
        if n < 0:
            # reverse start and end times
            start = self.end
            end = self.start
        else:
            start = self.start
            end = self.end

        # handle the case where other is a business time
        if other.time() in start:
            # adjust for holidays
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and self._is_on_holiday(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(start, end))
            
            # calculate the business days and remaining hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # handle business days adjustment
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if n < 0:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting business hours has been rewritten to handle both positive and negative offsets correctly and to ensure holidays are correctly handled to avoid generating an incorrect number of periods in the `pd.date_range` function.
