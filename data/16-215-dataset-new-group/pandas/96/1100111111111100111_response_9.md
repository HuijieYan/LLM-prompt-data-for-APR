The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The user expects the `pd.date_range` function to work properly when specifying periods and adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency. However, the output contains more than the expected number of periods, indicating incorrect behavior.

### Identified Issue
The buggy function is located within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file and it's called `apply`. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business hours and business days to adjust the input `other` datetime. This results in incorrect output when using periods and adding holidays to generate a date range.

### Root Cause
The root cause of the bug is that the adjustment of the `other` datetime based on the number of business days and business hours is not functioning as expected. This leads to incorrect results when using periods and adding holidays, as observed in the failing test case. 

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours needs to be reviewed and possibly revised. Ensure that the adjustments correctly account for business hours, business days, and holidays to generate the expected date range.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected logic for adjusting the `other` datetime, this function should now generate the correct date range when periods and holidays are used in `pd.date_range`.

By using the corrected version of the function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
