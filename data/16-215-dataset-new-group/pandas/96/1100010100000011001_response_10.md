To fix the buggy function `apply`, we need to update the adjustments made within the function based on the expected return values and types for different input cases. The main issue with the buggy function seems to be incorrect time adjustments. Based on the expected values and types of variables provided for each case, we need to revise the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object, as well as the calculations for `bd`, `r`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour`.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        business_minutes = abs(n * 60)
        bd, r = divmod(business_minutes, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in the current business time interval
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we adjusted the calculation of `bd`, `r`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` based on the provided expected values and types for different input cases. This is expected to address the issues present in the original buggy function and provide the correct output according to the given input parameters.
