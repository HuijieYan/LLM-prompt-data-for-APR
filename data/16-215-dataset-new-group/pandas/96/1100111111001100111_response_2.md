After analyzing the given buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue arises from the calculation of business hours when adding a holiday. The bug causes unexpected results in the generated date range when using custom business hours and adding a holiday.

The cause of the bug is that applying a holiday to a custom business hour causes the frequency to be miscalculated, resulting in an incorrect date range. The incorrect calculations occur when the business hours are adjusted to account for the added holiday, leading to unexpected date range results.

A recommended strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic related to business hours and holidays and ensure that the adjustment for holidays is properly considered in the date range calculation.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        original_other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        adjusted_other, next_bday = adjust_other_to_business_hours(self, other, n)

        business_hours = get_total_business_hours(self)

        bd, r = get_business_day_and_remain(n, business_hours)

        adjusted_other = adjust_by_business_days(adjusted_other, bd, self)

        remaining_business_hour = calculate_remaining_business_hours(n, r, self, adjusted_other)

        return adjusted_other + remaining_business_hour
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic inside the `apply` function as shown above, the bug related to the unexpected behavior when adding a holiday to a custom business hour should be fixed.

Additionally, it's important to include the relevant functions `adjust_other_to_business_hours`, `get_total_business_hours`, `get_business_day_and_remain`, `adjust_by_business_days`, and `calculate_remaining_business_hours` as implemented functions or methods in the same file or module for this corrected version to work properly. These are placeholder function names, and you may need to use actual function names from your implementation.
