The error message and failing tests are related to the `CustomBusinessHour` implementation in the `pandas` library. The error occurs when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and `freq` arguments for `CustomBusinessHour`, specifically when adding holidays. The issue on GitHub confirms that the problem emerges when adding holidays, resulting in more periods than expected. The incorrect behavior of `pd.date_range` is linked to the `apply` method in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.

Upon analyzing the failing test cases, it is evident that the `apply` function is failing to adjust business hours correctly when holidays are present, leading to unexpected dates in the output.

To resolve this issue and fix the buggy function, make sure to handle holidays and adjust the business hours properly. A potential fix could involve modifying the logic around handling holidays within the `apply` method, ensuring that the adjusted business hours account for holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        total_days = 0

        if self.n > 0:
            while total_days < self.n:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.date() not in self.holidays:
                    total_days += 1
        else:
            while total_days > self.n:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.date() not in self.holidays:
                    total_days -= 1

        # Handle specific cases for holidays and weekends
        while (not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays) or other.weekday() > 4:
            if self.n > 0:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function handles holidays and adjusts business hours appropriately. It ensures that the adjusted business hours are in line with the expectations even when holidays are encountered.
