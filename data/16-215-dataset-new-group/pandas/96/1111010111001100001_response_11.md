The buggy function has an issue with adjusting the `other` datetime variable during different conditions, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the adjusted `other` datetime variable based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for the starting time and edge conditions
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjust for the starting time and edge conditions
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n == 0:
            return other

        # Total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining time
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n > 0:
            # Forward adjustment
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Move to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            # Backward adjustment
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                ):
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Move to the previous business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
