The bug in the `apply` function leads to a miscalculation of the business hours when adjusting the given datetime with a business offset. The incorrect calculation results in an unexpected shift in the datetime, leading to an incorrect datetime_index when using `pd.date_range`. This bug appears to be in the logic for adjusting the datetime according to the business hours and the corresponding business days.

The primary cause of the bug involves erroneous logic for adjusting the given datetime based on the business offset's start and end time, business days, and business hours. Despite the presence of numerous functions and methods used within the `apply` function, the logic for adjusting the datetime appears to be the core issue affecting the overall functionality of the `CustomBusinessHour`.

To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the given datetime based on the business offset's start and end time, business days, and business hours must be revised. Additionally, the handling of business days and business hours within the `apply` function needs to be modified to ensure accurate calculation and adjustment of the datetime.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Revised implementation of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other_time = other.time()

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        business_hours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 60

        # Calculate the number of business days to adjust
        business_days, remaining_business_hours = divmod(abs(n), business_hours)

        if self.start[0].hour <= other_time.hour < self.end[0].hour:
            # If the given time is within the business hours, apply adjustments
            if n >= 0:
                # Move to the end of business hours if the given time is not on the offset
                if other_time not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other += timedelta(hours=(self.end[0].hour - other_time.hour))

                # Adjust by the remaining business hours
                if remaining_business_hours != 0:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_business_hours)

            else:
                # Move to the start of business hours if the given time is not on the offset
                if other_time not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= timedelta(hours=(other_time.hour - self.start[0].hour))

                # Adjust by the remaining business hours
                if remaining_business_hours != 0:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_business_hours)

        else:
            # If the given time is outside of business hours, adjust based on business days
            if n > 0:
                # Move to the next business day's opening time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Move to the previous business day's opening time
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # Adjust by the remaining business days
            if business_days != 0:
                other = self.next_bday(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The revised implementation calculates the total business hours in a day and the number of business days to adjust, ensuring correct adjustments of the given datetime based on the specified business offset. The adjustments consider the start and end times of the business offset and handle both positive and negative offset values correctly. Additionally, the logic has been simplified to provide clarity and maintain accuracy in the datetime adjustments.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the correct functioning of the `CustomBusinessHour` with `pd.date_range`.
