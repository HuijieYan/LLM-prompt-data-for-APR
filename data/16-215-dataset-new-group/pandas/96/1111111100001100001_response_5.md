The issue in the given buggy function seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of `other` based on the business hours and business days. The conditions and loops used to adjust the time may not be handling all edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results. 

Based on the provided test cases, it seems that the adjustments for business days and business hours may not be occurring as expected. Additionally, there are some incorrect assignments and comparisons in the function.

To resolve the issue, the following steps can be taken to fix the bug in the provided function:

1. Ensure that the adjustment of `other` to business time is based on the actual business hours defined by "start" and "end" times, and it should handle both positive and negative offsets appropriately.
2. Make sure that the calculation and adjustment of `bhour_remain` and `bhour` are accurate, based on the business hours and the input offset.

Given the above analysis, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function includes adjustments to address potential issues related to the calculation of business days and hours and ensures that the adjustments are correctly applied to the `other` time. This should address the potential bug in the function.
