The bug in the given function is related to the calculation of business hours with `CustomBusinessHour`. The bug causes the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. After analyzing the runtime input/output values and related functions, it's clear that the bug lies in the calculation and adjustment of the business hours.

The potential bug locations are identified within the `apply` function. It's likely that the bug is caused by incorrect calculation and adjustment of the business hours, leading to incorrect results and subsequently failing the test.

The cause of the bug is likely to be incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours which results in incorrect datetime calculations.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to review and rewrite the part of the function that handles the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, the condition checks and loops need to be carefully analyzed to ensure the correct adjustment of business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import required module
import numpy as np

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The buggy function that needs to be fixed
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )
    
    n = self.n
    total_minutes = n * 60
    
    # Calculate the number of business days to adjust
    business_days_to_adjust, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(total_minutes), businesshours // 60)
    business_days_to_adjust = -business_days_to_adjust if n < 0 else business_days_to_adjust
    
    if business_days_to_adjust != 0:
        other = other + pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=business_days_to_adjust)
    
    if remaining_minutes != 0:
        curr_dt = other
        direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
        
        while remaining_minutes != 0:
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(curr_dt, sign=direction)
            delta_to_next_open = next_opening_time - curr_dt
            business_hour_diff = delta_to_next_open if direction > 0 else -delta_to_next_open
            
            if abs(business_hour_diff.total_seconds()) <= abs(remaining_minutes) * 60:
                remaining_minutes -= 1
                curr_dt = next_opening_time
            else:
                if direction > 0:
                    curr_dt += pd.Timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                else:
                    curr_dt -= pd.Timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                remaining_minutes = 0
    
    return curr_dt
```

In the corrected function, I adjusted the business days and remaining business hours based on the sign of `n` and applied the correct adjustments for the business hours. Additionally, the function uses the pandas `Timedelta` to properly handle the adjustments.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
