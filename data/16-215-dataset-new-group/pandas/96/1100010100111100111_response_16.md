The buggy function seems to be causing `ValueError` when a custom frequency is provided to `pd.date_range` that includes periods and holidays. The issue on GitHub points this out as well, stating that adding holidays to the custom frequency results in more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` when handling holidays. The function does not properly skip the holiday and creates more periods than expected, resulting in a `ValueError`.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly handling the holidays and ensuring that the correct number of periods is generated when holidays are added to the custom frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle holidays
        if hasattr(self, "holidays") and self.holidays is not None:
            holidays = set(self.holidays)
            if other in holidays:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Datetime matches a holiday")

        n = self.n

        # the rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ... (rest of the function)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle holidays. If the `CustomBusinessHour` has holidays defined and if the input datetime matches a holiday, it raises an error. This prevents the date range generation from creating more periods than expected when holidays are involved. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
