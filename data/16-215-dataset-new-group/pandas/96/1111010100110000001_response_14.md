The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is due to potential errors in date and time calculations, as well as checks for specific conditions such as business days and business time intervals. The error message received from the failing test indicates a mismatch between inferred frequency and passed frequency, specifically within the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

To fix this bug, we can consider revisiting the logic for adjusting dates and times, as well as reviewing the conditional checks for business days and time intervals. Additionally, thorough testing and validation of each adjustment step within the function may be necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Normalize the time
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n
            current_time = other.time()

            if n >= 0:
                if current_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if current_time in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the conditional logic and rearranged the date and time adjustment steps. Additionally, we ensured that the time is normalized for consistency. This revised approach aims to address potential errors in date and time calculations and help resolve the issue related to inferred and passed frequencies.
