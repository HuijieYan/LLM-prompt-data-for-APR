The bug in the function is likely due to improper adjustment of the "other" datetime object in the specific conditions when "n" is non-negative. The adjustment logic for "other" based on the conditions is likely leading to incorrect results, causing the failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic for adjusting the "other" datetime object in the respective conditions and ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly based on the condition checks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import necessary packages
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay

# ...

# Fix the buggy function
class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):
    # Other methods from the class

    # Corrected apply method
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust for n >= 0
            if n >= 0:
                # Adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
                other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            # Adjust for n < 0
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - pd.Timedelta(1, unit='s')
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function now properly adjusts the "other" datetime object based on the conditions and should pass the failing tests.
