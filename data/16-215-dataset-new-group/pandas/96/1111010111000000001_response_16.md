The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class appears to be responsible for adjusting dates based on business hours. It has a problem with handling dates that fall on holidays or weekends, resulting in incorrect adjustments and failing the test.

The bug seems to be in the logic for adjusting the input date based on business hours and handling holidays. This is likely causing the incorrect results observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to review and potentially revise the logic for adjusting the input date, taking into account holidays and weekends to ensure the correct output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):

        # Handling for holidays and weekends
        modified_other = self.rollforward(other) 

        return modified_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I've added a call to the `rollforward` method to handle holidays and weekends appropriately. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
