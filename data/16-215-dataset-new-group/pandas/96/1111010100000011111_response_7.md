The buggy function `apply` has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The handling of timezones and nanoseconds is incorrect.
2. The logic for adjusting business days and business hours is incorrect.
3. The return value of the function is not being formed correctly.

The issues mentioned in the GitHub post are related to using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays. While the exact cause of the problem may not be clear from the issue description, it is likely that the issues in the `apply` function are causing unexpected behavior when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bugs in the `apply` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Correct the handling of timezones and nanoseconds within the `if isinstance(other, datetime):` block.
2. Review and update the logic for adjusting business days and business hours to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
3. Verify that the return value is being formed correctly and matches the expected behavior for custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Note: The corrected function assumes that the underlying logic of the class methods such as `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_get_business_hours_by_sec` are implemented correctly and are providing the expected behavior.
