The bug in the `apply` function is causing a ValueError when the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test is executed. The function is supposed to apply a custom business offset to a given datetime, but it fails due to improper handling of the offset calculations and adjustments.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect offset calculations and adjustments for custom business hours. When the `other` value is adjusted based on the custom business hours, the application logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect outputs. 

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` value based on the business hours and business days needs to be reviewed and corrected. This involves ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly for both positive and negative offsets, and that the `other` value is being aligned with the custom business hours in a proper manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function incorporating the necessary fixes:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods remain unchanged

    # corrected version of apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            adjusted_datetime = other
            n = self.n

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    # move forward in time, check for start/end of business hours
                    if adjusted_datetime.hour >= self.end.hour or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                        adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                else:
                    # move backward in time, check for start/end of business hours
                    if adjusted_datetime.hour < self.start.hour or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                        adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                        adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

                # move by one business hour
                adjusted_datetime += pd.Timedelta('1H') if n > 0 else pd.Timedelta('-1H')
                business_day = adjusted_datetime.dayofweek < 5
                if business_day:
                    n -= 1

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function ensures that the adjustments for the custom business hours and business days are made correctly, addressing the issues in the buggy implementation.
