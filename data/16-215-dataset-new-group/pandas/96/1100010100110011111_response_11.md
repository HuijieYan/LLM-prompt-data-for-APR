## Strategy for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the validation of the frequency when using `date_range` with a CustomBusinessHour offset and adding holidays. The bug is likely in the `apply` function, as it seems to be responsible for applying the custom business hour offset while accounting for holidays. 

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly handle the case where holidays are added to the custom business hour offset. This modification should ensure that the offset is correctly applied without producing unexpected results, such as extra periods in the resulting date range.

## Corrected version of the function

The updated `apply` function is provided below:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the date is a holiday and handle accordingly
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError(f"{other.date()} is a holiday")
        
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ... (existing code)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `apply` function now checks if the date is a holiday and raises a `ApplyTypeError` if it is. This modification ensures that the custom business hour offset is not applied when the date is a holiday.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and enable the `date_range` function to work properly with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and holidays.
