The potential location of the bug is identified in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `offsets.py` file. The function is responsible for applying the CustomBusinessHour offset to a given datetime object, and it seems the bug is causing unexpected changes in the output when holidays are added.

The bug appears to be related to the way the `CustomBusinessHour` offset is applied when holidays are provided. It seems that the function does not handle holidays properly when calculating the datetime periods, leading to incorrect outputs when holidays are included.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class should be modified to accurately handle holidays and adjust the datetime periods accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle holidays
        if getattr(self, 'holidays', None):
            other = self._skip_holidays(other)

        # rest of the code for applying the CustomBusinessHour offset
        # ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to check for holidays and skip them using the `_skip_holidays` method before proceeding with the rest of the code for applying the CustomBusinessHour offset.

This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue by ensuring that the `apply` method handles holidays correctly and produces the expected output when using periods and adding holidays with `pd.date_range`.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add test cases for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays to the pandas test suite to prevent similar issues in the future.
