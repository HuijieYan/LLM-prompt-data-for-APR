To fix the bug in the given function, it is essential to focus on the potential error locations within the code. After analyzing the function and its related functions, it seems like there are several issues that might be causing the bug.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect usage of the `is_on_offset` function - The buggy function appears to incorrectly call the `is_on_offset` function without referencing the class it belongs to.
2. Use of `self.next_bday` instead of `self.next_bday()` - The code uses `self.next_bday` as a function, but it should be invoked as `self.next_bday()`.
3. Incorrect reference to class attributes - There may be errors in referencing class attributes, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `is_on_offset` function is utilized within the `apply` function. Additionally, the inconsistency in using class attributes and functions might also contribute to the bug.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to:
1. Ensure that the `is_on_offset` function is correctly called by referencing the class it belongs to.
2. Correctly invoke the `self.next_bday()` function and ensure that all other class attributes and functions are referenced correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# corrected apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (... existing code ...)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd.apply() + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd.apply()

        # (... remaining code ...)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, I've made the following changes:
1. Adjusted the reference to the `is_on_offset` function by using `self.is_on_offset` instead of simply `is_on_offset`.
2. Corrected the invocation of the `skip_bd` function by using `skip_bd.apply()`.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly utilize the related functions and class attributes, potentially fixing the bug.
