The buggy function is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on whether it falls within a business day. It checks if the input datetime is within the business hours, and if not, it adjusts it to the next available business time interval. The function uses the given business hours to calculate the adjustment.

The potential error locations lie in the calculation involving business hours, the adjustment of the input datetime to fit within business hours, and the return of the adjusted datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the function is failing to correctly adjust the input datetime by business days and remaining business hours.

The strategy for fixing the bug will involve debugging the function to ensure that:
1. It correctly calculates the remaining business hours and adjusts the datetime to fit within business hours if necessary.
2. Both cases for positive and negative values of 'n' (the number of business days to adjust by) are met.
3. The return value matches the expected output based on the input provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def fix_apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to be the raw date
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self.businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            # adjust by business days first
            other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + bd * BDay()

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                temp_time = other + bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            elif n > 0 and other.time() in self.end:
                other = self.next_bday.forward(other)
            elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
                other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
            else:
                temp_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

            business_interval_end = self._get_closing_time(
                _roll_yearday(temp_time, other)
            )
            bhour_remain = business_interval_end - temp_time
            other = temp_time

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
Please note that there could be additional bugs outside of the provided failing test cases. The corrected function aims to satisfy all the provided test cases based on the expected input/output values.
