Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        new_date = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if new_date.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
        else:
            if new_date.time() in self.start:
                new_date -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                new_date = self._get_closing_time(new_date)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(new_date):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(new_date)
                remain = new_date - prev_open
                new_date = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                new_date = new_date + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_date)) - new_date
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    new_date += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(new_date) - new_date
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                ):
                    new_date += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    new_date = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(new_date + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return new_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the main issue was variable name conflicts and incorrect assignment of the output variable `other`. The function logic has been fixed to correctly adjust the timestamp and handle edge conditions, as outlined in the expected variable values and types from the failing test cases.
