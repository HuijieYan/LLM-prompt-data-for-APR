### Analysis
The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is failing to correctly adjust business hours, resulting in incorrect output for the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays.

The GitHub issue #30593 describes a similar use case where `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays produces more than the expected number of periods. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates this issue.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function is adjusting business hours and handling holidays, ultimately resulting in an incorrect calculation of the number of periods in `date_range`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `apply` function to correctly handle business hours and holidays when adjusting dates. Specifically, the adjustment logic for moving to the next business day or business time interval needs to be reviewed and corrected.

### Bug Fix
```python
from datetime import time

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while other.time() not in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        # ... (remaining code)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the fix, we've added checks to handle holidays when adjusting the `other` datetime. If the `other` date falls on a holiday, it should be appropriately adjusted to the next business day or business time interval.

This fix should ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles holidays and calculates the adjusted business hours, resolving the issue observed in the failing test and described in the GitHub issue.
