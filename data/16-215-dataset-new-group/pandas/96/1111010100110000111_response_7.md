Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem lies within the application of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The issue arises specifically when using the `periods` argument, and it results in unexpected behavior when holidays are introduced. 

Looking at the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, there are multiple areas that could potentially cause the problem. In particular, the adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable based on the conditions related to `n` and `businesshours` might be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the calculations involved in adjusting the datetime based on the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and its interaction with holidays. The function is not correctly handling the adjustments needed when holidays are present, leading to incorrect periods being generated by the `date_range`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the adjustments made within the `apply` function correctly account for holidays and business hours to generate the expected periods in a `date_range`. Additionally, the logic involving the adjustments based on `n` and `businesshours` needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to accommodate the presence of holidays and ensure accurate datetime adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            start_time = self.start[0]
            end_time = self.end[-1]

            # Check for holidays and skip them
            if other in self.holidays:
                _, other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Adjust to business hours
                date_time = other.replace(hour=start_time.hour, minute=start_time.minute)

                if other < date_time:
                    other = date_time
                elif other > self._get_closing_time(other):
                    start_shift = shift_month(date_time, n=1)
                    other = start_shift.replace(hour=start_time.hour, minute=start_time.minute)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected version addresses the potential issues by incorporating proper handling of holidays and business hours adjustments, ensuring that the datetime `other` will align accurately with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. After the correction, the `date_range` should work as expected, even when a holiday is introduced.
