Looking at the code and the failing test, it seems the bug is related to the calculation of the next business day and the adjustment of the time. The issue may be happening in the block of code that tries to adjust "other" based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

The buggy function is trying to adjust the input date and time based on the business hours, and it seems to be encountering issues when determining the next business day and remaining business hours for negative values of "n".

The strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the logic for adjusting the input date and time, especially when "n" is a negative number. It may involve reconsidering how the adjustments are made in that scenario and ensuring that the adjustments are calculated correctly based on the business hours and the specified time intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import the necessary library
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Function to fix the bug
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1

        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjust to move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the input date and time has been redesigned to handle both positive and negative values of "n" correctly. The adjustments are made by iterating over the number of business days and ensuring that the date and time are adjusted accordingly.

Please thoroughly test this corrected version on the failing test and other relevant scenarios to ensure that it effectively addresses the bug.
