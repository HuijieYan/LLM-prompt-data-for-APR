The cause of the bug:
The buggy function has multiple conditional checks and adjustments to the input `other` datetime object while considering `self.n` and business hours to calculate the next opening time, closing time, and number of business days, to adjust the time by business days and remaining business hours. The conditionals and adjustments seem to be leading to inaccurate results, causing unexpected behavior in the `apply` function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the conditional checks and adjustments in the `apply` function need to be thoroughly reviewed and updated to ensure accurate adjustments of the input `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours and business days.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust by remaining business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The corrected version of the `apply` function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
