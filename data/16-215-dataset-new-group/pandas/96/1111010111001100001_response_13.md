Looking at the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the logic for adjusting the business hours in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is intended to adjust a given timestamp according to the business hours defined by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function are in the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters `self.n`, `businesshours`, `bd`, and `bhour_remain`. There are also conditional statements that check the business hours to see if further adjustments are needed.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters may not be correctly handling all cases, leading to incorrect output timestamps.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for adjusting the business hours in the `apply` function by carefully considering the cases when `n` is positive and negative, and how to properly adjust the timestamp based on the business hours defined by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjustment for positive n
            adjusted_time = other
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(hours=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time) or adjusted_time.time() in self.end:
                    n -= 1
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            # Adjustment for negative n
            adjusted_time = other
            n *= -1  # Convert n to positive for simplicity
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time) or adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                    n -= 1
            return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function simplifies the logic for adjusting the business hours and uses a while loop to handle positive and negative `n` values. This should address the issues with the original function and make it pass the failing test.
