### Correction strategy:
1. Inspect the code for potential issues in handling holidays and business hours.
2. Ensure that the proper date range is created when using both periods and holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
3. Update the `apply` function to apply the correct business hours when calculating the date range, accounting for holidays.

### Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # track nanosecond
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            delta = self.n * self.get_diff_in_minutes(self.start, self.end)
            if delta < 0:
                delta = -(-delta // self.frequency.delta)
            else:
                delta = delta // self.frequency.delta

            printing_time = other

            while delta != 0:
                # moving to next business time interval
                printing_time += timedelta(minutes=self.frequency.delta)
                if self.n < 0 and printing_time.time() >= self.end[0]:
                    break
                elif self.n >= 0 and printing_time.time() >= self.start[0]:
                    break
                delta -= 1
            return printing_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected `apply` function ensures that the correct business hours are applied when calculating the date range. It also accounts for holidays and adjusts the date range accordingly.

This corrected code should address the issue where the `pd.date_range` function was not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays.
