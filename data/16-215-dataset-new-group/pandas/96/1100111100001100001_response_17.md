The buggy function appears to be an implementation of business hours that adjusts a given timestamp according to a set of custom business hours. From the runtime input/output values, we can observe that the function takes a timestamp `other` and a business hour `self` as input and returns a adjusted timestamp.

The buggy function has several potential error locations, but the root cause of the bug seems to be the logic for adjusting the input timestamp `other` based on the business hours defined in `self`. The variable calculations and conditional logic inside the function do not consistently handle adjusting the timestamp according to the business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic for adjusting the input timestamp, ensuring that it accurately accounts for the business hours specified in the `self` object.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the input timestamp has been revised to accurately handle the business hours defined in the `self` object. This includes proper handling of the opening and closing times for adjustment, as well as the conditional logic for adjusting based on the value of `n`.

By correcting the logic for adjusting the timestamp according to the business hours, the bug in the original function should be resolved.
