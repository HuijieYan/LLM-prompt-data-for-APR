The buggy function `apply` seems to have problems with date and time manipulation. The logic seems faulty as it's not producing the expected output with the given inputs.

The potential errors in the buggy function are:
- Incorrect timezone and nanosecond reset for 'other' datetime.
- Failure to adjust 'other' to reduce the number of cases to handle.
- Incorrect calculation of business hours and business days.
- Issues with the adjustment to move to the previous business day.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves addressing the issues one by one, starting with:
1. Correctly resetting the timezone and nanosecond in the 'other' datetime.
2. Accurately adjusting 'other' to reduce the number of cases to handle.
3. Fixing the calculation of business hours and business days.
4. Correcting the adjustment to move to the previous business day.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, ns=0)
        
        n = self.n
        other_time = other.time()
        total_business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other_time in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # adjusting based on business days and remaining business hours
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

        if bd != 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 \
                    else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if (bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0) and n < 0):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please integrate this corrected version of the `apply` function and re-run the failing test to verify its correctness.
