The bug in the `apply` function causes unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. It leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated. The issue on GitHub has provided a detailed description of the problem, outlining how `pd.date_range` produces more than 14 periods when holidays are added.

The cause of the bug in the `apply` function appears to be the incorrect computation of business hours and the adjustment of the input datetime. This leads to incorrect results when generating the periods in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for computing business hours and adjusting the input datetime to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # adjust to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                if other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                prev_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(prev_closing_time)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first, using skip_bd if necessary
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if r != 0:
            remaining_minutes = abs(n * 60) % businesshours
            end_of_day = self.start[-1] if self.start < self.end else self.end[-1]
            if n >= 0:
                business_minutes_to_end_of_day = ((end_of_day.hour * 60 + end_of_day.minute) - (other.hour * 60 + other.minute))
            else:
                business_minutes_to_end_of_day = (other.hour * 60 + other.minute) - (end_of_day.hour * 60 + end_of_day.minute)

            if business_minutes_to_end_of_day >= remaining_minutes:
                # adjusting the time within the same business day
                other = other + pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)
            else:
                # adjusting the time to the next business day
                remaining_minutes -= business_minutes_to_end_of_day
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + pd.Timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes))

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version, the computation of business hours and the adjustment of the input datetime have been adjusted to ensure the correct number of periods is generated in the `pd.date_range` function.
