The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is designed to calculate the datetime based on business hours. It has several potential error locations, including the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime, calculations of `bd` and `r`, the adjustment of business days, and the adjustment of remaining business hours.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments to the input datetime `other` and the erroneous handling of business days and remaining hours. Specifically, the `bd` and `r` values are not being calculated correctly, which leads to incorrect adjustments and an incorrect return value.

A strategy to fix the bug in the `apply` function would be to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime `other`, re-calculate the values for `bd` and `r` based on the business hours, and ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining hours are accurate.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, adjustments to the input `other` datetime have been revised, the calculations for `bd` and `r` have been adjusted, and the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours has been updated to ensure accurate calculations. Additionally, I've used pandas offsets for handling business days, as it seems that the original code was designed to work with pandas Timestamp and offsets.

It's important to note that I've made some assumptions in the missing function calls `self._is_on_offset`, `self._next_opening_time`, `self._get_closing_time`, and `self._get_business_hours_by_sec`, so you will have to implement these functions based on the actual logic and requirements of your application.
