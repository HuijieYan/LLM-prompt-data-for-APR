The buggy function attempts to apply a business hour shift to a given datetime object. It adjusts the provided datetime object based on certain conditions and then adds the business hour shift to it. The affected test uses a custom business hour with a specific start time and a holiday.

The function fails to correctly apply the business hour shift in the presence of a holiday, resulting in a ValueError.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the calculation of the business day and remaining business hours, especially when handling negative shifts and edge cases. It also appears that the logic is overly complicated, leading to errors in handling the input.

To fix the bug, I suggest simplifying the logic for adjusting the business hour shift and handling holidays. The function should accurately account for holidays and handle both positive and negative shifts, ensuring that the adjusted datetime object aligns with the specified business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for holidays and start time
            while other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other, start=True):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
            # Adjust for remaining business hours
            remaining_hours = (n * 60) % 120
            other += timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
        else:
            # Check if the given datetime is a holiday
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
            # Adjust for start and end time
            while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other, start=False):
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            # Adjust for remaining negative business hours
            remaining_hours = (n * 60) % 120
            other -= timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the business hour shift is simplified and updated to accurately handle both positive and negative shifts, including holiday checks.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without raising any errors.
