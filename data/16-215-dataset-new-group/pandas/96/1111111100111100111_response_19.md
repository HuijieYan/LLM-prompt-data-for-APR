The cause of the bug is likely within the `apply` function due to incorrect handling of the condition where the business hours are continued over various days, potentially leading to incorrect adjustment of the dates. This bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle scenarios where the business hours cross over different days.

Given the information and cases provided, the corrected version of the `apply` function can be implemented as follows:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n < 0:
                target_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    target_time -= timedelta(days=1)
                other = target_time
            else:
                target_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
                if other.time() >= self.end[0]:
                    target_time += timedelta(days=1)
                other = target_time

            business_day = CustomBusinessDay(n=n, start=self.start[0], weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0], weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)

            result_time = business_hour.apply(business_day.apply(other))
            
            return datetime.combine(other.date(), result_time.time())
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic has been adjusted to correctly handle the scenarios where the business hours extend over different days. Additionally, separate instances of `CustomBusinessDay` and `CustomBusinessHour` classes have been instantiated for accurate calculations.

By using this corrected code, the issue reported in the GitHub post is expected to be resolved. This will ensure that the `date_range` function works as intended when using periods and adding holidays, providing the expected output.
