The buggy function is intended to adjust a given date/time value based on a business day offset. However, there are multiple potential issues with the code, such as:
- Incorrect usage of datetime function - the `datetime` function is called without considering timezone and nanosecond which may lead to inaccurate results.
- Issues with the adjustment logic - there are multiple if-else conditions and variable manipulations, making it complicated to determine if all business cases are covered and handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should be redesigned with an improved logic for adjusting the date/time based on the business day offset to ensure that it produces the expected results in all scenarios.

Below is a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            total_seconds = n * 60 * 60
            business_days, remainder_seconds = divmod(abs(total_seconds), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remainder_seconds = -business_days, -remainder_seconds

            adjusted_datetime = other + timedelta(days=business_days)
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            adjusted_datetime += timedelta(seconds=remainder_seconds)

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, the function adds the business days first and then adjusts the remaining hours separately, simplifying the logic and making it easier to ensure correctness. This approach is more readable and should better handle all cases.

The corrected function should satisfy all the expected input/output values in the test cases provided.
