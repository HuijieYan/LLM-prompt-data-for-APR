The buggy function is a method named `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is defined within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This `apply` method is a member of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and should apply the business hour offset (specifically defined by the object it is invoked on) to a given datetime. The related functions required for the successful execution of this method are defined within the same file in different classes as helper methods. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message is indicating that there is a ValueError occurring during frequency validation.

Looking at the code of the `apply` method, it seems that the main issue may be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hour offsets. The complex nature of these calculations, conditionals, and adjustments can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly during edge cases or with certain configurations.

To fix the bug, it's important to thoroughly validate the logic for adjusting the business hour offset and ensure that it correctly handles all scenarios. Also, check the handling of the input datetime when applying the business hour offset. It might be necessary to review the calculations and conditions to improve their accuracy.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Get the time portion
            time_only = other.time()

            # Adjust the time to working hours
            if time_only < self.start:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start)
            elif time_only >= self.end:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date() + timedelta(days=1), self.start)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the business hour offset and ensures that the input datetime is adjusted to the relevant working hours. This should address the issue and allow the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to pass.
