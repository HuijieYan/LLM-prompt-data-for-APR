From the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it can be observed that the function is not correctly handling the business hours and adjusting the datetime accordingly. The adjustments based on business days and business hours are not being performed accurately.

The issue with the function is that it fails to correctly process the business hours and days and does not adjust the datetime accordingly. This results in incorrect output datetime values, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to accurately calculate the business hours and days, and adjust the datetime based on these calculations, ensuring that the adjustments are correctly applied.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):    
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening_time
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = next_opening_time - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening_time)
        else:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = next_opening_time - other
                if r > bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments based on business hours and days are accurately calculated and applied to the datetime. This should address the issues and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
