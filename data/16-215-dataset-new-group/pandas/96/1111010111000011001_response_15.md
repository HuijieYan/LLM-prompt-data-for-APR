The buggy function 'apply' has several issues. It tries to modify the 'datetime' object in place in several places, resulting in undesired time changes. The 'bd' variable is erroneously defined due to incorrect calculation involving timedelta objects, leading to incorrect results. Another issue is that the 'bd' is being used to handle business days adjustment, which is not necessary. We need to identify the actual business day for the given date adjustment.

Also, the 'bhour_remain' variable is not adjusted correctly using timedelta objects. The loop conditions for adjustment in the while loop are not correct for future or past adjustments. The 'if' condition in the loop also compares timedelta object with zero, whereas it should be comparing with the number of seconds.

To fix the buggy function, the following changes need to be implemented:
- Instead of modifying 'other' directly, a new 'adjusted_time' variable should be used to hold the adjusted 'other' datetime object.
- The 'bd' should be recalculated using the proper formula involving timedelta. Also, the calculation for future and past business days should be corrected.
- Adjust the 'bhour_remain' by addition or subtraction with new timedelta objects depending on whether we are adding hours or subtracting from them. Also correct the while loop conditions to accurately check for the adjustment of remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the 'apply' function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Create a new variable to store the adjusted time
        adjusted_time = other
        start_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start_time)
        end_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end_time)
        n = self.n
          
        # Business days adjustment
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= end_time.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate business hours by sec
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate adjusted time based on business days
        if n != 0:
            # Calculate business days and remaining hours
            total_seconds = abs(n * 60) * 60
            business_hours_in_seconds = businesshours * 60
            remaining_seconds = total_seconds % business_hours_in_seconds
            bd = total_seconds // business_hours_in_seconds
            if n < 0:
                bd, remaining_seconds = -bd, -remaining_seconds
            
            # Adjust the remainder of business hours
            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = end_time - adjusted_time
                else:
                    bhour = adjusted_time - start_time
                    
                if remaining_timedelta < bhour:
                    adjusted_time += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_timedelta -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    else:
                        adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
        
            # Adjust the adjusted time by business days difference
            if bd != 0:
                adjusted_time += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
