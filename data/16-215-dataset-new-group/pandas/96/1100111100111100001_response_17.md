The key issue with the provided function is that it does not consider the offset function properly and fails to handle multiple cases effectively. Additionally, the logic for adjusting business days and business hours has several bugs.

The following points identify potential issues within the buggy function:
1. The `is_on_offset` method is called within the function but is not defined for the current class.
2. The logic for handling positive and negative business days is incorrect.
3. The approach for adjusting business hours is overly complex and prone to errors.

To fix the bug, the following strategies can be used:
1. Ensure that the necessary methods like `is_on_offset` are defined and called properly.
2. Simplify the logic for adjusting business days and hours.
3. Add proper error handling and validation to handle the different cases effectively.

Here's the corrected implementation of the function:

```python
# other code...

# fix the original buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # convert to datetime and reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.to_pydatetime().replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            # handle the case for positive and negative business days
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    elif other.time() > self.end[0]:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated function simplifies the logic for adjusting business days and hours and ensures proper handling of different cases.

After implementing the corrected function, it should be tested again to ensure that it now passes the failing test cases from before. If there are still issues, further adjustments may be necessary.
