The cause of the bug is that the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is not properly handling the addition of holidays when used with `pd.date_range`. This is resulting in the output containing more periods than expected.

The issue arises from the `apply` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class which is located in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The method is not correctly adjusting the dates when holidays are present, leading to an incorrect result when generating date ranges.

To fix this bug, the `apply` method needs to be modified to properly handle the addition of holidays when adjusting dates.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            other = self._apply_business_day_logic(other)
            n -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _apply_business_day_logic(self, other):
    if self._is_on_offset(other):
        return other

    if self._is_before_start(other):
        return self._apply_before_start_logic(other)
    else:
        return self._apply_after_start_logic(other)

def _apply_before_start_logic(self, other):
    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)

    if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
        return prev_open + BusinessHour(n=self.n)

    remain = other - prev_open
    return prev_open + BusinessDay(n=-1) + remain

def _apply_after_start_logic(self, other):
    prev_close = self._prev_closing_time(other)

    if self._is_on_offset(prev_close):
        return prev_close + BusinessHour(n=self.n)

    remain = other - prev_close
    return self._next_opening_time(prev_close) + remain
```

With this updated `apply` method, the logic for adjusting dates based on the presence of holidays and hours is corrected.

This corrected version of the `apply` method should resolve the bug and allow `pd.date_range` to work correctly when using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays.
