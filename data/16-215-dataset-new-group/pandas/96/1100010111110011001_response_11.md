The buggy function `apply` is part of the pandas library and is called by the failing test. The specific test is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` functionality, and the failing test is due to an unhandled exception caused by the incorrect date and time adjustments inside the `apply` function. The bug is probably caused by an incorrect business hour adjustment when handling next or previous business day scenarios. To fix the bug, we can revise the business hour calculations and adjustments related to `other` variable and adjust the code accordingly.

Based on the failing test presented, we have been given 46 different expected cases with various inputs and expected outputs for the `apply` function. Taking each of these cases into consideration, the cause of the failure is most likely due to incorrect business hour calculation and adjustments within the `apply` function.

The outputs from these cases indicate that the dates are not being correctly adjusted when applying offsets. To fix the issue, the logic in the calculation and adjustment of business hours may need to be revisited and adjusted correspondingly. We can also add some additional test coverage specific to the failing tests provided to ensure that the new code is working as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should pass the failing tests:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hour_start = min(self.start)
        business_hour_end = max(self.end)

        is_after_business_hours = other.time() > business_hour_end
        is_before_business_hours = other.time() < business_hour_start

        # check if other falls within the business hours
        if is_after_business_hours or is_before_business_hours:
            if n >= 0:
                other_date = other.date() + timedelta(days=1)
                other_date = datetime.combine(other_date, business_hour_start)
                return other_date
            else:
                return datetime.combine(other.date(), business_hour_end)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours / 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            bd_offset = self.apply(BDay(n=bd))

            next_or_prev_opening_time = self._next_opening_time if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time
            bhour = next_or_prev_opening_time(other) - other if n < 0 else self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            adjustment = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if adjustment < bhour:
                other += adjustment
            else:
                other = next_or_prev_opening_time(other + bhour + adjustment)
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the provided corrected version of the function apply, business hours are adjusted by division to obtain whole business days and remainder business hours. This allows for accurate business hour calculations and adjustments. The function includes additional adjustments for before/after business hours scenarios, and addresses potential edge cases.

Additionally, for validation purposes, you can also add more test cases with different inputs that cover different conditions in the function's logic.

The corrected code should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
