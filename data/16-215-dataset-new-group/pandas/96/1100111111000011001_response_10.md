The buggy function is failing the test case. The code needs to be re-structured to handle the datetime calculation properly for the given business hours.

To fix the bug, the code for the `apply` function needs to be refactored. The approach would be to:
1. Update the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours and handle negative offsets properly.
2. Ensure that the adjusted datetime values align with the expected business hours.

A possible corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessHour):
    # Custom implementation of CustomBusinessHour

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other_date = datetime.combine(other.date(), datetime.min.time())

            # Define business hours
            business_hour_open = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start) 
            business_hour_close = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end) 

            if n >= 0:
                # Handle positive offsets
                if other_time <= business_hour_open or not self.is_on_offset(other_date):
                    other_date = business_hour_open

                while n > 0:
                    other_date = other_date + timedelta(hours=1)
                    if other_date >= business_hour_close:
                        other_date = business_hour_open
                        n -= 1
            else:
                # Handle negative offsets
                if other_date >= business_hour_close:
                    other_date = business_hour_close - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self.is_on_offset(other_date):
                    other_date = business_hour_open

                while n < 0:
                    other_date = other_date - timedelta(hours=1)
                    if other_date < business_hour_open:
                        other_date = business_hour_close - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        n += 1

            return other_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function is designed to handle the adjustments required for the provided business hours and offsets. This refactored code is expected to fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
