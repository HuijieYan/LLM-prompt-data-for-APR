The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of business hours when applying custom offsets. Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is not correctly accounting for the specified holidays when calculating the number of periods. This results in an incorrect number of periods being returned in the date range output.

The strategy to fix this bug would be to modify the logic for adjusting the date based on the specified holidays and the number of periods. The function needs to correctly account for the holidays and adjust the date range accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        holidays = set(self.holidays)
        result = other
        if n > 0:
            while n > 0:
                result += timedelta(hours=1)
                if result.weekday() < 5 and result not in holidays:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                result -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if result.weekday() < 5 and result not in holidays:
                    n += 1
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by explicitly checking for holidays and adjusting the date range accordingly. The function now properly accounts for the specified holidays and correctly calculates the number of periods. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
