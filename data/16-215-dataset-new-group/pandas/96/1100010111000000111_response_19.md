The buggy function `apply` seems to be related to custom business hours and holidays, as indicated by the failing test case and the GitHub issue. The issue shows that when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, it produces more periods than expected. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` further validates this issue.

The `apply` function appears to be adjusting the provided `datetime` object based on business hours and holidays. There are several conditional checks and adjustments being made, and it's likely that the issue lies within this logic.

The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the provided datetime when using `CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated when using `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to ensure that adjustments and calculations based on business hours and holidays are accurately handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Check for holidays and adjust the provided datetime
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                # Check if the current time is outside business hours or on a holiday
                while other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
                # Move to the next business hour
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                # Check if the current time is outside business hours or on a holiday
                while other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
                # Move to the previous business hour
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made based on business hours and holidays. The provided datetime is checked for holidays, and adjustments are made accordingly to ensure the correct number of periods are generated when using `pd.date_range`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test case and the reported issue are resolved.
