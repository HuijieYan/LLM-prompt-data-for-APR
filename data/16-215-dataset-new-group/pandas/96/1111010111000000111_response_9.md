The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to custom business hours, and is used in the context of calculating business hours. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tests the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function using custom business hours with holidays included. The related GitHub issue points out the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours with periods and adding holidays.

Looking at the `apply` function, the potential error locations are the calculations to adjust business days and remaining business hours, which could lead to incorrect outputs when determining the next opening time or closing time.

The bug is causing unexpected behavior when calculating the business hours with holidays, leading to more periods than expected when the holidays are included.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to carefully handle the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours, considering the presence of holidays. The behavior of the `datetime` object adjustment, especially when adding or subtracting business days, should also be verified and adjusted if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
                other = other.to_pydatetime()

            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            starting_time = other  # Store original starting time

            # Adjust for business days taking into account holidays
            for _ in range(abs(self.n)):
                if self.n > 0:  # Forward adjustments
                    while True:
                        other = BusinessDay(calendar=self.calendar).apply(other)
                        if self._is_on_offset(other):
                            break
                        else:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:  # Backward adjustments
                    while True:
                        prev_day = other - timedelta(days=1)
                        if prev_day in self._apply_calendar:
                            other = prev_day
                            break
                        else:
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if self.n < 0:
                if starting_time == other:  # Same day and less than 0 business hours
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other)

            # Adjust for remaining business hours
            remaining_hours = self._get_remaining_business_hours(other, starting_time)

            return other + timedelta(seconds=remaining_hours)
        else:
           raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected version includes adjustments for business days and remaining business hours, taking holidays into account. It also provides more structured handling of the adjustments to ensure the correct behavior is achieved. After making this correction, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
