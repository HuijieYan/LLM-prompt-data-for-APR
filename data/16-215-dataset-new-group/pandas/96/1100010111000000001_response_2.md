The buggy function seems to be used for adjusting date and time based on business hours. The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the calculations and adjustments made for business hours and datetime.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of creating a date range using custom business hours, with a specific start time and custom holidays. The bug may be related to adjusting the business hours based on the custom holidays.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the calculations and adjustments made within the `apply` function to ensure that business hours are correctly adjusted based on the given input parameters, including the start time and holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = as_datetime(other)

        if n >= 0 and not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and self._is_on_offset(other):
            # Adjustment to move to previous business day
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self._get_business_seconds())
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        else:
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60, self._get_business_seconds())

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._next_bday(other)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            other += timedelta(0, r * 60)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                start_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                closing = self._get_closing_time(start_opening)
                remaining = closing - other
                if bhour_remain <= remaining:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= remaining
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remaining = opening - other
                if bhour_remain >= remaining:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    next_closing = self._get_closing_time(opening - timedelta(0, 1))
                    bhour_remain -= remaining
                    other = next_closing

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments to business hours are handled based on the input parameters and the edge conditions are considered. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
