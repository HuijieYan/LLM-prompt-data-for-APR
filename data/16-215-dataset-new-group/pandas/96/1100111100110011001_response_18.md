Upon reviewing the buggy function and the given error message from a failing test, we can identify that the function is designed to calculate the new time based on business hours when adding time *n* to a given date. The faulty behavior in this function is causing it to return unexpected values that are incompatible with the expected output.

The cause of the bug is in the calculation and decision-making process within the function. This may include conditions where the date and time adjustments are not correctly handled. The function performs calculations on the input date `other` based on a complex set of rules for dealing with business hours, which leads to the unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the logic to adjust the given date `other` more accurately and handle the boundary cases to ensure that it aligns with business hours as intended.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust the other to disregard timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
    
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(next_open)
    
        # remaining business hours by seconds in a business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self.next_bday
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
    
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        b_hour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        if n >= 0:
            while b_hour_remain != timedelta(0):
                prev_open_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                b_hour = self._get_closing_time(prev_open_time) - other
                    
                if b_hour_remain < b_hour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += b_hour_remain
                    b_hour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    b_hour_remain -= b_hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour)
        else:
            while b_hour_remain != timedelta(0):
                b_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if b_hour_remain >= b_hour or (b_hour_remain == b_hour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += b_hour_remain
                    b_hour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    b_hour_remain -= b_hour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function takes care of various edge cases and ensures the adjustment of the date `other` based on the business hours scenario. It should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for all relevant input cases.
