The cause of the bug is that the function `apply` ignores the input parameter `other` and performs computations based on its internal variables alone. This results in unexpected outputs/errors when the function is used. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function `apply` operates correctly on the provided input `other` and that it adjusts and returns it based on the specified conditions. Additionally, the function should adhere to the logic of Custom Business Hours and handle edge cases appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import datetime

# other imports ...

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_time = datetime.datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                self.start[0].hour,
                self.start[0].minute
            )
            end_time = datetime.datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                self.end[0].hour,
                self.end[0].minute
            )
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() > end_time.time() or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < start_time.time():
                    other = other - datetime.timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate business hours and adjust by business days
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            business_hours = (end_time - start_time).seconds
            total_minutes = abs(n * 60)
            business_days = total_minutes // business_hours
            remaining_minutes = total_minutes % business_hours

            if n < 0:
                business_days *= -1
                remaining_minutes *= -1

            if business_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # adjust remaining business hours
            remaining_timedelta = datetime.timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            while remaining_timedelta != datetime.timedelta(0):
                time_next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                time_prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                if n >= 0:
                    business_time_remaining = time_next_opening - other
                    if remaining_timedelta < business_time_remaining:
                        other += remaining_timedelta
                        remaining_timedelta = datetime.timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_timedelta -= business_time_remaining
                        other = time_next_opening
                else:
                    business_time_remaining = other - time_prev_opening
                    if remaining_timedelta > business_time_remaining:
                        other -= remaining_timedelta
                        remaining_timedelta = datetime.timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_timedelta -= business_time_remaining
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other - datetime.timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected implementation, the `apply` method should now handle the input parameter `other` correctly, taking into account the business hours, days, opening, and closing times as well as edge cases. This should resolve the failing test cases.

Please note that there may still be specific logic missing from this implementation based on the behavior of the entire codebase, so it's essential to thoroughly test this corrected function to ensure its correctness.
