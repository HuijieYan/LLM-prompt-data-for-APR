The root cause of the bug is in the logic of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method attempts to apply a business offset in terms of business hours to a given datetime object, but it includes logic that might lead to inconsistencies, especially when dealing with non-fixed frequencies and applying business offsets that cross over normal working hours or working days.

The error message from the failing test indicates a ValueError that occurs due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency. This means that the application of the business hour offset to the datetime object is not producing the expected frequency, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to revisit the logic within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and address the discrepancies that might arise when applying business offsets, especially when it comes to adjusting for working days, working hours, and edge conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps


class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            current_time = other.time()
            if n >= 0:
                if current_time >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if current_time <= self.start[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(minutes=0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(minutes=0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected logic, the `apply` method should now properly adjust the datetime object based on the business hour offset without leading to frequency-related inconsistencies. This should resolve the failing test case.
