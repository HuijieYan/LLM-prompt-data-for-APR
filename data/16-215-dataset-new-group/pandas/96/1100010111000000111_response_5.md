The cause of the bug is that when using the `pd.date_range` function with a custom frequency (`pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`) and adding holidays, the output does not match the expected number of periods. The original function `apply` does not handle business hour adjustment involving holidays correctly, resulting in incorrect periods when using the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours when holidays are present.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Holiday detected. Cannot combine business hour with a holiday.")
        
        n = self.n

        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        next_business_day = self.next_business_day(other.date())

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                if other >= next_business_day:
                    other = datetime(
                        other.year,
                        other.month,
                        other.day,
                        self.start[0].hour,
                        self.start[0].minute,
                    )
                    next_business_day = self.next_business_day(other.date())
                if other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                n -= 1
            if other.time() not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other > next_business_day:
                    other = datetime(
                        other.year,
                        other.month,
                        other.day,
                        self.end[0].hour,
                        self.end[0].minute,
                    )
                    next_business_day = self.next_business_day(other.date())
                if other.time() not in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                n += 1
            if other.time() not in self.start:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issue by correctly adjusting business hours when holidays are present. It makes use of the `self.holidays` attribute to check if the provided date is a holiday, and if so, raises an exception. Additionally, it adjusts the business hours taking into account the start and end times while handling holidays appropriately.

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
