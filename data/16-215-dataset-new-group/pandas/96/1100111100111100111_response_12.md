The issue appears to be related to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency not working properly when holidays are included, leading to incorrect results when used in `pd.date_range`. This indicates a potential issue with the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

After analyzing the source code and the runtime variable values, it seems that the bug may be related to the logic for adjusting the timestamp `other` when weekend or holidays are encountered. The holiday and weekend adjustments seem to be causing the incorrect behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic for adjusting the timestamp `other` when encountering holidays or weekends within the `apply` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            if self.n >= 0:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the timestamp `other` has been simplified and adjusted to correctly handle weekends and holidays. By directly checking if `other` falls on the offset, we avoid unnecessary adjustments and ensure the correct behavior when combined with `pd.date_range`. Now, the `apply` method should return the adjusted timestamp without unexpected results.
