The buggy function `apply` is trying to handle custom business hours with holidays, but it's failing to adjust the dates correctly, resulting in an incorrect output. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates this by showing that the generated date range does not match the expected result. The error message from the failing test indicates that a `ValueError` is raised when validating the frequency of the generated date range.

The GitHub issue "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" provides an example demonstrating the incorrect behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays. The issue states that while the function works fine without holidays, adding holidays leads to unexpected behavior.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that when adjusting the dates to handle custom business hours with holidays, the holidays themselves are properly considered in the date adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjusted code to handle holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n = self.n
            
            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
``` 

The essential change involves adjusting the dates with holidays properly in the `apply` function. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the date range generation works correctly with holidays.
