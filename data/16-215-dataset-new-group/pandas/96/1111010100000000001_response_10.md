The potential error locations within the buggy function include the date and time adjustments, the business day calculation, and the while loop conditions for adjusting the business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not adjusting the business hours properly, leading to incorrect outputs when applying business hours to a given datetime object.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for adjusting the business hours and ensure that it accurately handles both positive and negative values for the number of business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n == 0:
                return other

            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                current_close = other
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(current_close)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(next_open) - current_close
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        current_close += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_close = next_open
                return current_close
            else:
                current_open = other
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    next_close = self._get_closing_time(current_open)
                    bhour = next_close - self._prev_opening_time(current_open)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        current_open += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_open = self._next_opening_time(next_close)
                return current_open
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
