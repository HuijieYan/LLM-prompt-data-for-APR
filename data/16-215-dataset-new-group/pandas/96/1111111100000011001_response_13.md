The bug in this function is due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect datetime calculations, incorrect usage of variables, and incorrect function calls, among others.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the entire code in the `apply` function, checking the variable usage, whether the conditions are structured correctly, and whether the correct functions are being called.

Additionally, have a keen look at each control structure like if-statements and loops to verify that they're working as intended.
