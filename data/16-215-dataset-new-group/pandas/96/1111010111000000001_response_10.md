There are potential error locations within the buggy function, including:
1. Calculation errors related to adjusting business days and business hours.
2. Inconsistencies in handling positive and negative values of n.
3. Issues with the adjustment of the datetime based on business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly adjusting datetime based on business hours, leading to incorrect results, as demonstrated in the failing test.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revise the logic for adjusting business days and business hours, ensure proper handling of positive and negative values of n, and correct the adjustments of the datetime based on business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        if n >= 0:
            bhours = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour()
            adjusted_time = bhours.apply(start_time + timedelta(hours=other.hour, minutes=other.minute))
        else:
            bhours = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00')
            adjusted_time = bhours.apply(start_time + timedelta(hours=other.hour, minutes=other.minute))

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version takes into account the positive and negative values of n for adjusting the datetime based on business hours. It also simplifies the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
