The problem with the buggy function seems to be that the logic defined within it is failing to properly handle some business day calculations. To fix this bug, we need to review the handling of business days and ensure that the adjustments to business hours are implemented correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        n = self.n

        open_time = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.start_hour,
            self.start_minute
        )
        
        closing_time = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.end_hour,
            self.end_minute
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if (other.time() == self.end_time) or (other < open_time) or (other >= closing_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if (other.time() == self.start_time) or (other >= closing_time):
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if other < open_time or other >= closing_time:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should fix the bug. If you'd like to run tests on the corrected function to ensure that it functions as expected, please provide or describe suitable test cases, and I'd be happy to help.
