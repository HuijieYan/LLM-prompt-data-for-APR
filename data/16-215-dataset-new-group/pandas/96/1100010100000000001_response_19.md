There are a couple of potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of the apply_wraps decorator without being defined or imported in the provided code.
2. The use of the self attribute without being defined within the function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the missing declaration/import of the apply_wraps decorator and the self attribute not being defined within the function. The buggy function likely throws an error when executed as a result.

To fix the bug:
- Define or import the apply_wraps decorator within the code where the buggy function is located.
- Ensure that the self attribute is properly defined within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
