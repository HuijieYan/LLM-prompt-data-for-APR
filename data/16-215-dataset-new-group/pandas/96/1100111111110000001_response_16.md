The issue with the buggy function is that it is not adjusting the datetime values correctly based on the CustomBusinessHour offset. This is breaking the validation of the frequency, leading to a ValueError in the failing test.

Specifically, the buggy function is not taking into account the CustomBusinessHour offset when performing adjustments to the datetime values. This results in the datetime values not conforming to the expected frequency, leading to the validation error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime values based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Assuming the same relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged) ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust the datetime value based on the CustomBusinessHour offset
            other = CustomBusinessHour()._apply(other)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the `apply` function now correctly applies the CustomBusinessHour offset to the given datetime value, ensuring that the frequency validation will pass.

By incorporating the actual CustomBusinessHour logic, the corrected function will align with the custom business hour frequency and correctly adjust the datetime values to conform to the passed frequency.
