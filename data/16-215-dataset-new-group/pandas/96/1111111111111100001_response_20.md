The bug in the provided code is due to the mishandling of the `next_bday` attribute when it is being used as a method rather than an attribute. This causes incorrect logic to be executed, leading to the failing test. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)  # using CustomBusinessHour here
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour or nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, I've made the following changes:

1. Changed `skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)` to `skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)`.
2. Changed `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` to `if not self.is_on_offset(other):`.

These changes ensure that the correct CustomBusinessHour is used, and the `is_on_offset()` method is called correctly.

After applying these changes, the function should pass the failing test.
