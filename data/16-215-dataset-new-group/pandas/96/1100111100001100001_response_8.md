The buggy function seems to be an implementation of business hour calculation. The function is designed to take a timestamp and a number of business hours as input, and then calculate the timestamp when the specified number of business hours have elapsed. However, it contains a bug where the output is incorrect in several test cases.

The bug occurs when the business hour calculation involves crossing over to the next business day. The logic for adjusting the timestamp to the next opening time or the closing time, and handling business hours remaining within the same business day has some issues.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the timestamps and handling the remaining business hours within the same business day or when crossing over to the next business day.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other, count=bd)
    
        while r != 0:
            offset = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                increment = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if increment < offset:
                    offset -= increment
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += offset
                    r = 0
            else:
                increment = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if increment >= offset:
                    if increment == offset and other.nanosecond != 0:
                        other += offset
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        other += offset
                        r = 0
                else:
                    offset -= increment
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + increment - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the timestamps and handling the remaining business hours has been revised to address the issues identified in the bug. Specifically, the adjustment process for the business hours remaining within the same business day or when crossing over to the next business day has been improved to ensure correct business hour calculations.
