Based on the analysis of the failing test and the runtime variable values, I suggest that the bug in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class lies in the logic responsible for adjusting the time when the holiday is encountered. Currently, the adjustment logic is not handling the holidays correctly, which results in the unexpected periods in the output of the `pd.date_range` function when a holiday is present.

The goal of fixing the bug is to ensure that the adjustment logic for holidays in the `apply` function works correctly, leading to the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function, as described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holiday and adjust time
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            if other.time() < self.start:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start)
            elif other.time() >= self.end:
                next_bday = other.date() + timedelta(days=1)
                while next_bday.weekday() > 4 or next_bday in self.holidays:
                    next_bday += timedelta(days=1)
                other = datetime.combine(next_bday, self.start)

        # Rest of the function unchanged
        n = self.n
        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The logic for handling holidays in the corrected `apply` function properly adjusts the time for the given holiday, ensuring that the subsequent business hours are aligned correctly.

With this correction, the failing test and the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function with CustomBusinessHour and holidays should now be as expected.
