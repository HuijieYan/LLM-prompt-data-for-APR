Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency not properly handling holidays when used with the `periods` parameter in the `pd.date_range` function.

The issue seems to arise when `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and a list of holidays is called with the `periods` parameter. Instead of returning the expected number of periods, it produces more than 14 periods, including dates that fall on holidays.

The issue is specifically related to the incorrect handling of holidays when used in conjunction with the `periods` parameter of `pd.date_range`. This is likely due to the buggy function not properly accounting for holidays when calculating the business hours within a given time range.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when adjusting the business hours within the specified time range.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method that addresses the bug:

```python
# ... (other functions and class declarations remain unchanged)

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                temp = other
                while True:
                    temp = self._next_opening_time(temp)
                    if temp.date() not in self.holidays:
                        other = temp
                        break
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` method now includes proper handling of holidays. When adjusting the business hours to account for negative offsets and holidays, it checks for holidays in the given time range and appropriately adjusts the datetime to skip over holidays when calculating the business hours.

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `apply` method should fix the bug and ensure that `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and a list of holidays correctly returns the expected number of periods without including dates that fall on holidays.
