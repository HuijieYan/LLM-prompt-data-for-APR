Looking at the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the frequency validation of a DatetimeIndex with a custom business hour. The error occurs when trying to validate the frequency, and it is failing with a `ValueError` due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

Upon examining the `apply` function, it seems that there is a potential issue with the adjustment of the `other` datetime based on the business hours and business days. The adjustment logic might not be handling different scenarios correctly, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime within the `apply` function and ensure that it accurately reflects the intention of applying the business hours and days. Additionally, checking and correcting the handling of time intervals, business days, and business hours might resolve the issue.

While correcting the bug, it would be beneficial to incorporate more structured handling of different cases and scenarios for adjusting the datetime to align with business hours and days accurately. This will prevent any inconsistencies or mismatches, leading to a correctly adjusted datetime.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                business_hours_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                business_hours_interval = business_hours_start - other
                other = other + business_hours_interval
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                business_hours_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                business_hours_end = self._get_closing_time(business_hours_start)
                other = business_hours_end

        # business hours calculation
        business_hours_seconds = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_seconds // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.other.is_on_offset(adjust_dt):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjust_dt)
                remain = adjust_dt - prev_open
                adjust_dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                adjust_dt += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjust_dt)) - adjust_dt
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    adjust_dt += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjust_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjust_dt + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjust_dt) - adjust_dt
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    adjust_dt += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjust_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjust_dt + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return adjust_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected `apply` function, it addresses the potential logic issues and ensures accurate adjustment of the datetime based on business days and hours. This should resolve the `ValueError` that was occurring due to frequency validation failure.
