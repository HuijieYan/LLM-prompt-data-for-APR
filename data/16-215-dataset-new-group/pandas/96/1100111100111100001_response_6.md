The bug in the given function is likely causing the failing test due to the logic inside the function that is not correctly handling business hours and days. 

The root cause of the bug appears to be that the function `_validate_frequency` within the `DatetimeIndex` or `TimedeltaIndex` class is raising a `ValueError` exception with the message "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH." This error likely indicates that the frequency inferred during the frequency validation does not match the passed frequency and is leading to the overall failure of the test.

To fix the bug, the function should be reviewed to ensure that the frequency validation and handling of business hours and days is correctly implemented.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# ... (other functions)

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the other datetime takes into account whether the business time interval is greater or less than 0, and appropriately adjusts the `other` datetime. This should address the bug that was causing the failing test.
