The bug in the provided function is causing the ValueError when testing the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function. 

The bug occurs because the `apply` function is not handling the CustomBusinessHour frequencies correctly, resulting in an incompatible frequency being used which leads to the ValueError. 

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the CustomBusinessHour frequencies and align them with the specific business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps 
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
        n = self.n
        start_time = self.offset_rules.get('start')
        end_time = self.offset_rules.get('end')
        business_start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, start_time.hour, start_time.minute, start_time.second, start_time.microsecond)
        business_end_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, end_time.hour, end_time.minute, end_time.second, end_time.microsecond)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > business_end_time.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < business_start_time.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correctly setting the `business_start_time` and `business_end_time` and aligning them with the `other` datetime, the frequency will be adjusted to the CustomBusinessHour correctly.

This corrected function should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
