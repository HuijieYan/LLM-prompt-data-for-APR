The buggy function `apply` attempts to adjust the input datetime based on the business hours and holidays specified in the `self` parameter. However, it fails to handle the adjustment correctly, leading to incorrect results and the tests to fail. The failure message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

The root cause of the bug is not handling the holidays properly while adjusting the datetime. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a `CustomBusinessHour` with a holiday specified and expects the adjusted datetime to handle it correctly.

To fix the bug, the handling of holidays should be improved and the adjustment of the datetime for business hours must be made more robust to account for holidays and other edge cases. Additionally, the adjustment process should conform to the specified frequency to avoid any mismatch.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle holidays
        while other in self.holidays:
            other += self.offset

        # apply the offset
        if self.n >= 0:
            while other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += self.offset
        else:
            while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= self.offset

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, I've improved the handling of holidays by introducing a loop to check and adjust the datetime as long as it falls on a holiday. Then, the function applies the offset according to the specified business hours while considering the direction of adjustment (positive or negative).

With these improvements, the corrected function should now handle the adjustment of the datetime correctly and pass the failing test.
