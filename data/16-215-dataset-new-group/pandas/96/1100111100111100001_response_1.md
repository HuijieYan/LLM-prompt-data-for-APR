The bug in the function is likely caused by improper variable usage and logic. The main issue is with how 'other' is being manipulated for different values of 'n' (a number of business hours). Additionally, there are typos in the buggy function such as 'self.next_bday' instead of 'self.next_bday.is_on_offset', 'bd' and 'r' values are manipulated incorrectly, and typos like "other.time()" and "divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)". Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. The function rely on several critical attributes of the object. These attributes are used to perform different operations on the input timestamp 'other' based on the number of business hours 'n' and some other conditions. Identify and correct the typos, variable usage, and logic within the function to handle these attributes properly.

2. Check for the correct usage and manipulation of 'other', 'n', 'self.next_bday', 'businesshours', 'bd', and 'r' at different parts of the function.

3. The bug cause is related to how 'other' is handled and manipulated given different conditions and 'n' values, which leads to the erroneous output values.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the usage of 'other' variable manipulations and the 'bd' and 'r' value adjustments based on the value of 'n'.

5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... previous code ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime.combine(other, time())
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # ... rest of the code for adjusting business hours and days ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the variable manipulations and the logic within the 'if' and 'else' blocks, we can handle the 'other' parameter correctly and achieve the expected behavior for different values of 'n'.
