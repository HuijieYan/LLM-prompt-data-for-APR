To fix the buggy function, we need to focus on the following areas:
1. Ensure proper handling of the input "other" to accurately calculate the adjusted datetime.
2. Verify the adjustment logic for negative and positive values of "n" to handle different cases correctly.
3. Check if the business day skip and the remaining business hours are adjusted accurately.
4. Verify the conversion of the result back to the expected datetime type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    
    # ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return as_datetime(other)  # Convert back to datetime object
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this fixed version, we have added appropriate variable assignments and updated the logic for adjusting the datetime value, handling positive and negative values of "n", adjusting business days, and handling remaining business hours. We also ensured that the final result is converted back to the expected datetime type using the `as_datetime` function.

With these changes, the function should now accurately handle the adjustments based on the provided cases and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
