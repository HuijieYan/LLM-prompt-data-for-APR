The buggy function seems to be causing an issue with the calculation of business hours when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with specified holidays, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The issue is likely related to the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

One potential source of the bug is the handling of holidays within the `apply` function, causing the periods to be miscalculated and producing unexpected results when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly handle holidays and adjust the business hours calculation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Handle positive and negative scenarios separately
        if n >= 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(hours=1)
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate the total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After implementing this fix, the corrected version of the function should address the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
