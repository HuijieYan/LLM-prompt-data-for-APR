The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The calculation of the business hours.
2. The adjustment of other to reduce the number of cases to handle.
3. The adjustment of business days first.
4. The adjustment of remaining business hours.
5. The comparison of business hours left in this business time interval.

The bug results in the incorrect calculation of business hours, leading to unexpected behavior when adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic for adjusting business days and business hours, as well as by ensuring that the adjustment is performed accurately. Additionally, it may be helpful to simplify the logic to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone, nanosecond, and adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on n value
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Calculate the adjustment without using a loop
            adj = timedelta(minutes=self.n * 60 * 60 / businesshours)

            # Adjust based on the calculated value
            other += adj

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version, the adjustment of business days and business hours has been simplified and improved to avoid redundant calculations. The logic for adjusting based on the n value has been updated to accurately calculate the adjustment without using a loop. This should help resolve the issue when adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
