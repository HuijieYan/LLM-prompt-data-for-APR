After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the custom business hour offset and holidays. The failing test is test_date_range_with_custom_holidays, which is designed to create a date range using the CustomBusinessHour offset and adding a holiday. The error message points to a ValueError being raised during the validation of the frequency, which indicates that the business hours adjustment logic might be causing the issue.

The buggy function contains complex datetime calculations and adjustments based on the business hours, holidays, and additional time adjustments. The immediate cause of the bug might be due to incorrect day and hour adjustments when the business hour offset and holidays are involved, leading to unexpected output from the date_range function and triggering a ValueError during frequency validation.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and simplify the datetime adjustment logic, ensuring that the adjustments for the business hour offset and holidays are correctly implemented to provide the expected date ranges without causing conflicts.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for holidays
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Now, adjust the datetime based on business hours
        hour_adjustment = timedelta(hours=self.n)
        adjusted_datetime = other + hour_adjustment
        
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the input datetime falls on a holiday and adjusts it accordingly. Then, the datetime is adjusted based on the business hours offset, simplifying the adjustments and avoiding potential conflicts that might lead to unexpected results or errors. This corrected version should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
