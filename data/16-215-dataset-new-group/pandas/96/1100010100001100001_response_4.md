The buggy function `apply` is designed to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset to a given datetime. It adjusts the datetime based on the offset and business hours.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the bug is caused by incorrect calculations in the logic that adjusts the `other` datetime based on the provided offset.

The buggy logic seems to be manipulating the `other` datetime incorrectly and failing to properly account for the offsets and business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments to the datetime.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime according to the offset and business hours needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially rewritten.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                other = other + timedelta(days=bd)
            else:
                other = other - timedelta(days=bd)
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                time_interval = self._get_closing_time(opening_time) - opening_time
                if r < time_interval.seconds // 60:
                    other = opening_time + timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= time_interval.seconds // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + time_interval)
        else:
            while r < 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_interval = closing_time - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if -r < time_interval.seconds // 60:
                    other = closing_time - timedelta(minutes=-r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r += time_interval.seconds // 60
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(closing_time) - timedelta(seconds=1)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime has been revised to accurately handle the offset and business hours, considering both positive and negative cases for the number of business hours. This updated version should address the issues observed with the original buggy function.
