The buggy function has several potential error locations:
1. The conditional statements involving adjustments to the `other` value based on the value of `n`.
2. The calculation of business hours and adjustments made for business days.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly adjusting the `other` value based on the number of business hours and days. This results in the incorrect handling of timing intervals and business days, leading to an inaccurate final result.

To fix the bug, the conditional adjustments for the `other` value need to be carefully reviewed and corrected. The logic for adjusting business days and business hours should be thoroughly checked and compared with the intended behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for business days
        if n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Adjust by business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
        other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = n * businesshours

        # Finish adjusting
        other += timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and business hours are reviewed, corrected, and condensed into a more straightforward, easily understandable format. This should resolve the issues with the original buggy function.
