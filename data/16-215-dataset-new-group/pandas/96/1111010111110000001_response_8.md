The issue with the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems related to the logic for adjusting the `other` value. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is using the `CustomBusinessHour` with specified holidays, and the `apply` method fails to properly adjust the opening time and closing time during holiday periods. As a result, the test is failing with a ValueError for the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the logic in the `apply` method to properly adjust the opening and closing times during holidays and business days. Additionally, the adjustments for business days and business hours need to be revised to ensure the correct result.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            other = other + skip_bd
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
 

With this revised `apply` method, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass without encountering the ValueError.
