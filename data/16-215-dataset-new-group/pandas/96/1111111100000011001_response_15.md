The function is buggy because it contains a mix of mathematical operations and datetime calculations that are not in line with the expected calculations for business hours. The primary issue seems to be with the calculation and adjustment of business days and business hours.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be refactored to properly handle business days and business hours adjustments according to the specified input. Additionally, the nested loops for adjusting business hours based on the remaining time should be reviewed for accuracy and efficiency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Other relevant imports can be included here

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods from the same class and file

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            n = self.n

            # Adjust the other datetime based on the business rules
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Perform business days and business hours adjustments
            total_business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            adjusted_datetime = self._adjust_business_days_and_hours(other, n, total_business_hours)

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _adjust_business_days_and_hours(self, other, n, businesshours):
        if n != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(n * 60) % (businesshours // 60))
        sign = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

        if n >= 0:
            other += self._adjust_business_hours_positive(bhour_remain, sign)
        else:
            other += self._adjust_business_hours_negative(bhour_remain, sign)

        return other

    def _adjust_business_hours_positive(self, bhour_remain, sign):
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if sign * bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= sign * bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        return other

    def _adjust_business_hours_negative(self, bhour_remain, sign):
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if sign * bhour_remain > bhour or (sign * bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= sign * bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        return other
```

The corrected version of the function appropriately performs the adjustment of business days and business hours based on the specified input parameters.
