The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is designed to adjust a given datetime according to business hours and days.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:

1. Incorrect usage of the `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` method, which is likely a typo and should be `self.is_on_offset`.
2. Incorrect calculations in the `while` loops for adjusting the remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method is not correctly adjusting the datetime according to the business hours and days, resulting in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

To fix the bug:

1. Replace `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` with `self.is_on_offset`.
2. Adjust the calculations in the `while` loops to correctly handle the remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Code for adjusting the datetime according to business hours and days
            # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # Fix the typo and use self.is_on_offset instead of self.next_bday.is_on_offset
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # Modify condition to continue loop
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:  # Adjust comparison operator
                        other += bhour  # Adjusting by taking the entire business hour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # Modify condition to continue loop
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other)
                        )
 
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the `apply` method should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
