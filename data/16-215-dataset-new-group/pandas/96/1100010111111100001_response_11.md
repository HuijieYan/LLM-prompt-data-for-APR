The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the adjustment of business days, business hours, and the comparison of timestamps with the start and end of a business hour. The bug causes the `apply` function to return incorrect timestamps for certain inputs, resulting in a failed test case.

The bug appears to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours. It seems that the adjustment logic for negative business days (`self.n`) is not properly handling the edge conditions, resulting in incorrect timestamp adjustments.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the adjustment logic for both positive and negative business days is correctly implemented.
2. The logic for adjusting business hours within the same business day should also be reviewed and potentially revised.
3. The logic for identifying the start and end of a business hour, and comparing the timestamps with these values should be carefully checked to prevent any off-by-one errors or incorrect comparisons.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected implementation simplifies the logic for adjusting business days and hours, and it also revises the logic for comparing timestamps with the start and end of a business hour. Additionally, I've removed some intermediary variables that were not used in the original logic.
