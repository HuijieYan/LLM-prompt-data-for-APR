The buggy function `apply` is causing unexpected behavior when applying custom business hours with holidays using the `pd.date_range` function. The issue reported on GitHub is related to this problem, where adding holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency leads to more periods being generated than expected.

The potential error in the buggy function could be how it handles adjustments related to holidays, impacting the calculation of business hours and the resulting periods.

The bug occurs due to how the function applies the custom business hour offsets when holidays are specified. It leads to incorrect period calculations, as seen in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle business hour adjustments when holidays are included.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # handle adjustment for holidays
        if self.onOffset(other) and self._is_holiday(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # original implementation for business hour adjustments 
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function adjusts for holidays before performing the business hour adjustments, ensuring that the periods are calculated correctly when applying the custom business hour offset.

By making these changes, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the `pd.date_range` function should work as expected when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.
