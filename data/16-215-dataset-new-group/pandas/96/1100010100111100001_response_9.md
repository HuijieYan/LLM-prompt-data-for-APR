The problem with the buggy function `apply` is that it does not correctly adjust the datetime based on the provided custom business hour. The function also has various conditional branching that might lead to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly adjust the datetime to the next business hour based on the input parameters, especially in the case of negative offsets.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and offsets. We should also ensure that the adjustments for negative offsets are accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        adjusted_datetime = other

        # Adjust for positive offset
        if self.n > 0:
            current_time = datetime.time(other.hour, other.minute)
            if current_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust for negative offset
        if self.n < 0:
            current_time = datetime.time(other.hour, other.minute)
            if current_time in self.start:
                adjusted_datetime = adjusted_datetime - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

        return adjusted_datetime

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

The corrected version of the function should accurately adjust the input datetime based on the provided business hour offset. This should fix the issue and ensure that the failing test cases pass.
