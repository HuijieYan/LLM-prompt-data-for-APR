Looking at the buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin`, it seems to have several potential error locations. The logic for adjusting the datetime `other` based on business hours and days seems to be the main area of concern. There are multiple conditional checks, loops, and adjustments that could be causing the bug.

The potential cause of the bug could be related to the logic of adjusting the business hours and days, especially in the sections where the code checks for positive or negative business days (`if bd != 0`, `if n >= 0`, `if n < 0`) and subsequent adjustments.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to thoroughly review and simplify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days. It might involve breaking down the logic into smaller, more manageable steps and ensuring that the adjustments are correctly applied based on the input `other` datetime.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    adjusted_datetime = other

    if self.is_on_offset(other):
        return adjusted_datetime

    for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
        # Adjust for the next business day if needed
        if self.n >= 0:
            if adjusted_datetime.time() in end:
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
        else:
            if adjusted_datetime.time() in start:
                adjusted_datetime -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

    return adjusted_datetime
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime has been simplified and broken down into smaller steps to avoid potential errors. The is_on_offset method is used to check if the datetime is already on the offset, and adjustments are made accordingly. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
