The bug in the function `apply` is causing unexpected behavior when using the `pd.date_range` function with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adding holidays. This is specifically related to the return of the `apply` function encountering issues, causing `date_range` to produce incorrect results.

The primary cause of the bug appears to be in the business day calculations in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect adjustments and an unexpected number of periods in the output.

To fix the bug, the adjustments made for hours and business days need to be reviewed, and the logic for adjusting dates based on holidays should be refined.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this version, the adjustments for hours and business days have been restructured to ensure accurate handling of the given business hours and holidays. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
