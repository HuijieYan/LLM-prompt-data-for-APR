The bug in the given function seems to be related to the adjustment of the input datetime object `other` based on the business hours defined in the `self` object. Based on the provided runtime values and types, we observed the following failure scenarios:

1. The function misbehaves when adjusting the input `other` to reduce the number of cases to handle. It performs some checks and adjustments based on the value of `n` and the business hours defined by `self`, but in some cases, it fails to accurately adjust the input datetime object.

2. The function also seems to misbehave when trying to adjust by business days first. It does not handle the cases where the input datetime object does not align with the business hour schedule effectively.

3. There are multiple instances of nested while loops that adjust the remaining business hours, and based on the observed output values, it seems these loops do not cover all possible edge cases.

Given these observations, it looks like the main issue lies in the logic used to handle the adjustment of the input datetime object based on the business hours and business days. To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully review and revise the adjustment logic, ensuring that all edge cases are handled effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the function, with improvements in the adjustment logic to properly handle edge cases:

```python
# Importing required classes and functions
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# Function to apply business hour adjustments
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    n = self.n
    closing_times = [self._get_closing_time(other.replace(hour=h.hour, minute=h.minute)) for h in self.start]
    businesshours = sum((c - o).seconds for o, c in zip(self.start, closing_times))
    
    # Adjust by business days first
    business_days_to_adjust = n // businesshours
    remaining_hours = n % businesshours

    if business_days_to_adjust != 0:
        other += timedelta(days=business_days_to_adjust)
    
    # Handle remaining hours
    while remaining_hours != 0:
        for i, start_time in enumerate(self.start):
            end_time = closing_times[i]
            
            if start_time <= other.time() < end_time or (i == len(self.start) - 1 and end_time <= other.time()):
                current_interval_hours = (end_time - other).seconds // 3600
                
                if n >= 0:
                    if remaining_hours <= current_interval_hours:
                        other += timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= current_interval_hours
                        other = other.replace(hour=end_time.hour, minute=end_time.minute)

                else:
                    if remaining_hours <= current_interval_hours:
                        other -= timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_hours += current_interval_hours
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other.replace(hour=start_time.hour, minute=start_time.minute)))
    
    return other
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the adjustment of the input datetime object accurately reflects the business hour schedule and properly handles both business days and remaining hours. This should effectively fix the bug.
