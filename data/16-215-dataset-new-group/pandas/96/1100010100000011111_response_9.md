The buggy function has a condition that checks if `other` is an instance of `datetime`. However, the condition does not handle all possible scenarios and does not correctly handle the adjustment of business hours. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as returning the incorrect datetime values.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to address the issues with handling the adjustment of business hours. The adjustments should be correctly performed based on the provided `other` datetime and the business hours defined by the `self` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        bhour_remain = self.n * 60  # Convert minutes to business hours
        result = BusinessHour(n=0)  # Initialize with zero business hour adjustment

        while bhour_remain != 0:
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + result)
            bhour = next_opening_time - (other + result)
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                result += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:  # Finish adjusting if the remaining business hours fit within the current business time interval
                result += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = 0

        return other + result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
1. The calculation of the remaining business hours is simplified and correctly adjusted based on the given input values.
2. The adjustment of business hours is performed iteratively to handle all scenarios, ensuring that the correct datetime value is returned.

By using this corrected version, the issues reported in the GitHub issue can be addressed, and the function will produce the expected output.

Please note that the corrected version assumes the proper functioning of the helper methods like `_next_opening_time`. If there are issues with these methods, they should be addressed separately.
