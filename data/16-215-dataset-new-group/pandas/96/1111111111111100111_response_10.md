## Correction of the buggy function

To fix the bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, we need to address the incorrect handling of business hours and holidays, which is causing the failing test. The issue is related to the calculation of business days and business hours when holidays are involved.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves making the following changes:
- Handle holidays properly, ensuring that the adjusted date is not considered a business day if it falls on a holiday.
- Adjust the business hours calculation and iteration to accommodate holidays and non-business days.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
# Import statements
from datetime import time, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay, CustomBusinessMixin

# Buggy function definition within the BusinessHourMixin class
class BusinessHourMixin(CustomBusinessMixin):
    
    # ... Other functions ...
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other_time = other.time()
            
            if n >= 0:  # For positive business hours
                if other_time in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:  # For negative business hours
                if other_time in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            bd, _ = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd = -bd
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                next_bday = other + skip_bd
                while not self.is_on_offset(next_bday):
                    next_bday = self._next_opening_time(next_bday)
                other = next_bday
            
            # Adjust based on business hours
            _, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=r)
            current_time = other
            
            while remaining_time > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(current_time)) - current_time
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(current_time) - current_time
                    
                if remaining_time < bhour:
                    current_time += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time + bhour)
                    else:
                        current_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(current_time + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return current_time
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the corrected `apply` function should properly handle business hours, holidays, and adjustments based on specified periods.

By making this correction, the failing test related to the issue reported on GitHub should pass, and the bug should be resolved.
