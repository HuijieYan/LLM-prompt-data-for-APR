## The cause of the bug and a strategy for fixing it

The bug is caused by the `apply()` function, which is not handling the holiday dates correctly when adjusting the frequency for custom business hours. This results in the incorrect calculation of the periods in the `date_range` function, leading to more than 14 periods being generated.

To fix this bug, the `apply()` function needs to be modified to properly account for holidays when adjusting the frequency. This can be done by checking if the date is a holiday and making the necessary adjustments to the frequency based on whether it falls on a holiday or not.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a holiday
        is_holiday = getattr(other, "date", None)() in self.holidays

        if is_holiday:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Date is a holiday")
        else:
            # existing logic for adjusting the frequency
            # ...

            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function includes an additional check for holidays before applying the frequency adjustments. If the date is a holiday, an exception is raised, indicating that the date is a holiday. Otherwise, the existing logic for adjusting the frequency is executed as before.

With this modification, the `apply()` function should handle holidays correctly, and the `date_range` function should produce the expected number of periods, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
