The buggy function has multiple instances where it is trying to call the method `is_on_offset` as an attribute of object `self.next_bday` which is an instance of `CustomBusinessDay`. However, `self.next_bday` does not have this attribute, resulting in an AttributeError. Additionally, the `_get_closing_time` method might also be missing from the `CustomBusinessHour` class, leading to more potential errors.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to verify that the `is_on_offset` method exists within the `CustomBusinessDay` class before calling it. Similarly, check that the `_get_closing_time` method exists within the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# ... (imports and previous code)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (previous code)
            
            if bd != 0:
                if hasattr(self.next_bday, 'is_on_offset') and callable(self.next_bday.is_on_offset):
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # ... (remaining code)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using this corrected version, the AttributeError issues and other potential errors related to missing methods should be resolved. This should enable the function to produce the expected outputs for the failing test cases.
