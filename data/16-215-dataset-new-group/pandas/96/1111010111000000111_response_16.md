The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The failing test is specifically related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holidays".

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function fails to correctly adjust the business hours when creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. As a result, the periods are not being calculated accurately, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to handle the adjustment of business hours when holidays are involved. Specifically, when a holiday is present and periods are being calculated using `pd.date_range`, the business hours should be adjusted to skip the holidays and calculate the periods based on correct business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for adjusting business hours with holidays included
        ... # (existing logic)

        if self.holidays is not None:
            adjusted_periods = self.get_adjusted_periods(self.holidays, other, n)
            other = self.adjust_date_from_periods(other, adjusted_periods)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    return other

def get_adjusted_periods(self, holidays, date, n):
    """
    Adjust the periods for adjusting business hours
    with holidays included.
    """
    periods = abs(n)
    holiday_hours = 0
    for holiday in holidays:
        if date.date() == holiday.date():
            holiday_hours = (
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
                - (self._get_business_hours_by_sec(holiday + timedelta(days=1), None) % 86400)
            )
    adjusted_periods = periods + (holiday_hours // 3600)
    return adjusted_periods

def adjust_date_from_periods(self, date, adjusted_periods):
    """
    Adjust the date based on adjusted periods
    and business hours.
    """
    adjusted_date = date
    if adjusted_periods != 0:
        adjusted_date += BusinessHour(n=adjusted_periods * 3600)
    return adjusted_date
```

In this corrected version, we've added a method `get_adjusted_periods` to calculate the adjusted periods by accounting for business hours and holidays. Then, a method `adjust_date_from_periods` is added to adjust the date based on the adjusted periods and business hours. Finally, we've updated the logic of the `apply` function to use these new methods for adjusting the business hours when calculating periods with holidays.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
