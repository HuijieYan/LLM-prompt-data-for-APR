Looking at the runtime input/output variable values, it seems the buggy function is not handling the adjustments for business days and business hours correctly. The implementation of adjusting business days and hours contains errors and doesn't handle all edge cases properly, leading to incorrect output.

The buggy function attempts to adjust the input date and time based on the business days and remaining business hours, but it fails to do so accurately. The `-1` correction for the previous business day and the handling of business hours left within each interval are problematic.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and hours needs to be revamped. The adjustment for business days and hours should be separated and handled independently, ensuring proper handling of edge cases.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for business days
        if n != 0:
            other = other + n * BusinessDay()

        # Adjust for business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = BusinessHour(next=True).apply(other)
                n -= 1
        else: 
            while n < 0:
                other = BusinessHour(next=False).apply(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment for business days is done separately, using the `n * BusinessDay()` operation to add or subtract the specified number of business days. Then, the adjustment for business hours is handled using a loop with `BusinessHour` instances to increment or decrement the time according to the specified business hours.

Please ensure to test this corrected function thoroughly with various inputs to ensure its correctness and accuracy.
