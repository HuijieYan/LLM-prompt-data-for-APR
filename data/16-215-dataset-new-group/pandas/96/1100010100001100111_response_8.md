The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the datetime when applying CustomBusinessHour offsets, especially when holidays are involved. The bug leads to unexpected datetime adjustments, resulting in more than the expected number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

The cause of the bug appears to be several conditional blocks within the `apply` function, particularly those related to handling positive and negative offsets for business hours and checking for holidays. The logic for adjusting datetime around holidays and business days seems to be impacting the accurate calculation of business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime. The adjustments for business days, holidays, and business hours need to be carefully evaluated to ensure the correct number of periods in the output.

We will provide a corrected version of the `apply` function focusing on resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        original_time = other.time()

        # If the datetime falls on a holiday, move to the next business day
        while other in self.holidays:
            other += timedelta(days=1)

        # Move to the start of the next business hour if the current time does not match any business hours
        while original_time not in self.start and original_time not in self.end:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)

        # Number of business hours in a day
        business_hours = len(self.start)

        # Calculate the number of business hours to adjust
        remaining_hours = n * business_hours

        # Adjust the datetime by the number of business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                # Move to the start of the next business hour
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, 0, 0)
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                remaining_hours -= 1
        else:
            while remaining_hours < 0:
                # Move to the start of the previous business hour
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, 0, 0)
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                remaining_hours += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This adjusted version of the `apply` function aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug. It involves moving to the start of the next business hour if the datetime does not fall within the specified business hours, handling holidays properly, and accurately adjusting the datetime by the number of business hours.

This corrected function should produce the expected number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range` even when holidays are involved.
