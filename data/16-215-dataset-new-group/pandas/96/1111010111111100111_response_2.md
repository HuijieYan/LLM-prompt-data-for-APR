It appears that the issue is coming from the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The reported bug mentions a problem with using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays. The expected behavior is that the function should produce the correct number of periods when holidays are added, but the actual result is incorrect.

The runtime variable values show that the `apply` function is creating an incorrect number of periods when holidays are added. This is directly related to the incorrect behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug seems to be the erroneous handling of holidays within the `apply` function. The function incorrectly modifies the date and time when a holiday is encountered, leading to an incorrect result with `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, the code within the `apply` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle holidays and maintain the expected number of periods in the date range.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    # existing code

    # adjusting business days and hours based on positive or negative n

    if bd != 0:  # business days are needed to be adjusted
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd
    
    # remaining business hours to adjust
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        # business hour left in this business time interval
        if n >= 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
        else:
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

        if bhour_remain < bhour:
            # finish adjusting if possible
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            # go to the next business time interval
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    return other
```

With these changes, the `apply` function should correctly adjust business days and hours, including handling holidays, and produce the expected number of periods in the `pd.date_range`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
