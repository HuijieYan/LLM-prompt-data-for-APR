The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is called with a datetime object as `other` and is supposed to carry out some business hour related calculations. However, it fails to produce the expected output in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the `apply` method are:
1. Condition checks on whether `other.time()` is in `self.end` and `self.start`.
2. Calculation of `other` and `bhour_remain` inside the loops.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect logic and calculations in the `apply` method, leading to the incorrect output in the failing test.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic and calculations inside the `apply` method, ensure that the condition checks are accurate and the calculations are based on valid business hour rules.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other.replace(hour=self.end[-1].hour, minute=self.end[-1].minute)
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hour calculations
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self.next_bday()
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                start_of_interval = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(start_of_interval) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(start_of_interval)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                start_of_interval = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = start_of_interval - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(start_of_interval - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` method includes accurate condition checks, correct calculations, and adjustments based on valid business hour rules. With these changes, the function should now produce the expected output in the failing test.
