After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the logic for adjusting the date and time based on business hours. The failing test specifically mentions a scenario where using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays results in more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the adjustment of dates and times to account for business hours and holidays within the `apply` function. The function adjusts the input date and time based on the specified business hour frequency, but the adjustments seem to be incorrect when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, it's essential to revisit the logic within the `apply` function, particularly the parts related to handling holidays and adjusting business hours. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and potentially rewrite the logic for adjusting dates and times to ensure that it correctly accounts for holidays without causing unexpected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays is None or other not in self.holidays:
            cbh = CustomBusinessHour(
                start=self.start,
                end=self.end,
                holidays=self.holidays
            )
            adjusted_time = cbh.rollforward(other) if self.n >= 0 else cbh.rollback(other)
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError(f"{other} is a holiday")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we create a new `CustomBusinessHour` object with the specified start, end, and holidays, and then use its `rollforward` and `rollback` methods to adjust the input date and time based on the business hours and holidays. Additionally, we check if the input date is a holiday before making any adjustments.

This corrected version should address the issue described in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, it resolves the issue mentioned on GitHub related to using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
