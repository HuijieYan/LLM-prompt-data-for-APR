The buggy function `apply` is not correctly processing the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This issue is seen in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, which attempts to create a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` class and then generate a date range.

The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This suggests that the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the date based on the custom business hours specified, leading to an incorrect inferred frequency.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic in the `apply` function, specifically the parts where the adjustments are made based on business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the time intervals based on positive/negative business hours should be checked.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # business hour starts and ends
        business_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
        business_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to the business start
        if other.time() > self.start or other.time() < self.end:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # adjust by business days first
        if n != 0:
            businessdays = n // businesshours
            remain = n % businesshours

            # adjust by business days
            if businessdays > 0:
                if remain <= (3600 * (self.end.minute - other.minute)):
                    other += timedelta(hours=(remain // 3600), minutes=((remain % 3600) // 60))
                else:
                    businessdays += 1
                    
                remain = 0
                for _ in range(businessdays):
                    while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = other + timedelta(days=1)

                # Go to the next business day if there are remaining business hours
                if remain > 0:
                    while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if remain <= (self.end.hour * 3600) + (self.end.minute * 60):
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute) + timedelta(seconds=remain)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # go to the next business day
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute) + timedelta(seconds=remain)

                return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I made several adjustments to the logic for adjusting the business hours and days. The adjustments are made based on the business days and remaining hours while considering the business start and end times. Additionally, edge cases are handled for remaining hours.

This corrected version should address the issues seen in the failing test.
