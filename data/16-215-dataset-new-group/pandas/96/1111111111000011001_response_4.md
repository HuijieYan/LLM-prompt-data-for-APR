The issue in the provided function seems to be related to the computation of the adjusted datetime value which needs to reflect the business hours and days. 

The expected values in the failing test suggest that the function should adjust the input datetime based on the business hours, days, and the next business day logic. The buggy function needs adjustments to ensure that the calculated values align with the expected values provided.

The issue might be with how the business day is being computed and adjusted when the business hour factor is taken into account.

Here's one possible way to address the issue and provide a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Check if the time is in the range of business end time
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Check if the time is in the range of business start time
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining logic remains the same

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the above code provides an introductory fix, and there may be additional aspects that need to be considered for a comprehensive solution.
