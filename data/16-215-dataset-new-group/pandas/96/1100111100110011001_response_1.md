This code seems to be a part of the pandas library. The function "apply" is called within the pandas library class for DateRange.

The error message indicates that there's a ValueError at the line raise ValueError. This is caused by some mismatched frequencies.

The issue in this function seems to be due to the business day and time adjustments. The function is supposed to adjust the input date (other) based on the business hours and working days specified, but it's failing to do so.

To debug and fix this issue, you can follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the class and all its methods called within the function are working as expected, especially the is_on_offset, _next_opening_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, and _get_closing_time methods.
2. Verify the adjustments made to the "other" date and the conditions checking if it is on the offset or not.
3. Check the business day calculations and adjustments for potential errors.
4. Identify the root cause of the mismatched frequencies causing the ValueError to be raised.

Below is a corrected version of the function. Note that this code assumes a lot of context from the classes and its methods not shown, so it's a best guess effort to fix the buggy function.

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # existing code
        
        # ... [existing code]
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay (this is a potential point of error in original function)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # This solves one potential issue
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        # existing code
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Since the correction to this issue is based on a lot of assumed context, it would be safer to refer back to the pandas library itself for a more accurate method to fix the problem.
