The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function in Pandas. The bug appears to be related to calculating business hours and adjusting datetime objects based on business days. The function is not handling business day adjustments correctly, which leads to outputting more periods than expected when holidays are included.

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime object based on business days and hours, resulting in more or less time elapsed than expected. The issue reported on GitHub also shows that the behavior of `pd.date_range` is unexpectedly affected by including holidays when using the CustomBusinessHour offset. 

To fix the bug, consider the following strategy:
1. Review the logic for adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function to ensure proper handling of holidays and business days.
2. Implement a systematic approach to calculate business days and hours and adjust the datetime object accordingly.
3. Test the function with various datetime inputs, including holidays, to ensure that it produces the correct number of periods.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the other datetime object based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    continue
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    continue
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the reported issue and ensure proper handling of business hours, holidays, and datetime adjustments. Testing with sample inputs and holidays will confirm the correctness of the fix.
