The buggy function `apply` has multiple potential error locations, including the assignment of `other` and conditional logic for adjusting the business days and hours. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expecting a specific result for a custom business hour frequency, and the buggy function is not producing the expected output.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles the adjustment of business days and business hours, as well as the conditional logic for adjusting the time intervals.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for adjusting the business days and hours needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly re-implemented to ensure the correct adjustments are made.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other functions ...

    # corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday(other)
                other += skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self.end - other if other.time() < self.end else timedelta(days=1)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self.start if other.time() >= self.start else timedelta(days=1)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic for adjusting business days and hours has been revised to ensure correct adjustments are made based on the business hour intervals. This should address the issue and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test.
