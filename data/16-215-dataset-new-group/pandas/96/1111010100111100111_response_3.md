The cause of the bug is that the function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset does not correctly handle the holidays. This results in an incorrect number of periods being returned when creating a date range with the custom business hour frequency and adding holidays.

The issue appears to stem from incorrect date adjustments when the function encounters holidays or non-business days. This results in an unexpected increase or decrease in the number of periods in the date range.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles holidays and non-business days correctly, adjusting the date according to the expected behavior of a custom business hour frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = other
        while n != 0:
            start_time = self._handle_periods_forward(start_time, self.end, self.start)
            if self._is_holiday(start_time):
                start_time = self._shift_to_business_day(start_time)
                continue
            n -= 1
        return start_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated function ensures that the custom business hour frequency is correctly applied to the datetime object, accounting for the specified number of periods and handling holidays and non-business days accordingly. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and resolve the unexpected behavior when creating a date range with holidays and a custom business hour frequency.
