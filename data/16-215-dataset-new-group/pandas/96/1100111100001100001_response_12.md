The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustment of datetime values based on the given business hours. The buggy function `apply` appears to be incorrectly adjusting the input `other` datetime based on the `self.n` and business hours, leading to incorrect results.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values, it's clear that the adjustment of `other` datetime based on business hours and the value of `n` is causing unexpected results. In addition, the function is overly complex and difficult to follow due to the large number of control structures. 

To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the complex control flows need to be refactored and simplified. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the adjustments to the input datetime are accurately calculated based on business hours and the value of `n`.

Here's the corrected version of the function with simplified logic:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0 and other.time() in self.end and not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        while n != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=1) if n > 0 else timedelta(days=-1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic is simplified to adjust the `other` datetime based on the value of `n`. We iterate over the `other` datetime, adjusting by 1 day in the appropriate direction (based on the sign of `n`) until the desired business hours are added/subtracted. This simplification helps to reduce the likelihood of unexpected results and makes the code easier to follow.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the related functions such as `_next_opening_time`, `_is_on_offset`, and `is_on_offset` are correctly implemented and return accurate results for the given datetime inputs.

This simplified version should address the bug and provide more accurate results when adjusting the `other` datetime based on the specified business hours.
