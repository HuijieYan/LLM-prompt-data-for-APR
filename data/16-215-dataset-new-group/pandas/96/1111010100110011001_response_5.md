The buggy function `apply()` seems to have issues related to date and time calculations. There are different iterations of the same problem, including locating the correct business hour based on input parameters and handling edge cases for skipping business days.

The function seems too complex and a potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to refactor its logic, including extracting parts of the code into separate functions to make it easier to test and debug.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # check if it's on the offset
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            # identify the next opening time
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # in case n is positive
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    return opening_time

                if opening_time != other:
                    return opening_time
                else:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    while other.time() >= closing_time.time():
                        other += timedelta(days=1)
                    return self._next_opening_time(other)

            # n is negative
            else:
                # identify previous opening time
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                if other.time() in self.start:
                    return prev_opening - timedelta(seconds=1)

                # If it's not on the same opening minute
                if opening_time != prev_opening:
                    return opening_time

                new_time = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))
                while other.time() <= new_time.time():
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                return self._prev_opening_time(other)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The refactored version aims to simplify the conditional logic and handle edge cases more clearly, making the code easier to understand and maintain. After refactoring, the corrected version of the function should satisfy the input/output values. It should be thoroughly tested to confirm its reliability.
