The bug appears to be related to how the `CustomBusinessHour` time intervals are handled within the `apply` function. It seems that the function does not properly adjust the time intervals for business hours and fails to add the right number of business days and remaining business hours.

The bug fix strategy includes the following steps:
1. Modify the logic to properly handle the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensure that time intervals for business hours are calculated correctly.
3. Fix any discrepancies in timezone handling and ensure that the adjustments are made appropriately for the given input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function `apply`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues by adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the number of business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`). Additionally, it correctly handles the time intervals for business hours, ensuring that the adjustments are made according to the given input parameters.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should resolve the issues and pass the failing test.
