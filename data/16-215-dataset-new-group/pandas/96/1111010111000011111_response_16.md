The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has several issues:
1. The code has conditional logic surrounding the adjustment of the input `other` datetime, which may not correctly handle all edge cases.
2. The calculation of business hours and adjustments using timedelta may not be accurate.
3. The way the business days are adjusted may not be correct in all scenarios.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday". The failing test expects specific datetime index values based on the provided start time, periods, and frequency with holidays, but the buggy function does not produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for adjusting the input datetime for both positive and negative `n` values should be thoroughly reviewed. Additionally, the calculations for business hours, adjustments, and the handling of holidays need to be checked to ensure accuracy.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end else other
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
            return other
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other) if other.time() in self.start else other
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n += 1
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and adjusts the `other` datetime based on the business hours without unnecessary conditional complexities.

With the fixed function, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expected to pass and produce the correct datetime index values based on the given start time, periods, and frequency with holidays, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
