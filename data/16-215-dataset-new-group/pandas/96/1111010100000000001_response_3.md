These are the potential issues with the buggy function:

1. Incorrect indentation and spacing
2. Use of undeclared variables
3. Incorrect assignment and use of `other` datetime object

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect assignment and calculation of the `other` datetime object within the function. This creates confusion and incorrect results when calculating the adjusted datetime.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all variables used are declared and have the correct values assigned. The logic responsible for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the business hours also needs to be reviewed and modified if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
```

In the corrected function, the variable `n` is properly declared before using it, and the conditional checks for adjusting the `other` datetime object have been reorganized to ensure correct logic. Additionally, the incorrect use of `nanosecond` has been removed, as it was causing further confusion in the calculation.
