The issue with the `CustomBusinessHour` class is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function. The `CustomBusinessHour` class is not handling holidays properly when used with periods. This results in the output having more than the expected number of periods.

The cause of this bug is in the `_apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The logic for handling holidays and adjusting the timestamp is not correctly implemented, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

To fix this bug, the logic of handling holidays and adjusting the timestamp needs to be updated in the `_apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_apply` method:

```python
def _apply(self, other, n):
    start = other.floor('D')
    end = other.ceil('D')
    idx = pd.date_range(start, end, freq='B')
    mask = ~(idx.normalize().isin(self.holidays))

    bh = CustomBusinessHour(
        start=self.start,
        end=self.end,
        holidays=self.holidays,
        weekmask=self.weekmask
    )

    if n >= 0:
        return bh[idx[idx >= other][mask[idx >= other]].index[n]]
    else:
        return bh[idx[idx <= other][mask[idx <= other]].index[n]]
```

This updated method ensures that holidays are properly handled, and the adjustment of the timestamp for periods is correctly carried out. With this fix, the `pd.date_range` function should now work as expected with `CustomBusinessHour` and handle holidays properly.
