The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The purpose of the function is to apply custom business hours to a given datetime.

The failing test, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, calls the `apply` function indirectly by using it to create a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and then generating a date range using that frequency. The test is expecting a specific set of datetimes as the result.

The error message indicates that a `ValueError` is being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method, which is triggered by the `apply` function. The error message states that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

Upon analyzing the `apply` function, it's clear that the logic to adjust the datetime based on the custom business hours may not be working correctly.

The following strategy can be used to fix the bug:
1. Check the logic for adjusting the datetime to consider the custom business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied for both positive and negative business hours.
3. Check for potential issues with comparisons or calculations related to the custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_datetime = other
        if n > 0:
            # If n is positive, adjust the datetime to the next opening time
            while not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
        elif n < 0:
            # If n is negative, adjust the datetime to the previous opening time
            while not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
        # Add business hours in minutes according to adjusted n
        adjusted_datetime += timedelta(minutes=n * 60)
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments to the datetime take into account both positive and negative business hours, ensuring that the custom business hours are correctly applied.

Upon using this corrected version in the failing test, it should pass without raising the `ValueError` that was previously encountered.
