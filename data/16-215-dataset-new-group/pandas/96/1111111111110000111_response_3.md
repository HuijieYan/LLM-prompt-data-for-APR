The bug seems to be related to the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. After analyzing the code and the provided failing test, it appears that the issue arises from the improper handling of holidays when generating the date range.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` includes a frequency of `CustomBusinessHour` with a specific start time and a holiday on "2020-11-26". The expected result is a date range with only 4 periods, taking into account the holiday.

The error message indicates a problem with the validation of the frequency, and it is failing with a `ValueError`. This indicates that the holiday is not being properly considered when generating the date range, resulting in more than 14 periods.

To fix this issue, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when generating the date range. The holiday should be taken into account when calculating the date range periods. We need to consider the business hours and skip the holiday accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ...

        # adjust other based on the business day and holiday
        if n >= 0:
            # existing code remains for positive n
            # ...
        else:
            # Adjust for negative n and holidays
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            # skipping the holiday
            while other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # modify the date range generation logic to consider holidays
        result = []
        while len(result) < abs(n):
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and other not in self.holidays:
                result.append(other)

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the `apply` function should now properly handle holidays and generate the correct date range for custom business hours.

These changes are intended to address the issue by allowing the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when generating the date range for custom business hours. Moreover, it should resolve the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
