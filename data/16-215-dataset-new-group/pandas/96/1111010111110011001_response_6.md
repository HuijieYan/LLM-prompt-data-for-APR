The buggy function is used to calculate the adjusted time using business hours. There might be an issue with the calculation of skipped business days that is causing the bug.

In this case, the `func` provided below is meant to handle custom Business Hours, but it is not functioning as expected. This is leading to a failing test. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking for the expected DateIndex using custom business hours. When it fails, it throws a `ValueError`, as some values do not conform.

The cause of the bug could be the incorrect calculation for skipped business days within the `apply` function. Additionally, the adjustment of business hours might introduce some issues in the business days calculations.

To fix this bug, follow these steps:
1. First, you may need to identify a clearer input/output relationship for the `apply` function, and then work through some test cases to fix the bug. Since the implementation is quite complex, there may not be a straightforward solution. It might involve requiring a deeper understanding of the relationship between `BusinessMixin`, `apply`, and related classes and methods in the module.
2. Review the skipped business days calculation and ensure the adjustment of business hours is done correctly.
3. Verify the correctness of the logic and ensure that all edge cases are handled.
4. Testing with different business hour configurations and date ranges would be important to ensure the correctness of the fix.
5. Once the bug is identified and the fix is applied, the corrected version of the function should be designed to pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=self.start.hour,
            minute=self.start.minute,
        )
        end_time = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=self.end.hour,
            minute=self.end.minute,
        )

        # calculate time difference
        time_diff = end_time - start_time
        business_hours = time_diff.total_seconds() / 60

        # adjust for positive/negative business hours
        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_time = start_time
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=business_hours)
                if not is_business_day(adjusted_time):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            adjusted_time = end_time
            while n < 0:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(minutes=business_hours)
                if not is_business_day(adjusted_time):
                    n += 1

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Note: Some adjustments have been made to the logic of the `apply` function. This suggested implementation aims to ensure that the final result is adjusted according to business hours and business days. However, to cover more edge cases, further testing and fine-tuning of this function might be needed.
