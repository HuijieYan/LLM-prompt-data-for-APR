### Analysis
The function `apply` is throwing an error when it encounters the `raise ValueError` in the `try-except` block. This indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This error happens when a custom business hour is being used in the `apply` function to generate the frequency when calling `pd.date_range`.


### Error Locations
The potential error location seems to be in the condition `if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8)` within the `try-except` block.


### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the custom business hour frequency, which does not conform to the passed frequency. It seems that the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the frequency when a custom business hour is used.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by properly adjusting the frequency and ensuring that it conforms to the desired custom business hour frequency when using the `apply` function to generate date ranges.


### Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
Please note that the issue causing the error is likely not within the `apply` function itself, as the error originates from a validation function. The remediation could necessitate making changes within the validation function, such as `_validate_frequency`, or within the parameters being passed to `apply`.
