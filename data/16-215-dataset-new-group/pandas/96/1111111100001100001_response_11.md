The bug in the function is that it is not correctly adjusting the business days and remaining business hours to the input date. This is causing inconsistencies in the output date and time, leading to failed tests.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of business days and remaining business hours. The function is not properly adjusting the business days and remaining hours based on the input date and time, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly adjust the business days and remaining hours. This will involve accurately calculating the business days to skip and adjusting the remaining hours based on the input date and time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Original imports are assumed to be included

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... Other class functions

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, the adjustment of business days and remaining hours has been modified to ensure the correct handling of input date and time. This should address the inconsistencies and ensure that the function produces the expected results.
