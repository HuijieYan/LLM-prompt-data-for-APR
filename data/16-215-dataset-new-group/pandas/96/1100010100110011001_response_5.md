The buggy function throws an error when trying to cast the `other` variable to a datetime using `datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond)`. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours, business days, and starting or ending times. The exceptions and conditions applied within the function depend on whether the shift is forward or backward in time.

The current method of casting `other` to a datetime object is one of the main causes of the error. This is because the code does not account for different timezone and daylight saving settings that may alter the operating hours.

The strategy to fix the bug is to use pandas Timestamp to create a datetime variable that has these considerations. We need to use the Timestamp type to ensure that the full context and timezone information about the date time object is maintained.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = pd.Timestamp(other)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
