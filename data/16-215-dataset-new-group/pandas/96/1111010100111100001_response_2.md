The bug in the apply function occurs when it tries to add or subtract business hours to a given datetime, based on the specified business schedule. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments to the input datetime for negative business hours (n < 0) and no adjustments for positive business hours (n >= 0), leading to incorrect output and a ValueError.

The buggy function is part of the BusinessHourMixin class, which is responsible for applying business hour logic to a given datetime. The apply function is supposed to return a new datetime object after applying the business hour logic based on the specified business schedule.

The buggy function attempts to adjust the input datetime based on the business schedule's start and end times for positive and negative business hours. However, there are issues related to conditional checks and calculations for adjusting the datetime, leading to incorrect results and a ValueError during the tests.

The bug can be fixed by correcting the conditional checks and adjusting the input datetime accordingly based on the positive or negative business hours. Additionally, the adjustments for positive and negative business hours need to be handled separately to ensure the correct output.

Here's the corrected version of the apply function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # initial setup
    n = self.n
    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    if n >= 0:
        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
    else:
        other = other - timedelta(minutes=1) if other.time() in self.start else other
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

    total_seconds = abs(n) * 3600
    if n < 0:
        total_seconds *= -1

    # adjust the datetime based on business hours
    business_day_offset, remaining_seconds = divmod(total_seconds, businesshours)
    if n < 0:
        business_day_offset = -business_day_offset
        remaining_seconds = -remaining_seconds

    if business_day_offset != 0:
        # adjust by business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_day_offset)
        other = other + skip_bd

    # adjust the remaining business hours
    delta = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
    while delta > timedelta(0):
        next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        business_hours_interval = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time) - next_opening_time
        if delta < business_hours_interval:
            other = next_opening_time + delta
            delta = timedelta(0)
        else:
            delta -= business_hours_interval
            other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening_time + delta)

    return other
```

The corrected version of the apply function should handle the adjustments for positive and negative business hours correctly, based on the specified business schedule, and provide the expected output without any ValueError.
