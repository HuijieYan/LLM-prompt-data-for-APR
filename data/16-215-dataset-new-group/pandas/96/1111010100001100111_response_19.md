The buggy function is the `apply()` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This method is meant to apply business hours to a given datetime. The issue posted on GitHub relates to a problem with `pd.date_range` not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays. The issue results in more than the expected number of periods when the holidays are added.

After analyzing the runtime variable values and types, the cause of the bug can be identified as the incorrect treatment of holidays, leading to unexpected outputs in `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, I suggest updating the logic of how holidays are handled within the `apply()` method. The buggy function does not seem to take holidays into account when adjusting the datetime, leading to an incorrect result. By considering the holidays and their impact on the business hours, the issue with `pd.date_range` can be resolved.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply()` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or (other in self.holidays):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or (other in self.holidays):
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... (remaining existing code)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the `self.holidays` into the logic for adjusting the datetime, the corrected function will appropriately handle holidays and provide accurate results when used in `pd.date_range` and similar scenarios.
