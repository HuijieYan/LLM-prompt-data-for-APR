The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of holidays when generating custom business hours using pandas' `date_range` function. The GitHub issue details a scenario where adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset results in unexpected behavior, producing more periods than specified.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the issue may be related to the adjustment of the input datetime `other` when holiday dates are encountered. The `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` functions are called to handle these adjustments, and the bug could potentially lie within the logic of these functions.

The buggy function applies a series of adjustments to the input datetime based on the provided custom business hours. It also checks for holidays and seems to recalculate the next opening time and closing time based on the holiday. However, due to the complex logic and handling of business days, business hours, and holidays, it's possible that the calculations are not handling the scenarios with holidays and business hours correctly.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to revisit the logic for adjusting the input datetime when a holiday is encountered and to thoroughly test the custom business hour functionality with and without holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy code:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Handling of holidays and business hours
            if self.on_offset(other):
                bday = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour)
                intervals = (other - bday).seconds // 3600
                if intervals < len(self.offsets):
                    return datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.offsets[intervals].hour)
                else:
                    return self._apply_holiday_logic(other)
            else:
                return self._apply_holiday_logic(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # Helper function to adjust for holidays
    def _apply_holiday_logic(self, other):
        adjustments = 0
        while adjustments <= 24 * 7:  # Adjust for a week
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
            if self.on_offset(other):
                return other
            adjustments += 1
        raise ValueError("Holiday adjustment not working")

# Usage example
start_date = datetime(2020, 11, 25, 10, 0)
custom_bh = CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'])
result = custom_bh.apply(start_date)

print(result)
```

In this corrected code, the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class is overridden, and the logic for handling holidays and business hours is re-implemented. The updated logic should handle holiday adjustments correctly and ensure that the specified number of periods is generated as expected.

Please note that this corrected code assumes that the logic within the `_apply_holiday_logic` method correctly handles holiday adjustments. It is advisable to conduct thorough testing to ensure the correction addresses the GitHub issue and resolves the original bug.
