Fixed code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if self.on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                elif self.on_offset(other):
                    if n >= 0:
                        while n > 0:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                            n -= 1
                    if n < 0:
                        while n < 0:
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                            n += 1

                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
