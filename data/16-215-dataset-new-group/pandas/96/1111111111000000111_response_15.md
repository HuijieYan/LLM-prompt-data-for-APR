Based on the provided buggy function, test case, and GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to the calculation of business hours when using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours, and adding holidays. The buggy function `apply` is used to calculate the adjusted date and time for custom business hours, but it fails to handle holidays appropriately.

The code fails when trying to generate a date range with custom business hours and holidays. When using the `pd.date_range` function with the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` frequency and specifying holidays, the resulting date range includes more periods than expected, causing the behavior to be unexpected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjust the date and time based on the business hour settings, as well as the provided holidays. We also need to ensure that the calculation of business hours and holidays is handled accurately to align with the user's expectations.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_date = other

        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while self._is_on_offset(adjusted_date) == False or adjusted_date in self.holidays:
                adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
        else:
            while adjusted_date.time() in self.start or adjusted_date in self.holidays:
                adjusted_date = adjusted_date - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            adjusted_date = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_date)

        # Handle business days adjustment
        if n != 0:
            business_day = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=n, business_hour=self)
            adjusted_date = adjusted_date + business_day

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have made changes to properly adjust the date and time based on the business hours, while also considering the provided holidays. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `pd.date_range` function should work properly when using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` frequency and specifying holidays, and should generate the expected date range with the correct number of periods and proper date and time adjustments.
