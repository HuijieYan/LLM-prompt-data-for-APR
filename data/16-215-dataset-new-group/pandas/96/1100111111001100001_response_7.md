The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object based on the conditions of `n` and `self._is_on_offset(other)`, leading to incorrect business hour calculations. 

The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a target datetime value by a certain number of business hours, given the start and end times of a custom business hour and any holidays. However, based on the failing tests, it seems that the adjustments are not being calculated accurately, leading to incorrect outputs.

A potential strategy to fix the bug would be to thoroughly review the logic used for adjusting the `other` datetime object and to ensure that the conditions for `n` and `self._is_on_offset(other)` are used correctly. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the related functions `self._next_opening_time`, `self._prev_opening_time`, and `self._get_closing_time` to ensure that they are functioning as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately adjust the `other` datetime value by the specified number of business hours and pass the failing test.
