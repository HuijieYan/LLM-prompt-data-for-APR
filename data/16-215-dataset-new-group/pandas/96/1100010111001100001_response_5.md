The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hour offset, but it fails to do so correctly, leading to failing tests.

The potential error locations are where the adjustments are made based on whether `n` is positive or negative, and the handling of the business hours left in each business time interval.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustments made to the datetime are not correctly updating the date and time to align with the business hours.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values and ensure that the datetime is updated to align with the business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected function handles adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values and ensures that the datetime is correctly adjusted to align with the business hours.
