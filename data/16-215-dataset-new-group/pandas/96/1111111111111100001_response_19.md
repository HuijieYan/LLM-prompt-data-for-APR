The cause of the bug is related to the calculation of the `other` variable within the `apply` function, which is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function is intended to calculate the next business hour by adjusting the given time based on the business hours and business days. However, it fails due to incorrect calculations, causing the failing test cases.

The issue seems to be with the adjustment of the `other` variable when assigning the adjusted opening time and closing time based on the business hour. The calculations for moving to the next business time interval are not being performed accurately.

To fix the bug, we need to rework the logic for adjusting the `other` variable to move to the next business time intervals and to ensure that the calculated adjustments align with the expected business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` class:

```python
class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessHourMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(bh_start, bh_end)
                for bh_start, bh_end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            if n >= 0:
                business_time_left = (self._get_closing_time(other) - other).seconds
                business_time_adjusted = min(n * 60 * 60, business_time_left)

                while business_time_adjusted > 0:
                    other = other + timedelta(seconds=business_time_adjusted)
                    business_time_adjusted = 0
            else:
                business_time_left = (other - self._prev_opening_time(other)).seconds
                business_time_adjusted = min(abs(n * 60 * 60), business_time_left)

                while business_time_adjusted > 0:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=business_time_adjusted)
                    business_time_adjusted = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version, the `other` variable is adjusted based on the remaining business hours, ensuring that it aligns with the expected business hours.

By implementing this fix, the corrected `apply` function should now pass the failing test cases and function as intended.
