The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect results in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and is related to an issue posted on GitHub titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday." The bug results from the lack of proper handling of the `holidays` parameter in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The issue is that the `apply` function does not properly adjust the business hours when holidays are included, leading to incorrect results and unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range`.

The cause of the bug is the improper handling of holidays within the `apply` function, as observed from the failing test cases. When holidays are introduced, the function does not correctly adjust the business hours, leading to inappropriate datetime indexing in the output.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly handle the holidays and adjust the business hours accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if other in self:
            return other

        holidays = self.holidays
        if holidays:
            holidays = pd.to_datetime(holidays)

        next_closest_bhour = self._next_opening_time(other)
        while True:
            bhour = next_closest_bhour
            start_bhour = self._prev_opening_time(bhour)

            if bhour <= other:
                if bhour == other or (start_bhour <= other and bhour > other):
                    break

            if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.weekday() not in [5, 6] and (holidays is None or other not in holidays):
                break

            if n < 0:
                other = start_bhour - timedelta(1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.weekday() not in [5, 6] and (holidays is None or other not in holidays):
                    break
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                if start_bhour == other and (holidays is None or other not in holidays):
                    other = bhour
                    break
                other = self._next_opening_time(bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The modified function has logic to properly handle the holidays and adjust the business hours, ensuring that the datetime indexing is correct when holidays are present.

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
