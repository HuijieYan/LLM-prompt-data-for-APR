The buggy function is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The issue is related to the behavior of the `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for adjusting the business hours and other time intervals might be incorrect, leading to an incorrect number of periods.
2. The adjustment of business days when handling negative offsets may be causing the incorrect number of periods.

The GitHub issue indicates that when using periods and adding holidays with the `date_range` function, it produces more periods than expected. This suggests that the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly handling the addition of holidays when calculating the intervals, leading to an incorrect number of periods.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and hours should be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the handling of holidays should be integrated into the logic to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when adding holidays.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of business days and hours is handled with explicit checks for holidays to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when adding holidays. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
