The bug in the given function seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours provided. After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the calculations for adjusting the date and time are not working as expected, leading to incorrect results.

The primary issues appear to be in the calculation of the business hours, adjustment by business days, and the remaining business hours to adjust. Additionally, the logic for handling the adjustment of business hours based on the direction of adjustment (positive or negative) seems to be problematic.

To fix the bug, one strategy could be to carefully review and re-implement the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. This could involve revisiting the calculations for business hours, the adjustment by business days, and the remaining business hours to adjust. Also, the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the direction of adjustment needs to be revised.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Convert other into a datetime object
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        
        # Adjust other based on business hours and business days
        if self.n >= 0:
            adjusted_time = self.adjust_time_for_positive_n(other)
        else:
            adjusted_time = self.adjust_time_for_negative_n(other)
            
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def adjust_time_for_positive_n(self, other):
    # Business hours
    business_hours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600 + (self.end[0].minute - self.start[0].minute) * 60
    
    # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
    total_seconds = abs(self.n) * 60
    business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(total_seconds, business_hours)
    
    # Adjust by business days first
    adjusted_time = other + timedelta(days=business_days)
    
    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    adjusted_time += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
    
    return adjusted_time

def adjust_time_for_negative_n(self, other):
    # Business hours
    business_hours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600 + (self.end[0].minute - self.start[0].minute) * 60
    
    # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
    total_seconds = abs(self.n) * 60
    business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(total_seconds, business_hours)
    
    # Adjust by business days first
    adjusted_time = other - timedelta(days=business_days)
    
    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
    
    return adjusted_time
```

The corrected version of the function includes separate methods for adjusting the datetime object based on the positive and negative values of `self.n`. The calculation of business hours, adjustment by business days, and the remaining business hours to adjust have been improved based on the identified issues.
