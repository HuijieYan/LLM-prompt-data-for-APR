## Correction

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly calculating the business hours and makes adjustments based on business hours. To address the issue, we need to analyze and modify the logic in the function. Based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the function is not functioning as expected when dealing with periods and adding holidays.

The corrected version of the function below should properly handle periods, holidays, and the calculation of business hours.

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from pandas import offsets

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        ...
        # existing logic
        ...

        if isinstance(self, offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
            # Calculate number of business hours between two business times
            freq = offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
            business_hours = pd.date_range(start=other, end=other + timedelta(days=1), freq=freq)
            business_hours_count = len(business_hours)

            # Adjust the number of periods based on business hours
            if self.n > 0:
                final_other = other + timedelta(hours=business_hours_count * self.n)
            else:
                final_other = other - timedelta(hours=business_hours_count * abs(self.n))
            return final_other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have added logic to calculate the number of business hours between two business times and adjusted the number of periods based on the business hours. This should ensure that the function works properly with periods and holidays, resolving the GitHub issue.
