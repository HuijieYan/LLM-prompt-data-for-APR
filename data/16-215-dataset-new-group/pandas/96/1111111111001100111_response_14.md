The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has a few potential issues. It seems like the he calculation of the next business day and the handling of business hours are not accurate. Additionally, the adjustments for business days are not correctly implemented.

The buggy function has several issues, such as:
- Improper handling of business days and hours
- Incorrect comparison and adjustment of the business days
- Inaccurate adjustment of business hours within a time interval
- Inappropriate handling of the input types and values

The observation leads to the conclusion that the buggy function has incorrect adjustments for the next open and closing time in relation to business hours, which leads to the wrong output. This can be fixed by accurately computing the business days and business hours and adjusting the datetime object accordingly.

A possible issue could be that the adjustment for the next business day `self.next_bday` isn't being called in a properly structured way which is signified by the error message `AttributeError: 'CustomBusinessHour' object has no attribute 'is_on_offset'` observed in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for the adjustments needs to be revisited. Additionally, the comparison and calculations need to be made on adjusted datetime objects to handle the business days and business hours properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions omitted for brevity

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            if n < 0:
                business_hours = -business_hours
    
            offset = self.next_bday.rollforward if n > 0 else self.next_bday.rollback
            other += n * offset
    
            seconds = n * 60 * 60 * business_hours
            return other + timedelta(seconds=seconds)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version should handle the adjustments for business days and business hours correctly based on the observed behavior and failing tests.
