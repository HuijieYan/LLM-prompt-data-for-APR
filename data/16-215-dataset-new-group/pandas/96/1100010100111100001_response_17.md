The bug in the provided `apply` function seems to be related to the timestamp processing logic, where the function is unable to handle the given input and throws a `ValueError` during certain conditions. The core issue could be in the logic for adjusting business hours and calculating the opening/closing times.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function and ensure that it correctly handles specific edge conditions and cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for higher business hours
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjust for lower business hours
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and focuses on properly adjusting the business hours based on the specified conditions. This should address the `ValueError` being raised and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the given test cases.
