The buggy function `apply` is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when adding holidays. The key issue is that the generated date range is incorrect and contains more dates than expected when using the `periods` parameter along with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.

The primary problem lies in the logic of adjusting the `other` datetime based on business hours and the presence of holidays. The `apply` function, which adjusts the input datetime to align with business hours, may be incorrectly handling the adjustment when holidays are present, resulting in the generation of excess periods in the date range.

To address this issue, the following strategy is proposed for fixing the bug:
1. Review and refactor the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and ensure that the generated date range aligns properly with business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BaseOffset
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    n = self.n
    other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

    # Adjust time to next opening if outside business hours
    if n >= 0 and (other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    elif n < 0 and other.time() not in self.start:
        # Adjustment to move to previous business day
        other = other - timedelta(days=1)

    while n >= 0 and other.time() in self.end or n < 0 and other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)

    return other
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are applied to the input datetime based on business hours, ensuring that it aligns properly with the specified frequency. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for generating date ranges with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays.
