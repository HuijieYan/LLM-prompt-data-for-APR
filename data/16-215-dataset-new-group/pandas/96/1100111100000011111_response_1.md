The buggy function has multiple issues with handling the input parameters and performing the necessary date adjustments. The problematic code part is in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function seems to contain logic to adjust the given datetime based on business hours, holidays, and other factors. However, the function is excessively convoluted and difficult to comprehend due to its complexity.

The buggy function appears to incorrectly calculate the adjusted datetime when holidays are included, leading to unexpected behavior in the output.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to simplify and clarify the logic in the `apply` method. This can be done by carefully analyzing the calculation and comparison logic used to adjust the datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method that should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
# Assume the necessary import statements

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other methods ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60, businesshours//60)
            
            if r < 0:
                r += businesshours//60
                bd -= 1
            
            adjusted_datetime = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)

            remaining_secs = r * 60
            while remaining_secs > 0:
                next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(next_open_time)
                time_interval = closing_time - adjusted_datetime

                if remaining_secs < time_interval.total_seconds():
                    adjusted_datetime += timedelta(seconds=remaining_secs)
                    remaining_secs = 0
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime = next_open_time
                    remaining_secs -= time_interval.total_seconds()

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version applies simplification and restructuring of the logic to ensure the calculation and adjustments are more manageable and consistent. The revised implementation should meet the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
