The buggy function `apply` has several bugs that need fixing. The function is designed to adjust a given date and time (`other`) according to certain business hours and rules. However, it currently fails to handle the adjustments in the correct manner and returns incorrect results.

The bugs in the `apply` function are causing it to produce incorrect results and fail the provided test, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

Bugs in the function:
1. Improper handling of business days adjustment (`skip_bd`) logic which is leading to miscalculation of return values based on `other` datetime.
2. Incorrect handling of the remaining business hours to adjust (`bhour_remain`).
3. Incorrect adjustment of the next business time interval on negative business hours (`n`).

To fix the bugs, we need to update the `apply` function as follows:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... [existing code remains unchanged]

            # remainder of the function goes here
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = min(
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other,
                        bhour_remain
                    )
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = min(
                        self._next_opening_time(other) - other,
                        bhour_remain
                    )
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0 or nanosecond != 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the bugs in the `apply` function should be resolved and the function should now correctly calculate adjustments based on business hours and rules. Additionally, it should pass the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and satisfy all the expected input-output values.
