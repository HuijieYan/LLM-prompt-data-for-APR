The bug in the provided code causes a ValueError to be raised. Based on the error message and the runtime values of the variables, it appears that the bug arises from the calculation of the business hours and the adjustment of the datetime object.

The buggy function attempts to adjust the given timestamp according to business hours. It calculates the number of business days and remaining business hours for the adjustment. However, there are issues with how it handles the adjustments and loop iterations, leading to incorrect results and the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, you need to review the logic for adjusting the datetime object according to business hours. Make sure that the adjustment for business days and remaining hours is correctly handled, and the loop iterations are properly structured.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By reviewing the adjustment logic and loop iterations, the corrected function should handle the adjustments of the datetime object to align with business hours, resolving the ValueError issue.
