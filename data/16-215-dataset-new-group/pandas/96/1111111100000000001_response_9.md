The potential errors in the buggy function could be related to the logic used for adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The code seems very complicated and hard to follow, making it challenging to identify the exact cause of the bug.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve simplifying the logic and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This would make it easier to identify and debug any issues. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the expected behavior and the inputs would be necessary to ensure that the corrected function meets the intended requirements.

Here's a potential corrected version of the function, assuming the intended behavior is to adjust a datetime based on business hours:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if self.n >= 0:
            return self._calculate_next_business_hour(other)
        else:
            return self._calculate_previous_business_hour(other)

    def _calculate_next_business_hour(self, other):
        while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() not in self.start:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
        return other

    def _calculate_previous_business_hour(self, other):
        while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() not in self.end:
            other -= timedelta(hours=1)
        return other
```
