The buggy function has an issue with the calculation of business hours. It uses comparisons and adjustments on the `other` input parameter, which causes incorrect results, resulting in the failing test cases.

The main problem is that when adjusting the `other` timestamp to account for business hours and days, the implementation is incorrect, causing the `other` timestamp to be modified in an unexpected way. This leads to incorrect behavior, as evident from the failing test cases.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to re-implement the logic for adjusting the `other` timestamp to correctly account for business hours and days. Additionally, ensure that the adjustments maintain expected behavior and accurately handle cases involving positive and negative values for the `n` attribute of the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjusting the input datetime based on CustomBusinessHour logic
        adjusted_datetime = self.apply_custom_business_hours(other)
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
def apply_custom_business_hours(self, other):
    adjusted_datetime = other
    n = self.n

    # Adjust the other datetime to reduce the number of cases to handle
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
            adjusted_datetime = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

    # Adjusting total business hours by seconds in one business day
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            remain = adjusted_datetime - prev_open
            adjusted_datetime = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            adjusted_datetime = adjusted_datetime + skip_bd

    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)) - adjusted_datetime
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # Finish adjusting if possible
                adjusted_datetime += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # Go to the next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + bhour)
    else:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime
            if (
                bhour_remain > bhour
                or bhour_remain == bhour
                and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
            ):
                # Finish adjusting if possible
                adjusted_datetime += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # Go to the next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._next_opening_time(
                        adjusted_datetime + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
                )

    return adjusted_datetime
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the adjustments of the `other` datetime accurately and pass the failing test cases.
