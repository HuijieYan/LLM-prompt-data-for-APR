The bug in the given function is caused by incorrect date and time adjustments when applying a custom business hour offset to a given datetime index. The 'apply' function seems to incorrectly modify the input 'other' date and time variable and fails to calculate the adjusted time properly. This leads to incorrect results and, in turn, a failing test.

To fix the bug in the given function, the logic for adjusting the business hour should be corrected to accurately apply the custom business hour offset to the datetime index.

Here's a corrected version of the 'apply' function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust date and time based on business hours
        adjusted = self.shift(other)

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the 'apply' function uses the 'shift' method to apply the custom business hour offset to the given datetime index. The 'shift' method accurately adjusts the date and time based on business hours and returns the adjusted datetime object.

With this correction, the 'apply' function is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
