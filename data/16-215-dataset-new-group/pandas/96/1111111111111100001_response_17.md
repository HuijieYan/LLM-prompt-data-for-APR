After analyzing the buggy function and examining the runtime input/output values and types, it appears that there are several issues with the function. 

The primary cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the business date and hours within the `apply` function. There are multiple conditions and loops that manipulate the `other` datetime object, as well as conditions related to business hours and days, which are not being processed correctly.

To fix the bug, the calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function need to be thoroughly reviewed and refined to ensure proper handling of business hours and days, as well as the business date increments and decrements. Additionally, the condition to handle edge cases for `other` dates needs to be more accurately implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        total_minutes = abs(n) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle the business hour and day increments and decrements more accurately, addressing the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
