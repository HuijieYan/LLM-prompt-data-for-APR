### Analysis and Identification of Potential Error Locations:
The issue appears to be related to calculating the date range when using periods and adding holidays. The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is `apply`, which is used to adjust the datetime based on the business hour.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Calculation of business hours using the `_get_business_hours_by_sec` method.
2. Adjusting the business day and remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments in the `apply` method, which leads to erroneous results when calculating the date range with periods and holidays. Specifically, the calculation of business days and remaining business hours based on the provided input `n` and `other` datetime is not handled correctly, causing the unexpected behavior.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are accurately implemented. It's also important to validate the handling of holidays when calculating the date range.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
        
        # Check for holidays
        if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            # If the given datetime is a holiday, adjust it to the next business day
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            return other

        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, additional handling for holidays is included to ensure that the adjusted datetime accounts for holidays when calculating the date range. The remaining code structure remains unchanged to maintain the original logic.

Note: The corrected version assumes that the `_next_opening_time` method correctly handles the adjustment to the next business day when the given datetime falls on a holiday. If not, appropriate adjustments should be made in the respective methods.
