Based on the expected values and types of variables, there are issues with the calculation of `bd` and `bhour_remain` in the buggy function. Therefore, we need to fix the calculation of these two variables.

The `bd` and `bhour_remain` should be calculated using integer division and the modulus of the `n * 60` by `businesshours // 60`, respectively. Additionally, further adjustments may be needed based on the remainder of `n * 60` after integer division to ensure the correct calculation.

Here's the correct version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # movement between business days
        if bd != 0:
            # movement to the next or previous BusinessDay
            business_day_movement = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            remain_on_day = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if remain_on_day != timedelta(0) and not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # move to the next BusinessDay
                other = self._next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + business_day_movement - remain_on_day

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain, bhour_per_day = divmod(abs(r), 60)
        if n < 0:
            bhour_remain, bhour_per_day = -bhour_remain, -bhour_per_day

        # positive case
        if bhour_per_day != 0:
            # fix the sign of the remaining hours
            bhour_remain += 24 * bhour_per_day
            if bhour_remain >= businesshours:
                # remove the extraneous days added to the hours
                additional_days, bhour_remain = divmod(bhour_remain, businesshours)
                other = self._next_bday.apply(other - timedelta(days=additional_days))

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values during the failing test execution.
