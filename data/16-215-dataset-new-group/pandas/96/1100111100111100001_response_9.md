The bug in the given function is likely to stem from incorrect business hour calculation, which affects the actual time value, leading to a ValueError in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting `other` based on business hours should be carefully reviewed and potentially re-implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        start = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
        end = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0])
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() > end.time() or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + timedelta(days=1)
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
        else:
            if other.time() == start.time():
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0])
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0])

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases provided and verify that it passes all of them.
