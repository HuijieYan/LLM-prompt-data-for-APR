The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the logic of adjusting the input `other` datetime based on business hours. Based on the provided runtime input values and types of variables, it is identified that the calculation and adjustments for the business days and remaining business hours are not effectively handling the cases.

The primary issues observed in the code are:
1. Adjustments for business days are not handled correctly for negative `n` values.
2. The logic for adjusting remaining business hours is not effectively updating the `other` datetime.

To fix the bug, the following strategy is suggested:
- Refactor the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours based on the value of `n`.
- Ensure that the adjustments for business days are accurate for both positive and negative `n` values.
- Update the logic for adjusting remaining business hours to correctly update the `other` datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            business_time_remaining = other - self._get_closing_time(other)  # Time remaining in the current business day
            business_days_skipped, remaining_time = divmod(n * business_hours, 60)
            if remaining_time > business_time_remaining.total_seconds() // 60:
                business_days_skipped += 1
                remaining_time -= business_time_remaining.total_seconds() // 60
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other + timedelta(days=business_days_skipped)) + timedelta(minutes=remaining_time)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= self.next_bday
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(minutes=1))
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            business_time_remaining = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)  # Time remaining in the current business day
            remaining_time = business_hours + (other - self._prev_opening_time(other)).total_seconds() // 60
            while remaining_time >= business_hours:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                remaining_time -= business_hours

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, as well as handling the negative `n` values properly, these changes should address the identified issues and fix the bug in the `apply` function.
