The bug in the function is causing incorrect calculations and adjustments to the input datetime value. This can be seen by the discrepancy between the actual output and the expected output from the failing test. The buggy function `apply` is part of a class `BusinessHourMixin`, and takes `self` and `other` as parameters. The function seems to be designed to handle the business hour offset for a given datetime, but due to several conditional statements and calculations, it fails to produce the expected output.

The potential errors in the function can be attributed to the incorrect application of logic in determining the adjustments needed for the given business hours offset. The use of conditionals and calculations to handle positive and negative offsets might be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to refactor the logic and calculations within the function to ensure that adjustments for positive and negative offsets are accurately applied. This may involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the datetime for business days and hours, as well as correcting any discrepancies in the adjustment calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handling edge conditions
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate business hours
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrections, the function should now produce the expected outputs for the failing tests and correctly handle the business hours offset.
