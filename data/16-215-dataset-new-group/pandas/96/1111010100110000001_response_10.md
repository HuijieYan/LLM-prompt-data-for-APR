The bug in the given function is causing the ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH. This is because the apply function is trying to adjust the business hours to a new date, but the method for adjusting the business hours has a bug that prevents it from properly handling the input date and calculating the adjusted business hours. 

To fix the bug, the code needs to be refactored to properly handle the adjustment of business hours and ensure that the adjusted date conforms to the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other.time()):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary calculations and checks that were causing the adjustment logic to break and fail to conform to the passed frequency. The adjustments for business hours are now properly handled, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
