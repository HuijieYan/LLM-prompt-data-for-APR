The buggy function contains a typo, which leads to incorrect date calculations when using the `CustomBusinessHour` function with holidays in the `date_range` method. This results in additional periods being added to the date range.

The bug is caused by the typo in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function fails to properly adjust the date when the business hour is combined with datetime. This leads to unexpected results, including additional periods in the output of the `date_range` method, as reported in the GitHub issue. 

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic inside the `apply` function to ensure that the adjustment of the date based on the business hour is accurate and does not produce unexpected results.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the logic in the `apply` function, we can ensure that the adjustment of the date based on the business hour is accurate and does not produce unexpected results, as reported in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the issue and make the `date_range` method work correctly with the `CustomBusinessHour` function and holidays.
