The bug in the provided function is likely causing the `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected when holidays are added. The `apply` function from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for modifying the datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The function is expected to adjust the datetime object to the next or previous business day based on the provided parameters. However, it seems to have logic issues that are causing it to generate unexpected results when used in conjunction with the `pd.date_range` function and holidays.

The `apply` function appears to have several logic issues that are likely causing the problem. The issues include incorrect handling of business day adjustments, incorrect handling of holidays, and lack of proper adjustment for business hours. These issues are causing the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly handle business day adjustments, holidays, and business hours. Additionally, the interaction of the `apply` function with other related functions from the same file should be reviewed to ensure consistency and correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            # Check if the datetime is on the end time, or not on the offset
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business day adjustments
        if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + BusinessDay(n=n)

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(n) % 60)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self._prev_opening_time(other), self._get_closing_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function is modified to properly handle business day adjustments and business hour calculations. The logic is aligned with the expected behavior when adjusting datetimes based on business hours and holidays.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread where `pd.date_range` produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays in conjunction with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
