The buggy function is intended to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset to a given timestamp. However, there are multiple issues with the code, including logical errors, incorrect variable usage, and failure to handle specific edge cases. The primary cause of the bug is the mismanagement of dates, times, and business hours calculations.

There are several potential strategies to fix the bug:
1. Update the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
2. Ensure that the correct business hour adjustments are made based on the input timestamp and the specified offset.
3. Improve the handling of edge cases when the offset goes beyond regular business hours or spans across multiple business days.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

class BusinessHourMixin:

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # Adjust for CustomBusinessHour
            n = self.n
            if n < 0:
                n = -n
                other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)  # Adjust for time just before start
            
            bd, bhour_remain = divmod(n * 60, 120)  # 120 minutes in a CustomBusinessHour
            if n < 0:
                bd, bhour_remain = -bd, -bhour_remain
                
            while bd > 0:
                other += CustomBusinessDay().apply(other)
                bd -= 1
            
            while bhour_remain > 0:
                next_opening = CustomBusinessHour().apply(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = 0
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = next_opening
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version of the function, the adjustments for business days and business hours have been simplified and corrected. The correct logic is applied based on whether the input offset is positive or negative, and the while loops iteratively adjust the timestamp based on the business days and remaining business hours.

This corrected version should address the issues and enable the function to pass the failing tests.
