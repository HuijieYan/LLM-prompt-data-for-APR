Looking at the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems like the bug lies in the apply_wraps function, specifically in the code that adjusts 'other' to the next opening time and then to the closing time. This adjustment process seems to be producing incorrect output, leading to the ValueError.

The current logic inside the buggy apply function has issues in adjusting dates and times, leading to incorrect results. The adjustment to the next opening time and closing time does not seem to be working as expected, leading to unexpected behavior in date_range when there are holidays.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting 'other' to the next opening time and the closing time. We should carefully consider the 'self.n' value and the logic for adjusting the date and time.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    n = self.n

    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            return self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            return self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

    return other
```

This revision simplifies the logic and directly produces the corrected adjusted time based on 'self.n' and the respective start and end times.

This revised version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
