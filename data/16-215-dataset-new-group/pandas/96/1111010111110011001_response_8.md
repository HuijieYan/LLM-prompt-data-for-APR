The bug in the original function seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation of business days and hours. The function sometimes outputs incorrect values that don't align with the expected output. This leads to a failure in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

By reviewing the code, the issue could be with the time-related adjustments as well as the handling of business days and business hours. 

To fix the buggy function, it's necessary to correctly handle the cases involving business days and hours. More specifically, it is important to accurately calculate business days, adjust for business days and handle business hours properly. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the correct function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            n = self.n
    
            # handle the cases for n >= 0 and n < 0
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get the total business hours by seconds in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                # use BusinessHourMixin here instead of BusinessDay
                skip_bd = BusinessHourMixin(holidays=self.holidays, start=self.start, end=self.end, n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correction the business day and business hour-related calculations, and with the addition of correct adjustments, the new version of the function is expected to satisfy the expected test cases and pass the failing test.
