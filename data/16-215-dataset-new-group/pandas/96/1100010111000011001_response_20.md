The buggy function receives two parameters, `other` and `self`, where `other` is a datetime object and `self` contains additional information such as business start and end times. The function is supposed to apply the business hour offset to the given datetime.

The potential errors within the buggy function are in the calculations that adjust the input `other` to account for the business hour offset. The implementation uses multiple while loops, conditional checks, addition and subtraction of timedelta objects, and calculations related to business days and remaining business hours. This complexity makes it difficult to identify the exact cause of the bug without further context on the expected behavior.

The failing test is related to custom business hours and holidays, and it expects a specific set of datetime values based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully review and debug the calculations in the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly adjusts the given datetime according to the business hours as specified in the case of `CustomBusinessHour`.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        bd, r = divmod(self.n*60, 60)  # calculate business days and remaining minutes

        adjust_days = timedelta(days=bd)
        adjust_minutes = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # apply business days adjustment
        other = other + adjust_days

        # apply remaining minutes adjustment
        if self.n >= 0:
            # if positive business hours
            while adjust_minutes > timedelta(0):
                closing_time = max(t for t in self.end if t <= other.time())
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                minutes_in_interval = (next_opening - other).seconds // 60
                if adjust_minutes <= minutes_in_interval:
                    other = other + timedelta(minutes=adjust_minutes)
                    adjust_minutes = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = next_opening
                    adjust_minutes -= minutes_in_interval
        else:
            # if negative business hours
            while adjust_minutes > timedelta(0):
                opening_time = min(t for t in self.start if t >= other.time())
                prev_closing = self._prev_closing_time(other)
                minutes_in_interval = (other - prev_closing).seconds // 60
                if adjust_minutes <= minutes_in_interval:
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=adjust_minutes)
                    adjust_minutes = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = prev_closing
                    adjust_minutes -= minutes_in_interval

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments for business days and remaining minutes are calculated and applied separately. The `while` loops are used to iteratively adjust the given datetime as per the business hour offset, ensuring that individual intervals are correctly handled. Additionally, the specific start and end times are used for adjusting the given datetime.
