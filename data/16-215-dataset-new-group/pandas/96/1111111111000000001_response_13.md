The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is attempting to adjust a datetime based on business hours and days, but it has several issues that cause it to fail.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statements for adjusting `other` based on `n` (the adjustment number) and whether it's positive or negative.
2. Calculations involving business days, remaining business hours, and adjusting the datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days, resulting in incorrect output for certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to reimplement the logic for adjusting the datetime to ensure that it correctly reflects the business hours and days.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) / 3600 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours)

        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version should resolve the issues and pass the failing test.
