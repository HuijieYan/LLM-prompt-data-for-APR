The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the adjustment of the variable `other` in certain cases when calculating business hours with dates. The adjustments made in the function using `skip_bd` and `bhour_remain` might not correctly handle the business hours, leading to unexpected output.

The GitHub issue describes how adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency results in producing more periods than specified. This is likely due to the improper handling of holidays and adjustments for business days and hours in the `apply` function.

To fix the bug, it's important to review the adjustment logic in the `apply` function and ensure that it correctly handles the calculation of business days and business hours with respect to holidays, start time, end time, and the number of periods specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the date is a holiday
        is_holiday = other in self.holidays

        if is_holiday:
            return self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time

        # Adjust the date and time according to the business hours
        other_date = other.date()
        opening_time = datetime.combine(other_date, self.start[0])
        closing_time = datetime.combine(other_date, self.end[0])

        if other < opening_time:
            return opening_time  # Move to the opening time

        if other >= closing_time:
            return self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time

        return other  # Return the same time when it's within business hours

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version overrides the `apply` function, ensuring that the adjustments and handling of holidays, business days, and business hours are done accurately. This should address the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
