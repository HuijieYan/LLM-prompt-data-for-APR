The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is that it incorrectly handles the adjustment of business hours, leading to the incorrect calculation of the result when using `CustomBusinessHour` in combination with date_range.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the business hours in the `apply` function to ensure it accurately handles the adjustment of business hours when combining `CustomBusinessHour` with datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        n = self.n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            curr_time = other.time()
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and curr_time not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_st, next_en = self._get_next_interval_start_end(other)
                bhour = next_st - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = next_st
        else:
            curr_time = other.time()
            next_time = self._get_closing_time(other).time()
            if curr_time in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other) or curr_time == next_time:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                next_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(next_start)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_st, next_en = self._get_next_interval_start_end(other)
                bhour = next_st - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    next_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_start)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected logic in the `apply` function accurately handles the adjustment of business hours based on whether the specified datetime is within business hours, and correctly accounts for adjustments when combining `CustomBusinessHour` with datetime.

With the corrected `apply` function, the failing test should now pass without any issues.
