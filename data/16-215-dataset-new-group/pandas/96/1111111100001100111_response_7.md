The issue seems to be related to the generation of incorrect time intervals when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours in the presence of holidays. The actual problem might be with the logic inside the `apply` function, which is causing the incorrect calculation of business day intervals.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the bug arises from the logic that calculates business day intervals in the `apply` function. Specifically, there are discrepancies in how business days are handled when adjusting for holiday periods and edge conditions.

The bug likely arises due to incorrect calculations related to handling business day intervals and holiday adjustments, resulting in an incorrect number of periods and unexpected time intervals.

To resolve this issue, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly adjust the business day intervals and handle holidays. This can be achieved by carefully reviewing the logic for adjusting business days, subtracting holidays, and ensuring that the correct business hours are accounted for.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import the correct functions and classes before declaring the corrected class

# Corrected class containing the fixed function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain unchanged...

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Apply fixing logic here
            if not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
                other = pd.Timestamp(other)
            
            n = self.n
            business_days = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays)
            new_date = other
            
            if n > 0:
                for _ in range(n):
                    new_date += business_days
            else:
                for _ in range(-n):
                    new_date -= business_days
            
            return new_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, adjustments are made to the `other` datetime object based on the value of `n` while correctly accounting for holidays. By using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay` class to handle business day intervals and ensuring that holidays are correctly subtracted, the corrected function resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

By updating the logic to handle business day adjustments and holidays accurately, the corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the reported issue, allowing `pd.date_range` to work as expected with custom business hours and holidays.
