The cause of the bug in the function `apply` from the class `BusinessHourMixin` is that the variables `other` and `n` are not being adjusted properly, and there are some logical errors within the function that prevent it from returning the expected values.

The buggy function `apply` takes a `self` parameter and an `other` parameter. It is meant to apply a business hour offset to the given timestamp and return the resulting timestamp. However, it fails to do so and raises a `ValueError` when run in the test cases provided.

### Issues:
1. The adjustments to the `other` variable based on the offset value `n` are causing incorrect results.
2. There are logical errors in the handling of business days and remaining business hours.
3. Variables such as `businesshours`, `bd`, `r`, `skip_bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` are not being computed correctly leading to incorrect adjustments to the `other` variable.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the `other` variable based on the offset value `n` in the correct manner according to business hours and days.
2. Fix the logical errors in handling business days and remaining business hours.
3. Ensure the correct computation of variables such as `businesshours`, `bd`, `r`, `skip_bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` to accurately adjust the `other` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (all other functions remain the same)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if self.n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the logical issues and computation errors, resulting in the function passing the failing tests.
