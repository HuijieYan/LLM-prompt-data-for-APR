Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime within the `apply` function. It appears that the logic for adjusting the time to the next or previous business day is faulty, leading to incorrect return values.

The buggy function `apply` seems to be aimed at adjusting a given datetime based on business hours and other rules like holidays. However, the logic used for adjusting the time to the next or previous business day, as well as the remaining business hours to adjust, seems to be incorrect. This results in the incorrect return values and subsequently fails the test.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays, as well as the logic for handling the next or previous business day, needs to be carefully re-evaluated and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_day = CustomBusinessDay(n=self.n)
        
        # Adjust to business time and holidays
        while True:
            if other.time() not in self.end:
                if other.weekday() < 5 and other not in self.holidays:
                    break
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
        
        # Adjust based on business days and business hours
        if n >= 0:
            other += business_day
            other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            while n > 0:
                other += CustomBusinessHour(1)
                n -= 1
        else:
            other -= business_day
            while n < 0:
                other -= CustomBusinessHour(1)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the given datetime based on business hours, holidays, and the rules for next or previous business days. It should now pass the failing test.
