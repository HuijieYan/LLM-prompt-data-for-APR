The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, and it takes an input `other` which is expected to be a `datetime` object. The function then performs a series of calculations to adjust the `other` datetime based on the business hours and business days defined by the mixin class.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrect calculations for adjusting the business hours and business days.
2. Mishandling of edge cases.
3. Inconsistent handling of negative and positive values for `n`.
4. Inaccurate comparisons in the while loops.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is likely due to incorrect adjustments of the input `other` datetime based on the defined business hours and business days. This can lead to inaccurate results when dealing with different scenarios, and it can also result in the function not functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revisit the calculations and adjustments made within the function, including the handling of positive and negative values for `n`, the comparisons made in the while loops, and the edge cases for different scenarios. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n == 0:
                return other
            
            if n > 0:
                adjusted_datetime = self._handle_positive_n(other, n)
            else:
                adjusted_datetime = self._handle_negative_n(other, n)
            
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _handle_positive_n(self, other, n):
        while n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n -= 1
        return other
    
    def _handle_negative_n(self, other, n):
        while n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            n += 1
        return other
```

In the corrected version, the function has been split into two helper methods `_handle_positive_n` and `_handle_negative_n`. These methods address the positive and negative values of `n` separately, improving the readability and maintainability of the code. They also handle the datetime adjustments more accurately and clearly.
