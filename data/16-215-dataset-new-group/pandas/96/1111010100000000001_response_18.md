The buggy function seems to be a part of a class that is related to business hours, with a mix-in to combine business hours with datetime objects.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be related to the date and time calculations, particularly when handling positive and negative business hours. The adjustment of business days and remaining business hours also seems to be a critical area where bugs might occur.

The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of business day adjustments, incorrect calculation of business hours, or a faulty logic in handling positive and negative business hour cases.

To fix the bug, one strategy could be to thoroughly review the logic for adjusting business days and business hours. Also, ensure that the calculations for adding or subtracting business hours are accurate and handle positive and negative hours appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours.total_seconds() // 60)  # corrected the businesshours calculation to use total_seconds()

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # corrected the comparison operator
                # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # corrected the comparison operator
                # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of business hours has been adjusted to use the `total_seconds()` method for accurate calculation. Moreover, the comparison operators for checking remaining time have been corrected to ensure the correct handling of business hour adjustments.
