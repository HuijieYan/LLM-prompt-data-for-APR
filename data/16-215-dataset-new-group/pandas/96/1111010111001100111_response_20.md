The issue with the buggy function `apply` is that there is a miscalculation when applying business hours and holidays. This results in unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with CustomBusinessHour and holidays, as described in the GitHub issue.

The issue arises from the incorrect handling of adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour. This leads to a discrepancy in the number of periods in `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic inside the `apply` function to correctly apply business hours in the presence of holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import DateOffset
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

# Assuming BusinessHourMixin and BusinessMixin are imported here...

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_hour_offset = CustomBusinessHour(
                start=self.start[0],
                end=self.end[0],
                holidays=self.holidays
            )
            new_datetime = other + n * business_hour_offset

            return new_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

With this corrected function, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expected to pass.
