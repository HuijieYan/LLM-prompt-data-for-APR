The bug in the `apply` function arises from logic related to adjusting business hours when working with datetimes, leading to incorrect results. To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business hours needs to be reviewed and corrected. It seems that there are issues with handling the business days and remaining business hours, leading to undesired results.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime values within the `apply` function needs to be revised to ensure that the correct adjustments are made based on the specified business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    # ... (other methods as per the original class)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n), business_hours_per_day // 60)

            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours
            
            adjusted_datetime = other
            if n > 0:  # Forward adjustment
                while business_days > 0:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_days -= 1
                
                remaining = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime
                if remaining_hours > 0 and remaining > timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours):
                    adjusted_datetime += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + remaining)
            else:  # Backward adjustment
                while business_days > 0:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_days -= 1
                
                remaining = adjusted_datetime - self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)
                if remaining_hours > 0 and remaining > timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours):
                    adjusted_datetime -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime + remaining)
            
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected logic handles both forward and backward adjustments for business days and remaining hours, ensuring that the output datetime is adjusted correctly based on the specified business hours.

This correction should result in the `apply` function producing the expected output for the provided test cases and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
