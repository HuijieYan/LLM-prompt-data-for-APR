The issue with the buggy function `apply` is that it's incorrectly calculating the adjusted date and time based on the holidays and other factors. This is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce incorrect output when custom business hours and holidays are used.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of adjusting dates when holidays are present, leading to the generation of more than the specified number of periods in `pd.date_range`.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve revisiting the logic for adjusting dates and times based on business hours, holidays, and periods. The adjustment should ensure that the output of `pd.date_range` aligns with the expected behavior, even when holidays are present.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour, apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_index_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        bd = n // self.n
        r = n % self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while bd != 0:
                next_bday = self.next_bday  # CustomBusinessDay
                other = next_bday.rollforward(other)
                bd -= 1

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if r != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            bhour_remain = bhour * r
            if n < 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_bday = self.next_bday  # CustomBusinessDay
                other = next_bday.rollforward(other + bhour_remain)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function resolves the bug that causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected when using custom business hours and holidays. This fix ensures that the adjusted date and time align with the expected behavior, even when holidays are present.
