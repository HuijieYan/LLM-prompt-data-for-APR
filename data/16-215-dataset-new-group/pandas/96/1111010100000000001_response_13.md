The buggy function `apply` is intended to perform some adjustments on a datetime object based on business hours and specific business time intervals. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function:

1. Incorrect reference to an attribute `next_bday` that is not defined anywhere within the function.
2. The condition checking for `nanosecond != 0` may cause issues as `nanosecond` might not be present in the `other` datetime object, leading to an AttributeError.
3. The logic within the while loops is complex and hard to follow, potentially leading to errors in handling the remaining business hours to adjust.

To fix these issues, we can use the following strategy:
1. Replace the reference to the non-existent `next_bday` attribute with a valid reference.
2. Use a safer way to access the `nanosecond` attribute to avoid AttributeError.
3. Simplify and clarify the logic within the while loops for adjusting the business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if skip_bd.apply(prev_open) != self._prev_opening_time(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = min(
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other,
                    bhour_remain
                )
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = min(
                    self._next_opening_time(other) - other,
                    bhour_remain
                )
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the reference to `next_bday` has been replaced with a more appropriate conditional check. The logic within the while loops has been simplified to ensure that the remaining business hours are adjusted correctly. Additionally, a safer way to access the `nanosecond` attribute has been used to avoid potential AttributeError issues.
