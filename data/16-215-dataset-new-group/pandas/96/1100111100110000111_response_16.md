Here's an explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This method aims to apply a CustomBusinessHour DateOffset to a datetime object, but it has several logical issues. One of the most evident issues is in the code segment where the `else` statement is used for handling negative offsets, resulting in incorrectly calculated dates. Furthermore, the strategy for adjusting the business days and remaining hours is not implemented correctly, leading to misleading results.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic of the `apply` method. It should correctly adjust the dates based on the given CustomBusinessHour DateOffset. Also, it should handle negative offsets properly, ensuring that the resulting dates are accurate.


```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin():
    # other methods

    # Fixed implementation of the apply method
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            start_time = (other.hour * 60 + other.minute)
            business_hours_start = (self.start.hour * 60 + self.start.minute)
            business_hours_end = (self.end.hour * 60 + self.end.minute)

            if n >= 0:
                if start_time >= business_hours_end or start_time < business_hours_start:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                    other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                                     self.start.hour, self.start.minute, 0, 0)
            else:
                if start_time > business_hours_start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                                     self.end.hour, self.end.minute, 0, 0)

            hours_to_adjust = abs(n) * ((business_hours_end - business_hours_start) // 60)

            if n < 0:
                remaining_business_hours = (business_hours_end - start_time) + (business_hours_start)
            else:
                remaining_business_hours = business_hours_end - start_time

            while hours_to_adjust > 0:
                if hours_to_adjust >= remaining_business_hours:
                    remaining_business_hours = business_hours_end - business_hours_start
                    other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                                     self.start.hour, self.start.minute, 0, 0)
                    hours_to_adjust -= remaining_business_hours
                    if n >= 0:
                        other += timedelta(days=1)
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=hours_to_adjust)
                    hours_to_adjust = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# The remaining functions and classes have been omitted for brevity, 
# but they should also be modified based on the fixed version of the BusinessHourMixin class.
