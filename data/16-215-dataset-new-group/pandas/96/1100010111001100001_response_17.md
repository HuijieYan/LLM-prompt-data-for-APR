The buggy function `apply` is part of the pandas library. It is intended to manipulate datetimes based on custom business days and business hours. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range using a custom business hour offset and expects certain datetime values in the output which are not being met.

After analyzing the runtime input/output variable values provided for the buggy function, it seems that the bug may be related to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on business hours and business days.

The bug likely arises due to the incorrect adjustment made to the `other` datetime while handling business hours and business days. This leads to discrepancies in the output datetimes, causing the failing test.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and days. It may involve re-evaluating the logic used to adjust the `other` datetime within the `apply` function, ensuring that it correctly aligns with the expected behavior for custom business hours and business days.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the likely issues causing the failures:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Business hour adjustment
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Business day adjustment
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        other = other + skip_bd

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the issues related to adjusting the `other` datetime based on business hours and business days should be resolved, and the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass.
