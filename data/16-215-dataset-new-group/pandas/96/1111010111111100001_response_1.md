The bug in the function `apply` causes errors while calculating the DateTimeIndex when using custom business hours with holidays. The values returned by the function are incorrect, leading to a ValueError when attempting to validate the frequency against the inferred frequency. This is evident from the error message indicating that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The faulty part of the code seems to be the business hour adjustment logic within the `apply` function that manipulates the `other` datetime for custom business hours with holidays. It miscalculates the business hours and day adjustments, leading to incorrect outputs and causing the subsequent validation failure.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the adjustment logic and the handling of business days and business hours within the `apply` function. It might require specific handling of holidays and business day adjustments for CustomBusinessHour offsets.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check for holidays and adjust other accordingly
            other = self.adjust_for_holidays(other)

            # Adjust business days first
            other = self.adjust_for_business_days(other)

            # Adjust the remaining business hours
            other = self.adjust_for_business_hours(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def adjust_for_holidays(self, other):
        # Handle holiday adjustments
        if other in self.holidays:
            # Adjust the other datetime
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        return other

    def adjust_for_business_days(self, other):
        # Handle business day adjustments
        # Adjust business days first
        if self.n > 0:
            other += np.busday_offset(other, self.n, roll='forward', weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
        elif self.n < 0:
            other += np.busday_offset(other, self.n, roll='backward', weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
        return other

    def adjust_for_business_hours(self, other):
        # Handle remaining business hours adjustments
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        remaining_minutes = self.n * 60
        return other + timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes * businesshours)
```

By separating the adjustments into different methods according to their purpose and ensuring proper adjustment for holidays, business days, and business hours, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected results.
