The buggy function `apply` contains logic to adjust dates based on business hours, but there are several potential error locations within this function. One potential cause of the bug could be that the logic to adjust business days and remaining business hours might not be accurate, leading to the incorrect adjustment of dates.

The error message indicates a validation error related to frequencies of business hours on dates. It references a specific frequency `CBH` that is not being correctly processed.

A potential strategy to fix the bug could involve reviewing the logic to adjust business days and remaining business hours, ensuring that the adjustment preserves the correct business frequencies.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # convert other to a datetime object
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
        business_offset = self
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = business_offset.rollforward(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            business_offset._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(business_offset.start, business_offset.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other = business_offset.apply_business_day_offset(other, bd, original_bhour_remain=timedelta(), offset=r)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        other = business_offset.apply_business_hour_offset(other, r, biz_day=bd)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function has been refactored to use the `rollforward` method to adjust dates based on business hours. The business day and remaining business hour adjustments have been revised in separate methods to improve clarity and maintainability.

After making these adjustments, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
