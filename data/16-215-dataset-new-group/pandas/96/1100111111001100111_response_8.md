The bug in the provided `apply` function is causing incorrect results in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, as reported in the GitHub issue. The bug is leading to additional periods being added when holidays are incorporated into the date range. 

The cause of the bug lies in the `apply` function's logic for adjusting the business hours and days with respect to the specified holidays. Specifically, the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and hours when raising or lowering business hour frequencies are leading to the unexpected results in the date range.

To fix this bug, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to correctly adjust business days and hours, accounting for the specified number of periods and holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# I'm providing a corrected version of the buggy apply function, based on the analysis of the issue and runtime input/output values.

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
          
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        if self.weekmask is None:
            self.update_weekmask()
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
          
        bdays = self.get_business_days(n)
        other += bdays[-1]
        
        if self.weekmask is not None:
            days = pd.DatetimeIndex(
                data=[other] + [other + timedelta(days = n * 7) for n in range(1, 6)],
                freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            )
            return days
        else:
            result = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, 
                other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
            )
            return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The revised `apply` function should address the issues causing incorrect results in the `pd.date_range` function after incorporating periods and holidays.

By implementing this fix, the buggy behavior is expected to be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
