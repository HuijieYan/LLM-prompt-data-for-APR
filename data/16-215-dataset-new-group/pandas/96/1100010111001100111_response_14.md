The code as given contains several logic errors causing the main problem in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, specifically within the `apply` method. The method is expected to compute the new business hours based on the input `other`, but it's resulting in incorrect outputs when holidays are involved. This issue leads to the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The cause of the bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` method of `CustomBusinessHour`. The logic to adjust the date to handle holidays and business hours within the method seems flawed, resulting in incorrect output. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour with a holiday and expects the output to include matching business hour periods, but the buggy code returns more periods than expected.

A potential strategy to fix this bug would involve reviewing and refining the logic within the `apply` method. A crucial change seems to involve adjusting the handling of holidays to ensure they are properly incorporated when computing new business hours. Additionally, it would be important to ensure that the method correctly calculates the business hours taking into account the given holidays and other relevant parameters.

The following corrected version of the `apply` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class aims to address the identified issues:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # check for holiday and adjust other accordingly
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_business_day(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_hours = self.n * len(self.end)
        # increment or decrement the business hour based on the value of self.n
        if self.n > 0:
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remaining_hours -= 1
        else:
            while remaining_hours < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._get_opening_time(other) - timedelta(hours=1)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining_hours += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refactoring the logic in this method, addressing the handling of holidays, and recalculating the remaining business hours, it's likely that the initial issue causing the failing test can be resolved. This allows the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to use the corrected `apply` method and execute without issue.
