The bug in the given function appears to be triggered by the logic for adjusting the input `other` based on the business hours and days. Based on the input parameters and the relevant variables, the buggy function seems to misinterpret the conditions for handling positive/negative values of `n`, the business day adjustment, and the remaining business hours adjustment.

The identified causes of the bug include:
1. Incorrect handling of different conditions based on the value of `n`.
2. Inaccurate adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.
3. Incorrect use of `self.next_bday` instead of calling the method `self.next_bday()`.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be implemented:
1. Adjust the conditions and logic for positive/negative values of `n` to accurately adjust the input datetime (`other`).
2. Correctly handle the business day adjustment within the `if n >= 0` and `if n < 0` blocks.
3. Replace `self.next_bday.is_on_offset()` with a method call `self.next_bday()` to check if the next business day immediately follows the input `other`.
4. Adjust the business hours within the while loops based on the remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the suggested fixes:
```python
# ... (other functions and class definitions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday(other):  # Fix - Correct method call
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # Fix - Correctly handle business hours in while loop
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other  # Fix - Adjust for the next opening time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour  # Fix - Adjust for the next opening time
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):  # Fix - Correctly handle business hours in while loop
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to previous business time interval
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - (bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

In the corrected version, the while loops now correctly handle the remaining business hours based on the business time intervals. The method call `self.next_bday(other)` is changed to properly invoke the method `self.next_bday()` to check if the next business day immediately follows the input `other`. Corrections are also made for handling negative `n` and adjusting the business days and hours accordingly.

The suggested fixes should address the issues identified based on the provided runtime values and types of variables.
