The bug causing the failing tests for the `apply` function lies in the implementation of the date adjustments within the function. Specifically, the bug appears to be linked to the handling of business days and business hours, causing the resulting adjusted date to be incorrect.

The nature of the bug suggests that the adjustment based on business days and business hours is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments and violated business hour constraints.

To fix the bug, the adjustment on the date related to business days and business hours needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            adjusted_date = other
            current_hour = other.hour
            current_minute = other.minute
            current_second = other.second
            current_microsecond = other.microsecond

            roll_to_next = False

            # Detect whether to roll to next business hour based on the current time
            if n >= 0:
                if current_hour == self.end[0].hour and current_minute >= self.end[0].minute:
                    roll_to_next = True
            else:
                if current_hour == self.start[0].hour and current_minute < self.start[0].minute:
                    roll_to_next = True

            # Roll the time to the next business hour
            while n != 0:
                if roll_to_next:
                    adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
                else:
                    adjusted_date = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_date)
                n -= 1

            return adjusted_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected `apply` function, the failing test cases should now pass without throwing the `ValueError` they were previously causing.
