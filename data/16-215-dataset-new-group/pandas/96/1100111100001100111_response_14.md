The bug in the `apply` function is likely causing the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The function is designed to adjust the timestamp by a certain custom business hour, but it seems to be adding incorrect periods when holidays are involved, leading to irregular behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic where it calculates and adjusts the business hours and adjusts the timestamp based on the business day. The calculation and adjustment logic for negative `n` values also seem to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is related to the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the business hours and days. It appears that the application of business day shifts when holidays are involved is causing unexpected behavior. The issue on GitHub also aligns with this suspicion, as it is related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the custom business hour frequency.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to thoroughly review and potentially re-implement the logic for adjusting the timestamps by the specified custom business hours, especially when holidays are involved. The logic for handling negative `n` values also needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    n = self.n
    nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
    other = datetime(
        other.year,
        other.month,
        other.day,
        other.hour,
        other.minute,
        other.second,
        other.microsecond,
    )

    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    if n != 0:
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other += skip_bd

        while r != 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
    return other
```

This version of the corrected function revises the logic for handling positive and negative `n` values and includes a more robust approach to adjusting the timestamps based on the custom business hours and days, addressing the potential issues causing the unexpected behavior.
