The buggy function `apply` has issues with adjusting business hours when dealing with a custom business hour frequency, leading to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function. The issue is related to the incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the custom business hour frequency correctly, resulting in the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. This causes `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results when holidays are added.

To fix the bug, the custom business hour frequency handling in the `apply` function needs to be revised to correctly adjust business days and remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function to fix the bug:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... [unchanged code]

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculation of business days and remaining business hours, the updated `apply` function should now resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and produce the expected output for `pd.date_range` when using custom business hour frequencies with holidays.
