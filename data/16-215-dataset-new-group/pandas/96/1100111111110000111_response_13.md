The buggy function has an issue with the way it handles holidays, leading to unexpected output and a `ValueError` when using periods and adding holidays. The GitHub issue also highlights that `pd.date_range` does not work as expected when using periods and adding holidays.

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it seems that the problem arises from the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The handling of holidays is causing the incorrect generation of date ranges.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle holidays while generating date ranges.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Retrieve the date from the datetime
        date_only = other.date()

        # Check if the date is a holiday
        if date_only in self.holidays:
            # Adjust the date to the next working day
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Process the date as before to handle business hours
        n = self.n
        # ... previous code remains unchanged ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if each date falls on a holiday and adjusts it accordingly before processing the date to handle business hours. This way, the `apply` function will correctly handle periods and holidays when generating date ranges.

With this fix, the `pd.date_range` function will work as expected when using periods and adding holidays, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
