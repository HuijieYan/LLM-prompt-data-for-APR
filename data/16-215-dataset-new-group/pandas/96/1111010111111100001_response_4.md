The issue appears to be related to the handling of business hours and the given frequency `CustomBusinessHour`. The code tries to adjust the input `other` datetime based on the business hours, and the error message indicates a failure in frequency validation.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, ensuring that it is compatible with the given frequency and that the adjusted datetime conforms to the frequency. Also, the section for generating a new range based on frequency might need to be revisited to ensure it aligns with the adjustments made to the datetime.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Reset minutes, seconds, and microseconds
            
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected version with various scenarios to ensure that it resolves the frequency validation issue and does not introduce any new bugs.
