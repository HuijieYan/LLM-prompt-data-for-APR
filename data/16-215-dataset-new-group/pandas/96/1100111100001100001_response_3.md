The buggy function seems to be related to business hours calculations and adjustments. It takes a `Timestamp` object `other` and an integer `n` as input, and then performs various adjustments on `other` based on the business hours defined in `self.start` and `self.end`.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for different cases, it seems that there are inconsistencies in the logic used for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours. The function is expected to adjust the input timestamp `other` based on the defined business hours and the value of `n`, but the adjustments may not work correctly in all scenarios.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves carefully revisiting the logic used for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, checking the conditions for adjusting the timestamps based on the business hours would be necessary. Inconsistencies in the handling of the positive and negative values of `n` should also be investigated.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Adjust other based on the sign of n and comparing with business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other += self.next_bday if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else BusinessDay(0)
            else:
                other -= self.next_bday if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else BusinessDay(0)
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_minutes = (abs(n * 60) % (business_hours // 60)) * (-1 if n < 0 else 1)
        other = self._adjust_remaining_time(other, remaining_minutes)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
def _adjust_remaining_time(self, dt, minutes):
    while minutes != 0:
        business_hour = self._get_business_hour_at_time(dt)
        
        if minutes > 0:
            minutes_left = (business_hour["end"] - dt).seconds // 60
            if minutes <= minutes_left:
                return dt + timedelta(minutes=minutes)
            else:
                minutes -= minutes_left
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt + timedelta(minutes=minutes_left))
        else:
            minutes_left = (dt - business_hour["start"]).seconds // 60
            if abs(minutes) <= minutes_left:
                return dt - timedelta(minutes=abs(minutes))
            else:
                minutes += minutes_left
                dt = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt))
    return dt
```

In this corrected version, I have split the adjustment logic into a separate method `_adjust_remaining_time` to handle the remaining business hours adjustment. The method takes the input timestamp `dt` and the remaining minutes to adjust, and then iteratively adjusts the timestamp based on the business hours.

The conditions for adjusting the timestamps based on business hours, as well as the adjustments for positive and negative values of `n`, have been updated to ensure correct behavior.

This corrected version should address the inconsistencies and potential errors in the original buggy function.
