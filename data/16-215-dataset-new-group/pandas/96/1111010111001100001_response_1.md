The buggy function has an issue where it fails to adjust the time correctly, especially when dealing with negative business hours and edge cases. The function tries to adjust the input datetime based on business hours, but it encounters problems in all the runtime scenarios provided which are causing the failing test.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle all possible edge cases and negative business hours correctly. It incorrectly adjusts the input datetime based on positive business hours without considering the adjustments needed for negative business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to reconsider the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, considering both positive and negative business hours and handling different edge cases more effectively.
