The function above needs to adhere to the expected values and types of variables for certain input and output values to be effective. Based on the error message from the failing test and the expected input/output values, there are several potential error locations within the buggy function. The bug causes it to generate incorrect `datetime` values.

The root cause of the bug is likely due to miscalculations and incorrect conditions when adjusting the `other` datetime object. For fixing the bug, the Business Hour class should be carefully re-implemented to adjust the given `datetime` by its business hours and business days. The logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours also needs to be reassessed and corrected.

Here is the revised version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        business_hours = (self.end - self.start).seconds / 3600
        adjusted_datetime = other

        if n > 0:
            while n > 0:
                date_time = adjusted_datetime + timedelta(days=1)
                adjusted_datetime = date_time.replace(
                    hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute
                )
                if adjusted_datetime.weekday() in [5, 6] or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                date_time = adjusted_datetime - timedelta(days=1)
                adjusted_datetime = date_time.replace(
                    hour=self.end.hour, minute=self.end.minute
                )
                if adjusted_datetime.weekday() in [5, 6] or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                    adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)
                n += 1

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the updated function, it should produce the correct `datetime` values, satisfying the expected input and output variable values.
