The buggy function `apply` has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The function modifies the `other` variable, potentially causing unexpected changes to the input.
2. There are multiple conditional branching blocks that manipulate the `other` variable, making it unclear how the variable is actually being adjusted.
3. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours is complex, and it can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Avoid modifying the original `other` timestamp object. Instead, use a separate variable to perform calculations and adjustments.
2. Simplify the conditional logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
3. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp object are consistent and correctly reflect the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        adjusted_time = other  # Create a separate variable to perform adjustments
        
        # Adjust for business days
        if self.n > 0:
            while self.n > 0:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    self.n -= 1
        elif self.n < 0:
            while self.n < 0:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    self.n += 1
        
        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=self.n * 60 / (businesshours // 60))
        
        return adjusted_time
```

With these changes, the `apply` function should correctly adjust the input timestamp based on the specified business hours and the `n` parameter. This should allow the function to pass the failing test case provided.
