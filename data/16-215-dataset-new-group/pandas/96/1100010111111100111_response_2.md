The buggy function `apply` is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. It is used in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The failing test produces an error related to inferred frequency that does not conform to the passed frequency. The issue reported on GitHub also relates to the behavior of the `date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

The potential error location in the `apply` function seems to stem from the implementation to adjust the timestamps based on business hours and holidays, leading to incorrect frequency validation and datetime range generation.

The cause of the bug seems to be the erroneous adjustment of the timestamp using business days and hours, which results in the incorrect date range being generated by the `date_range` function. This causes the failure in the test and results in the reported GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for adjusting timestamps to align with business hours and days, ensuring that the calculated timestamps are correctly aligned on business hours and holidays to produce the expected frequency validation and range generation.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if (
            not self._is_on_offset(other)
            or other.weekday() > 4
            or other.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") in self.holidays
        ):
            business_days = 0
            direction = 1 if self.n > 0 else -1
            while business_days < abs(self.n):
                other = other + timedelta(days=direction)
                if (
                    other.weekday() < 5
                    and other.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") not in self.holidays
                ):
                    business_days += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made to the input timestamps to align with business hours and holidays, ensuring that the date range is correctly generated by the `date_range` function.

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
