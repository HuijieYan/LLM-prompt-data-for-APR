The bug was causing incorrect behavior when using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and adding holidays. The issue was due to a combination of factors, including the use of `datetime`, the incorrect handling of holidays, and improper calculations. The corrected version includes a restructured and enhanced logic to address these issues.
