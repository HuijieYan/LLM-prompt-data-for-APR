The buggy function appears to be `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in pandas' offsets.py file. There are multiple instances of calling related functions such as `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_get_business_hours_by_sec` within the `apply` function. The function is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and days according to the given parameters.

The buggy function may have issues in correctly adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days, leading to incorrect results. This could be due to inaccurate checks and calculations within the function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime object within the `apply` function and verify the validity of each condition and calculation. The related functions it calls should also be reviewed to ensure they provide accurate results.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

...
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    ...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version applies the necessary adjustments to the `other` datetime object based on business hours and days according to the given parameters. It addresses issues that may have caused incorrect results in the buggy function.
