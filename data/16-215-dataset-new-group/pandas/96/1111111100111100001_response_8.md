Looking at the error message and the cases provided, it seems that the buggy function is not handling the custom business hour frequency correctly, resulting in a validation error. Let's analyze the potential cause of the bug, and suggest a strategy for fixing it based on the failing tests provided.

## Bug Analysis
1. The failing tests show that the buggy function is not handling custom business hours correctly when trying to adjust the datetime according to the business hour frequency.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to validate the frequency against the passed values, and it fails the validation test, resulting in a ValueError.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by an inaccurate adjustment of the input datetime value according to the custom business hour frequency and not handling edge cases effectively. This led to a mismatch between the frequencies inferred from the passed values and the one passed.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the datetime input is adjusted accurately based on the custom business hour frequency. This means handling edge cases and adjusting the datetime to the appropriate next or previous opening time.

Specifically:
1. Check whether the logic for adjusting the input datetime according to the custom business hour frequency is accurate and handles edge cases effectively.
2. Ensure that the adjustment considers potential holidays, next business days, and closing times.
3. Verify that the returned adjusted datetime aligns with the custom business hour frequency.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the buggy function based on the analysis and fix strategy.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Assuming the rest of the business hour mixin is correct

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    dt = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Convert to naive datetime
    n = self.n
    
    if n >= 0:
        while dt.time() not in self.start or self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt += timedelta(minutes=1)
    else:
        while dt.time() not in self.start or self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt -= timedelta(minutes=1)
    
    return dt
```

In this corrected version, we adjust the input datetime `other` based on the custom business hour frequency defined by `self`. We need to ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the start time of the business hours and is not on an offset. This should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
