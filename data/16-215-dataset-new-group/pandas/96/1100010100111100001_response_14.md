The buggy function is failing and throwing a ValueError when it is being invoked via the inheritance method `pd.date_range` with custom business hours.

The error is occurring because the `apply` method in the CustomBusinessHour class is not handling the cases properly.

The issue arises when the `apply` method tries to adjust the time using business hours, as it is not handling weekday and after-hours cases correctly. The logic within the `apply` method for adjusting business hours and the handling of business days seem to be incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic within the `apply` method, especially in the parts where it handles adjusting the business hours and business days. Additionally, the method should handle cases where the starting time is on a business hour and ending time is beyond the business hours.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening_time
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
              while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                  bhour = next_opening_time - other
                  if bhour_remain < bhour:
                      other += bhour_remain
                      bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                  else:
                      bhour_remain -= bhour
                      other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                  bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                  if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                      other += bhour
                      bhour_remain -= bhour
                  else:
                      bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the business day adjustment logic and the handling of business hours have been fixed and properly aligned with the CustomBusinessHour class's functionalities. This corrected version should resolve the ValueError issue.
