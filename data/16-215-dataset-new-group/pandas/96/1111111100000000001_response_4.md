The buggy function seems to be attempting to calculate business hours by taking into account different time intervals, business days, and adjusting for specific start and end times.

One potential error location is the comparison of time intervals and adjustment of the "other" datetime variable based on these comparisons. Another potential error location is in the handling of negative values for "n".

The cause of the bug might be related to incorrect calculations and comparisons within the function, leading to unexpected results or errors when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to carefully review each calculation and comparison within the function to ensure that the logic is correct and consistent. Specifically, checking the handling of negative values for "n" and ensuring that comparisons and adjustments of "other" are accurate based on business hours and intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjusted to reduce number of cases to handle
        n = self.n
        start_time = self.start[0]
        end_time = self.end[-1]
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), business_hours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_day = timedelta(days=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + business_day + remain
            else:
                other += bd * business_day
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        business_hour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while business_hour_remain != timedelta(0):
                b_hour = self._get_closing_time(start_time) - other
                if business_hour_remain < b_hour:
                    other += business_hour_remain
                    business_hour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    business_hour_remain -= b_hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour)
        else:
            while business_hour_remain != timedelta(0):
                b_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if business_hour_remain > b_hour:
                    other += business_hour_remain
                    business_hour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    business_hour_remain -= b_hour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments to the "other" datetime based on business hours, intervals, and business days have been revised to ensure the correct logic and comparisons are used. Additionally, the calculation and handling of negative values for "n" has been updated to address potential errors.
