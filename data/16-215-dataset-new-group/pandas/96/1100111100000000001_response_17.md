The issue with the buggy function is that it contains multiple nested loops and conditional statements, which make it difficult to follow and debug. The function may not be handling all edge cases correctly, and this complexity can lead to potential errors.

One potential bug is found in the conditional statement:
```
if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
```
It seems that there is a typo in this line, and it should be calling the method `is_on_offset` instead of `next_bday.is_on_offset`.

Another potential issue is the handling of the `bhour_remain` variable in both the `if` and `else` blocks. The conditions and comparisons can be simplified and made more readable.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the conditional statements and loops, addressing the potential typo in the method call, and improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements and loops have been simplified for better readability. The potential typo in the method call has been fixed, and the comparison of `bhour_remain` has been improved for accuracy.
