The buggy function is failing in the specific function call `pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)` due to the incorrect calculation of the next business hour's date. The behavior is causing the returned values to deviate from the expected output, leading to test failures. The cause of this issue is a miscalculation when determining the next business hour's date.

The bug is related to the incorrect logic used to handle business hours and adjusted business days. The function mishandles the ingress of positive or negative hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments. Additionally, it incorrectly calculates the next business day's holiday, leading to incorrect date calculations.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to refactor the algorithm that computes the adjusted business days and business hours. Also, the function should correctly check for holidays and adjust the date accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        delta = self.n * self.negative_multiplier
        next_business_hour = self._next_opening_time(other, delta)
        return next_business_hour
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
