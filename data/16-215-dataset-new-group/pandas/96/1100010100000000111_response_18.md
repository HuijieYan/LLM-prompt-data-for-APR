The buggy function `apply` is part of the source code of the `pandas` library, specifically in the `tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is intended to handle adjustments to business hours when combined with datetimes, like in the case of using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and optional holidays.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The calculation and adjustment of business days (`bd` and `skip_bd`).
2. Handling of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`).

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function does not correctly handle the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours when combined with datetime, resulting in unexpected behavior when using holidays with `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, we can utilize the integer division and modulo operations to handle business days more accurately and adjust the remaining business hours in a more robust manner, ensuring that the correct datetime is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # existing code remains intact
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        minutes_in_hour = 60
        seconds_in_minute = 60
        business_minutes = businesshours / seconds_in_minute
        
        # calculate business days and remaining business hours
        total_minutes = abs(self.n) * minutes_in_hour
        bd, bhour_remain_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, business_minutes)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, bhour_remain_minutes = -bd, -bhour_remain_minutes
        
        # handle adjustments for business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            next_bday = self.next_bday(other)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_bday
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # adjust remaining business hours
        if bhour_remain_minutes != 0:
            remaining_adjustment = timedelta(seconds=int(bhour_remain_minutes * seconds_in_minute))
            # determine if we need to move to the next business time interval
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time)
            remaining_business_minutes = closing_time - other
            if self.n >= 0:
                while remaining_adjustment.total_seconds() > 0:
                    if remaining_adjustment < remaining_business_minutes:
                        other += remaining_adjustment
                        remaining_adjustment = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_adjustment -= remaining_business_minutes
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_business_minutes)
                        remaining_business_minutes = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                while remaining_adjustment.total_seconds() > 0:
                    if remaining_adjustment > remaining_business_minutes or remaining_adjustment == remaining_business_minutes:
                        other += remaining_adjustment
                        remaining_adjustment = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_adjustment -= remaining_business_minutes
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_business_minutes - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                        remaining_business_minutes = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version takes into account more precise calculations for business days and remaining business hours, ensuring a more accurate adjustment of the input datetime. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
