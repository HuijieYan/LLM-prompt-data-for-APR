The buggy function `apply` is attempting to adjust a given date based on a business hour offset, but it does not handle the CustomBusinessHour offset correctly, causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to raise a ValueError.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the CustomBusinessHour offset within the `apply` function. When the `pd.date_range` method invokes `apply` with the CustomBusinessHour offset, the function fails to handle the offset properly, resulting in the ValueError raised during the test.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the `apply` function to correctly handle the CustomBusinessHour offset. The function should be able to determine whether the offset is a CustomBusinessHour or any other type of business hour offset, and adjust the given date accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should pass the failing test:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other methods)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                return self.rollforward(other)
            
            # Original implementation for other types of business hour offsets
            # ... (rest of the original implementation)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function is modified to first check if the offset is a CustomBusinessHour. If it is, the `rollforward` method of CustomBusinessHour is invoked to handle the adjustment correctly. If the offset is of any other type, the function proceeds with the original implementation.

With this correction, the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without raising a ValueError.
