The bug in the function apply is likely to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours. The function is unable to accurately adjust the datetime object as per the CustomBusinessHour, resulting in incorrect outputs.

The following issues have been identified from the failing test cases:
1. The addition of business days is not being handled correctly. The function is not properly handling the skip_bd adjustment when the current datetime object does not lie on the business hours.
2. The adjustment of remaining business hours is resulting in incorrect outputs.

A suggested strategy to fix the bug would be to revise the logic for adding business days and adjusting the remaining business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the function apply:

```python
# ... (imports and other class/function declarations remain unchanged)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # retrieving the time part of the datetime object
            time_part = other.time()
    
            n = self.n
    
            # check if the given time is within the business hours
            if time_part >= self.start and time_part <= self.end:
                return other
    
            # finding the next opening time
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            # finding the business hours for one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            # finding the absolute value of the number of business days
            bd = abs(n) // (businesshours / 60)
            remainder = abs(n) % (businesshours / 60)
    
            # moving the datetime object by the number of business days
            if n >= 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other += timedelta(days=bd)
            else:
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= timedelta(days=bd)
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(days=(bd - 1))
    
            # adjusting the remaining business hours
            if remainder > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    current_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    while remainder > 0:
                        time_left_in_interval = (self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other).total_seconds()
                        if remainder >= time_left_in_interval:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                            remainder -= time_left_in_interval
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(seconds=remainder)
                            break
                else:
                    current_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while remainder > 0:
                        time_left_in_interval = (self._next_opening_time(other) - other).total_seconds()
                        if remainder >= time_left_in_interval:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                            remainder -= time_left_in_interval
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(seconds=remainder)
                            break
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function includes a revised logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. This should now yield the correct outputs for the failing test cases.
