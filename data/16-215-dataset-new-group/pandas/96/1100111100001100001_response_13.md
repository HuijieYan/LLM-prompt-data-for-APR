By analyzing the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output variable values, it is clear that the function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. However, there are several potential causes of the bugs observed in the function:

1. The function may encounter issues with the manipulation of the 'other' parameter, including handling edge conditions and resetting the timezone and nanosecond fields.
2. The calculation of business hours and adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining hours may be causing unexpected behavior.
3. The loop logic for adjusting the remaining business hours within the while loops may not be correctly handling all cases.

Given these potential causes, it appears that the core issue lies in the logic for adjusting the 'other' datetime based on the provided business hours and the 'n' parameter.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for the 'other' datetime should be refactored to ensure that it correctly accounts for both positive and negative values of 'n', handles edge conditions, and properly calculates and adjusts the remaining business hours.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjustment of timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                prev_open_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_open_time) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(prev_open_time)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_open_time - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_open_time - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to ensure that business hours and the datetime are correctly handled, accounting for positive and negative 'n' values, and properly adjusting the remaining business hours. This should address the observed bugs and improve the function's behavior.
