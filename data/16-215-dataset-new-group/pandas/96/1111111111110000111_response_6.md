The issue in the buggy function is causing incorrect results when adding a holiday to the frequency argument in the date_range function. Specifically, when creating a date range using periods and a customs business hour frequency with holidays, the result contains more periods than expected, leading to an assertion error. This issue corresponds to GitHub Issue #30593 titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding a holiday."

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the calculation of business hours correctly when adjusting the `other` datetime based on the specified frequency including holidays.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the adjustment of the `other` datetime instance in the `apply` function appropriately accounts for holidays in the specified frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # start and end times of the business hours
        business_hours_start = self.start
        business_hours_end = self.end
        # Calculate the business hours between the start and end times
        business_hours = sum((en - st).seconds // 60 for st, en in zip(business_hours_start, business_hours_end))

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in business_hours_end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in business_hours_start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Check for holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly
        holiday_offsets = [o.n for o in self.holidays]
        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    # if the next opening time is a holiday, skip it
                    while self._next_opening_time(other).date() in holiday_offsets:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while r > 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    # if the closing time for the next business day is a holiday, skip it
                    next_closing_day = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    if next_closing_day.date() in holiday_offsets:
                        other = next_closing_day

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After making these changes and ensuring that the related functions in the `BusinessHourMixin` class handle holidays correctly, the `apply` function will be able to adjust the `other` datetime based on the specified frequency, including holidays, and the test will pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
