## Identify Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The conversion of `other` to a datetime object
2. The adjustment for positive and negative values of `n`
3. The adjustment of `other` for holidays and business days
4. The calculation of business hours and adjustment of remaining business hours

## Explain the Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object when adding holidays and business days. This could lead to unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and passing holidays, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Suggest a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the adjustments for positive and negative values of `n`, holidays, and business days need to be carefully reviewed and corrected. The business hours calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours also need to be reviewed and potentially revised.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Use replace to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to the calculation of holidays, BusinessDay, and business hours to fix the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
