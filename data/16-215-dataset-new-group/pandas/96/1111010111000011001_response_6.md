The buggy function `apply` is in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, and it's meant to adjust the input datetime according to the specified business hours. However, it currently contains several bugs that prevent it from returning the correct adjusted datetime.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrect adjustment logic for positive and negative business hours.
2. Incorrect handling of business days skipping.
3. Incorrect calculation of business hours and adjustment logic.
4. Possible issues with the `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function `apply` has not been written to correctly handle adjustments of datetime according to the specified business hours and business days. This has led to the failing of the provided test case.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the adjustment logic for both positive and negative business hours is correctly implemented.
2. Ensure that the logic for skipping business days and handling business days correctly is implemented.
3. Verify the business hours calculation logic and make the necessary corrections.
4. Check for issues in the `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods and fix as needed.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ensure that the timezone and nanosecond are reset
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        # Business days adjustment
        if self.n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
        elif self.n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        # Business hours adjustment
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        total_seconds = abs(self.n) * 60 * businesshours

        if self.n < 0:
            total_seconds = -total_seconds

        days, seconds = divmod(abs(total_seconds), 86400)
        if days:
            other += timedelta(days=days)

        remaining_seconds = timedelta(seconds=seconds)

                    diff_to_start = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0]) - other
                    if diff_to_start.total_seconds() <= remaining_seconds.total_seconds():
                        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0]) + remaining_seconds
                        remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other += remaining_seconds
                        remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)

                    remaining_seconds -= next_day_closing - other
                else:
                    other += remaining_seconds
                    remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)
            else:
                prev_day_closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                prev_day_opening = self._prev_opening_time(prev_day_closing)

                if curr_time > self.end[0]:

                    if diff_to_end.total_seconds() <= remaining_seconds.total_seconds():
                        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0]) - remaining_seconds
                        remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other -= remaining_seconds
                        remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)
                elif (other - prev_day_opening).total_seconds() <= remaining_seconds.total_seconds():
                    other = prev_day_opening
                    remaining_seconds -= other - prev_day_opening
                else:

                    remaining_seconds = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function includes a modified business day and business hour adjustment logic based on the specified business hours. Ensure that the `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and other related methods are also correct to support the changes made in this function. Once updated, this corrected function is expected to pass the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
