The buggy function `apply` seems to be related to the issue in the GitHub post. The issue is related to the `pd.date_range` method creating more than the specified number of periods when using custom business hours with holidays. This issue arises specifically when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a set of holidays.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue is likely due to the logic used to adjust the datetime when a holiday is encountered. The logic may not be correctly handling the adjustment of the datetime when a holiday is encountered, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated.

It's also important to note that the `apply_wraps` decorator is used with the `apply` function, but the implementation of the `apply_wraps` function is not provided. This raises a red flag as the decorator may be interfering with the behavior of the `apply` function.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime when encountering a holiday needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly re-implemented. Additionally, if the `apply_wraps` decorator is affecting the behavior, it should be thoroughly examined.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust the timezone and nanosecond
        other = as_datetime(other)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on the offset
        if n >= 0 and (other.to_pydatetime().time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and other.to_pydatetime().time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while (bhour_remain != timedelta(0)):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while (bhour_remain != timedelta(0)):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments to the datetime based on the offset, business days, and remaining business hours are implemented with corrected logic. Additionally, the `is_on_offset` function is replaced with `self.is_on_offset`, and adjustments related to nanoseconds have been identified and handled appropriately.

This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub post and handle the adjustment of datetimes when using custom business hours with holidays.
