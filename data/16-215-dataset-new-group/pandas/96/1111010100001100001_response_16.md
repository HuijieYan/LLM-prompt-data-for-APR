### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business hours within the `apply` function. This is causing incorrect adjustments to the input `other` which is leading to unexpected results in the return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours. 
2. Ensure that the calculations for business hours, remaining hours, and adjustments are handled correctly based on the input `other` and `self` properties.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):

            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
