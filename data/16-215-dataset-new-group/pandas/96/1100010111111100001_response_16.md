The bug is caused by incorrect date calculations and inefficient adjustment of business hours. This results in incorrect outputs and fails the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message shows a ValueError being raised when frequency is validated against the date index. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly adjust the datetime, handle business day adjustment, and calculate remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    break
                # go to previous business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
