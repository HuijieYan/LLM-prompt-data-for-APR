Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables at the function's return, it seems that the bug in the function is related to the calculation of the business days and business hours. The adjustment of time to business hours and days seems to be the cause of the bug.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours. It seems that there is inconsistency in the calculations which is leading to incorrect results. The adjustment of business days and hours needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Remove the existing code for resetting timezone and nanosecond
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            # Adjust for business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Adjust for non-business day
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)

            other = other + skip_bd

        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(minutes=r))
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(minutes=r))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment logic and addresses the potential errors identified in the buggy function. It recalculates business days and hours based on the provided input and should now return the correct results.
