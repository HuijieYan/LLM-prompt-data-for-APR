### Fixing the bug
The issue appears to be related to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours when there are holidays. The buggy function should be modified to correctly handle the holidays and calculate business hours to align with the expected behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly calculating business hours and holidays when a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays is provided. To fix this issue, the buggy function needs to be updated to properly handle holidays and adjust business hours without adding extra periods.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n > 0:
            start_dt = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
            end_dt = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0])
        else:
            end_dt = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
            start_dt = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0])

        if n > 0 and other.time() < self.end[0] or n < 0 and other.time() >= self.end[0]:
            next_start = start_dt
            next_end = end_dt
        else:
            next_start = end_dt
            next_end = end_dt

        # Skip holidays if they are on the end of period
        if next_end.time() == self.end[0] and next_end.date() in self.holidays:
            next_end += self

        while n < 0 and next_end.time() == self.start[0]:
            next_end -= self

            if next_end.time() != self.start[0] and next_end.date() in self.holidays:
                next_end -= self

        while n > 0 and next_end.time() != self.end[0]:
            next_end += self

            if next_end.time() == self.end[0] and next_end.date() in self.holidays:
                next_end += self

        return next_end
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After making these changes and running the failing test, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the holidays and produce the expected results for the provided frequency.
