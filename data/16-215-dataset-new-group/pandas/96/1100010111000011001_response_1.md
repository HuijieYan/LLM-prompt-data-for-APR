The bug in the provided function `apply` is related to the calculation of business days and business hours. The custom business hours are not correctly calculated, leading to wrong output values for the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the calculation of business hours and business days to accurately reflect the specified custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate business hours
        businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version properly handles the adjustment of business hours and business days based on the provided custom business hours. It should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output values for the specified test cases.
