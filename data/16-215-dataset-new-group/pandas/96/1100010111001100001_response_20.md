The buggy function is failing because it is not handling business hours properly in the presence of holidays, resulting in incorrect output values. The issues stem from the calculations and adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable within the function. 

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours needs to be reviewed and revised to account for holidays and business hour intervals.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            # modify other to be in the same timezone as self
            other = self._to_offset(other)
            
            # adjust to the next business hour if the current time is not on offset or if it's not the end of the business hour
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                bd = n
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(self.next_bday.rollforward(other)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self.next_bday.rollforward(other))
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=0)
                
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=self._to_seconds(n=n))
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain >= bhour
                    and (bhour_remain != bhour or nanosecond != 0)
                ):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            
            return other

# Apply the corrected function to the failing test case
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    freq = CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

By making the above adjustments to the apply function and reapplying it to the failing test case, the bug should be fixed and the test should pass.
