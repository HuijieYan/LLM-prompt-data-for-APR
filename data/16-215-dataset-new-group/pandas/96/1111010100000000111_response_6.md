The bug in the `apply` function is causing unexpected behavior when using periods in the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours that include holidays. It results in incorrect ranges being generated, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug appears to be related to how the `apply` function adjusts the dates based on business hours and holidays. It seems that the adjustment logic is leading to incorrect date-time combinations, especially when holidays are involved.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly adjust the dates while considering holidays and handle the edge cases properly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            holiday_dates = self.holidays
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            if holiday_dates and isinstance(other, date):
                while other in holiday_dates:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)

            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) and business_hours > 0:
                remainder = timedelta()

                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    remainder = self._get_closing_time(other) - other

                while remainder.total_seconds() > 0:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + remainder)
                    shift = min(remainder, next_opening_time - other)
                    other += shift
                    remainder -= shift
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        remainder += self._get_closing_time(other) - other

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function considers holiday dates and handles the adjustment of dates and time intervals more accurately. It should work correctly with `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours and holidays.

Applying this fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
