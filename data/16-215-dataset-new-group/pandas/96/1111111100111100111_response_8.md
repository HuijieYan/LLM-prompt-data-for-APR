The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class causes incorrect behavior when combining business hours with datetime objects that include holidays. This issue was posted on GitHub as "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" and is related to the `pd.date_range` function. The bug results in the `pd.date_range` producing more than the specified number of periods when a holiday is added to the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

The cause of the bug is within the logic of the `apply` function. It incorrectly handles the adjustment of timestamps when the number of business hours is negative and involves the application of business day adjustments. This leads to inaccurate business hour calculations, resulting in the incorrect number of periods produced by `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to revise the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustments for positive and negative business hours, including the adjustments for holidays and business days.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other
        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_time = self._move_to_next_valid_time(other, n)
        else:
            adjusted_time = self._move_to_previous_valid_time(other)
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _move_to_next_valid_time(self, current_time, n):
    if self._is_on_offset(current_time):
        current_time += BusinessHour(n * 60)
    else:
        if current_time.time() < self.start[0]:
            current_time = current_time.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute,
                                                second=self.start[0].second, microsecond=self.start[0].microsecond) - timedelta(seconds=1)
        current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
    return current_time

def _move_to_previous_valid_time(self, current_time):
    if current_time.time() in self.start:
        current_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
    if self._is_on_offset(current_time):
        return self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(current_time))
    return current_time
```

In this corrected version of the `apply` function, two new methods `move_to_next_valid_time` and `move_to_previous_valid_time` have been introduced to handle the adjustments for positive and negative business hours, respectively, taking into account the presence of holidays and business days.

These changes should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure accurate business hour calculations with `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.
