The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect adjustments to the `other` variable, resulting in the failing test. It fails due to incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object. The adjustments are supposed to be based on business hours, but they are not calculated accurately.

The strategy to fix the bug is to carefully review the logic inside the `apply` function and ensure that the adjustments to the `other` variable are computed correctly based on the business hours as indicated. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the number of business days and the remaining business hours needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), datetime.min.time())
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        total_seconds = abs(n * 60 * 60)

        total_bdays, remaining_seconds = divmod(total_seconds, businesshours)

        adjusted_datetime = other + timedelta(days=total_bdays)

        if remaining_seconds != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)

                while remaining_seconds > 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_time_remaining = closing_time - adjusted_datetime

                    if remaining_seconds >= business_time_remaining.seconds:
                        adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                        remaining_seconds -= business_time_remaining.seconds
                    else:
                        adjusted_datetime += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                        remaining_seconds = 0

            else:
                adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

                while remaining_seconds > 0:
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_time_remaining = opening_time - adjusted_datetime

                    if remaining_seconds >= business_time_remaining.seconds:
                        adjusted_datetime = opening_time
                        remaining_seconds -= business_time_remaining.seconds
                    else:
                        adjusted_datetime -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                        remaining_seconds = 0

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculation to adjust the `other` datetime based on business hours, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
