The bug is in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The bug is causing the `pd.date_range` function, specifically when adding holidays, to produce more periods than expected. It appears that the adjustments for holidays and business hours calculations are causing the incorrect output.

The bug is due to incorrect business hour calculations when adjusting for holidays. The calculations for adjusting the business day and business hours are not functioning as planned, which results in an incorrect number of periods in the `pd.date_range` function. This issue has been raised on GitHub, highlighting the unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix the bug, the calculations and adjustments for holidays and business hours need to be corrected. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the adjustments result in the expected number of periods in the `pd.date_range` output.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(
                hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # Original business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
            if n >= 0:
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            else:
                bd, r = divmod(abs((n + 1) * 60), business_hours // 60)
                r = business_hours // 60 - 1 - r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._prev_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the incorrect business hour calculations when adjusting for holidays. By making adjustments to the business day and business hours, the function produces the expected number of periods in the `pd.date_range` output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
