The buggy function seems to be causing issues when using the `pd.date_range` function with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and adding holidays. The error message from the failing test also indicates that a ValueError is being raised due to the frequency not conforming to the passed values.

Upon analysis, the potential cause of the bug can be related to the way the `apply` method handles the addition of holidays and the calculation of business days and remaining business hours. It seems that the presence of holidays might be distorting the calculation, leading to more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic in the `apply` function to account for holidays and adjust the business day calculation and remaining hours accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis and expected variable values:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Existing code related to datetime conversion and adjustments
        
        # Add logic to consider holidays when adjusting business days and business hours
        if self.holidays and isinstance(self.holidays, list):
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                holiday_date = datetime.strptime(holiday, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
                if other.date() == holiday_date:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Remaining code for business day and business hour adjustments

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating logic to consider holidays and adjusting the calculation of business days and remaining business hours, the corrected `apply` function should resolve the issue. This should ensure that the `pd.date_range` function works as expected even when using periods and adding holidays.
