The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function attempts to calculate the next business hour based on a given input and business hours configuration. The function is failing for the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `test_date_range.py`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function involve the following:
1. The logic for adjusting the input `other` based on the value of `n`
2. The calculation of `businesshours`
3. The use of `skip_bd` and the subsequent handling 
4. The adjustment to `other` based on remaining business hours `bhour_remain` for both positive and negative `n`

The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistent variable states and inconsistent logic for adjusting `other` and handling remaining business hours.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
1. Reviewing and refactoring the logic for adjusting `other` based on `n`
2. Making sure that the calculation of `businesshours` is correct and reflects the true number of business hours
3. Reviewing the use of `skip_bd` and how it's applied to `other`
4. Reviewing and refactoring the handling of remaining business hours `bhour_remain` for both positive and negative `n`

Here's the updated function to fix the bug:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() == self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 60

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other += bd * CustomBusinessDay()

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
