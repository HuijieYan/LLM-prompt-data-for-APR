The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is likely causing the issue reported in the GitHub post. The bug causes the `apply` function to produce more periods than expected when combined with holidays.

The `apply` function adjusts datetime objects based on the specified business hours but does not handle holidays correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when combined with the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `apply` function to account for holidays and adjust the logic to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Existing code ...
        if isinstance(self.cal, CustomBusinessHour) and self.cal.holidays:
            # Check if the datetime falls on a holiday
            if other in self.cal.holidays:
                other = self.cal._next_opening_time(other)

        # Existing code ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for holidays when the `CustomBusinessHour` calendar is specified. If the datetime falls on a holiday, it is adjusted to the next opening time based on the specified business hours.

This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post by handling holidays correctly in the `apply` function.
