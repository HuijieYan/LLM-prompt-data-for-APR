The buggy function `apply` has multiple bugs with incorrect variable manipulations leading to incorrect output. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly assigning the expected values to the `other` variable, `nanosecond` variable, calculates the `businesshours`, the values of `bd`, `r`, `skip_bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` are incorrect based on the time calculations performed within the function.

A possible strategy to fix the bug is to use a manual debug print at various points in the function to check for each variable's value to understand and correct the calculation/logic that is causing the issue. Additionally, some of the operations within the function need to be rewritten to ensure proper handling of the `other` datetime variable and the time interval calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(  # reset timezone and nanosecond
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if (
                    other.time() in self.end
                    or not self._is_on_offset(other)
                ):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if (
                    other.time() in self.start
                ):  # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), ((businesshours // 60) * 60))
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):  # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:  # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:  # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):  # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:  # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the problematic sections of code have been adjusted to match the expected logic. This ensures that the `other` datetime variable and other associated variables maintain the appropriate values.
