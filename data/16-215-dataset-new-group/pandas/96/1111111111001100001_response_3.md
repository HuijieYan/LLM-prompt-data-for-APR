The cause of the bugs in the provided function appears to be related to the adjustments made within the function, as well as the handling of business days and business hours. The adjustment of the "other" parameter to reduce the number of cases to handle might be causing the issue, along with the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, one possible strategy is to carefully review and potentially refactor the logic inside the function to ensure it correctly handles adjustments and edge cases related to business days, hours, and timing intervals.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        adjusted_other = other.replace(nanosecond=0, tzinfo=None)

        if n >= 0:
            if adjusted_other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
        else:
            if adjusted_other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                remain = adjusted_other - prev_open
                adjusted_other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                adjusted_other += skip_bd

        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_business_hours > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)) - adjusted_other
                if remaining_business_hours < bhour:
                    adjusted_other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour)
        else:
            while remaining_business_hours > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other) - adjusted_other
                if remaining_business_hours >= bhour or (remaining_business_hours == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    adjusted_other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return adjusted_other
```

This corrected version of the function is designed to address the potential bugs identified in the original function and should pass the failing tests.
