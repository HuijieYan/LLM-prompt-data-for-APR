The bug in the provided buggy function is causing the test to fail. The `CustomBusinessHour` is not handling the holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect output in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is linked to how the custom business hour handles the holidays. The `apply` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class fails to apply the correct business hours when there are holidays involved. This leads to an incorrect computation of business hours and non-business hours, ultimately resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method should be modified to properly consider the holidays, and adjust the business hours accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Add a condition to skip the holidays when necessary
        if other in self.holidays:
            if n >= 0:
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)

        # Calculate and return the number of business days to advance the date 'other'
        return self._apply_business_day_offset(other, n)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updates the `apply` method to consider the holidays and adjust the business hours accordingly. By using the `_apply_business_day_offset` method, it computes the number of business days to advance the date 'other'. This should resolve the reported issue and pass the failing test.

After updating the `apply` method with the corrected version, the failing test should pass, and the reported GitHub issue should be resolved.
