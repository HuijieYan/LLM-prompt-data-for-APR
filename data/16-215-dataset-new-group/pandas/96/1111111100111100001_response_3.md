The buggy function `apply` is supposed to modify a datetime object based on a specified offset, but it seems to be failing due to the complexity of the logic and potential cases not being handled properly. When looking at the various cases and their corresponding return values, it is evident that the logic inside the `apply` function is not correctly handling the offset calculation and adjustment.

The `apply` function is responsible for adjusting the input `other` datetime object based on the provided `self` offset. It involves various calculations to handle the offset, business hours, business days, and remaining hours. The primary issues arise from the handling of the `n` offset and the adjustment of the `other` datetime object, which leads to inconsistent and incorrect results.

It appears that the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours is not working as expected, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug:
- Carefully review and simplify the logic inside the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly handles positive and negative offsets, business day adjustments, and remaining business hours.
- Split the functionality into smaller, more manageable parts to make the code more readable and easier to debug.
- Properly test the modified logic with various offset values to ensure it produces the expected results.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function based on the analysis:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # handle adjustment for business days
        if self.n != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=self.n)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # handle adjustment for remaining business hours
        if self.n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                adj_time = min(timedelta(minutes=r), next_open - other)
                other += adj_time
                r -= adj_time.total_seconds() / 60
        else:
            while r < 0:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                adj_time = min(timedelta(minutes=abs(r)), other - prev_open)
                other -= adj_time
                r += adj_time.total_seconds() / 60

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the necessity to maintain the current logic has been considered, but it has been restructured to simplify and potentially correct the erroneous parts. This adjusted function also takes into account the input values and the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected function with various scenarios, especially the failing test cases, to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
