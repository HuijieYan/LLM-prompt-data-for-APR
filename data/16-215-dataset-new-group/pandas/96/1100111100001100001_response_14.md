The bug in the given code seems to be related to the adjustment of the time according to business hours and days (e.g., moving to the next business day, getting total business hours, etc.). The implementation uses a mix of `datetime` and `Timestamp` objects, and the logic to adjust business days and hours seems to be incorrect in some cases.

The presence of `nanosecond` references and conversions between `datetime` and `Timestamp` objects suggests that there might be a mix-up in the types or an incorrect approach to handling the time adjustments.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the time adjustment logic and calculations are consistent and compatible with the `Timestamp` object. Additionally, handling of business days and hours needs to be verified and corrected to ensure that it accurately represents the intended behavior.

Based on the analysis and strategy, a corrected version of the function can be provided as follows:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        business_day = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=n)

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust to the next opening time if the current time is not on the offset
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                # Adjust to the next opening and then get the closing time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours and days is simplified and adapted to work directly with `pd.Timestamp` objects, using built-in pandas functionalities for time adjustments and offsets. Additionally, the inconsistent reference to `nanosecond` and other low-level datetime operations is removed in favor of a more straightforward and consistent approach.
