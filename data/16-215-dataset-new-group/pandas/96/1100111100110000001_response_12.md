The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message points to a failed test that involves validating a frequency against a DatetimeArray in the `_validate_frequency` method.

Upon analyzing the function, the potential error locations are identified as follows:
1. Incorrect usage of `other.time()` in the function.
2. Incorrect comparison with `self._is_on_offset(other)` resulting in unexpected behavior.
3. Incorrect usage of the `skip_bd` variable to handle business days.
4. Incorrect calculation of `bhour` and `bhour_remain`.

The cause of the bug is incorrect handling of business hours, time intervals, and business days which lead to unexpected results. The error message indicates the specific error, which is related to frequency validation for a custom business hour frequency.

To fix the bug:
1. Correctly compare the time component of `other` with `self.start` and `self.end` rather than the complete datetime object.
2. Ensure that the comparison with `self._is_on_offset(other)` is handled correctly to identify if `other` is on the offset or not.
3. Properly adjust the `skip_bd` variable to handle business days.
4. Review the logic for calculating `bhour` and `bhour_remain` to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

The corrected version of the function is shown below:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # reset other to the nearest business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculation of business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # skipping business days
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # remaining adjustments
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours adjustment
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self._prev_opening_time(other),
                        self._next_opening_time(other))
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self._prev_opening_time(other),
                        self._next_opening_time(other))
                    )
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function should resolve the issues with handling business hours, business days, and time intervals and pass the failing test.
