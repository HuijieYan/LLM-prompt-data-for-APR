The bug is likely caused by the incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable within the `apply` function. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on a time offset, but in some cases, it fails to do so correctly.

The strategy to fix the bug involves reviewing the logic used to adjust the `other` datetime object and to ensure that it correctly handles both positive and negative time offsets.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if abs(bhour_remain) < bhour or (abs(bhour_remain) == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to ensure the correct handling of both positive and negative time offsets. This version should now pass the failing test by providing the expected results.
