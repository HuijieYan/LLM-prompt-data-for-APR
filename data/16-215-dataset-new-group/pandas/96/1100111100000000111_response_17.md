Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be with the CustomBusinessHour's apply method, which leads to incorrect results when holidays are introduced. 

The issue with the CustomBusinessHour's apply method may be causing the output of pd.date_range to include more periods than specified when holidays are provided. This happens when using the periods argument, but it works fine when using the end argument instead.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the apply method of CustomBusinessHour to handle holidays correctly and adjust the generation of periods based on the presence of holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the apply method:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# Define the corrected CustomBusinessHour class with a fixed apply method
class CustomBusinessHourFixed(CustomBusinessHour):
    @staticmethod
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            holiday_set = set(self.holidays)
            holiday_list = list(self.holidays)
            
            # If other is a holiday, adjust it to the next opening time
            while other in holiday_set or other.date() in holiday_set:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            # Generate periods based on the adjusted other
            periods_list = [other]
            for _ in range(1, self.n_periods):
                next_period = self._next_opening_time(periods_list[-1])
                # Skip over holidays
                while next_period in holiday_set or next_period.date() in holiday_set:
                    next_period = self._next_opening_time(next_period)
                periods_list.append(next_period)
            
            return periods_list
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Create an instance of CustomBusinessHourFixed and use it in the pd.date_range call
freq = CustomBusinessHourFixed(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'], n_periods=14)
pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=freq.n_periods, freq=freq)
```

With the corrected apply method, the CustomBusinessHour class handles holidays correctly, and generating periods using the pd.date_range call should now produce the expected number of periods, regardless of the presence of holidays.

Please note that the corrected version assumes the existence of a `n_periods` attribute, defining the number of periods to generate, in the CustomBusinessHour class. If such an attribute does not exist, it needs to be added to the class definition.
