Looking at the bug and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue is related to the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message indicates that there is a problem with passing the frequency with custom business hours. The frequency does not conform to the correct output.

The bug seems to be related to how the business hours are calculated and adjusted when applying the frequency. It fails to correctly handle the logic for business days, adjusting hours, and navigating through business time intervals.

The strategy to fix the bug involves refactoring the logic inside the `apply` function to accurately handle business days, business hour adjustments, and navigating through time intervals.

Now, I will provide the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            n = self.n
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # handle business days adjustments
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other += skip_bd
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            # adjust the remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            adjustments = 0
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0 and adjustments < 100:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    adjust = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    other += adjust
                    bhour_remain -= adjust
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    adjustments += 1
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0 and adjustments < 100:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    adjust = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    other -= adjust
                    bhour_remain -= adjust
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    adjustments += 1

            if bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                raise ValueError("Exceeded maximum number of adjustments")

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles business days, adjustments, and navigation through time intervals more accurately to conform to the expected frequency for custom business hours.

This fix should address the failing test cases and resolve the original issue reported on GitHub.
