The bug in the function `apply` is causing incorrect outputs when using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays. The function is not properly adjusting the datetime based on business hours, leading to unexpected results. The issue is reported on GitHub with a detailed description of the problem.

The cause of the bug is that the business hour adjustment logic within the `apply` function is not handling the holiday correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods being added to `pd.date_range`.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve revising the logic for adjusting business hours, specifically taking into account the impact of holidays on the business hours calculation. Additionally, the adjustments for previous and next business days need to be reviewed to ensure correct behavior around holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the function `apply` that addresses the mentioned issue:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        if self.on_holiday(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_between(self.start, self.end)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            other = self._adjust_business_days(other, bd)

        if r != 0:
            other = self._adjust_remaining_hours(other, r, n)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the revised function, we have introduced logic to handle holidays and adjusted the remaining hours calculation to account for the impact of holidays and incorrect results. Additionally, the adjustments for previous and next business days have been updated to handle edge cases around holidays.

This corrected function should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for adjusting business hours with holidays when using the `pd.date_range` function.
