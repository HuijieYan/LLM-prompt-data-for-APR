The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the `pd.date_range` method to behave unexpectedly by producing more than the specified number of periods when using custom business hours with holidays. 

After analyzing the provided cases and the failing test, it seems that the issue is related to the adjustment of the timestamps when using periods, holidays, and custom business hours. The logic inside the `apply` function is causing the resulting timestamps to shift or not align with the expected behavior, leading to unexpected periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

To fix this bug and address the issue reported on GitHub, the adjustment part of the `apply` function needs to be corrected to ensure that the timestamps are aligned correctly based on the specified custom business hours and holidays. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_day = BusinessDay(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
        result = business_day.apply(other)
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version leverages the `apply` function of the `BusinessDay` class, ensuring that the custom business hours and holidays are applied accurately to the given timestamps. This should address the unexpected periods issue and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
