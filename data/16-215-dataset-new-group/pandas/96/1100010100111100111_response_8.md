The bug in the `apply` function is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results that do not align with the specified periods and holidays. This issue is clearly identified in the failing GitHub issue, where the user provides examples of the unexpected behavior. The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of holidays and the subsequent generation of datetime ranges.

Upon analyzing the input parameters and other variable values, it appears that the adjustment logic within the `apply` function is not properly considering holidays when generating business hours. This leads to incorrect datetime ranges when used in the `pd.date_range` function.

The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays, especially in the `skip_bd` and `bhour_remain` computations.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Adjust by business days first
        if n != 0:
            bday_offset = CustomBusinessDay(n=n, holidays=self.holidays)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = bday_offset.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = other + bday_offset

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        if n >= 0:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += self._inverse_nano_adjust(other)
        else:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= self._nano_adjust(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustments for holidays are properly handled using the `rollforward` and `_inverse_nano_adjust` functions to ensure accurate business hours without skipping over holidays.

This should resolve the issue reported in the failing GitHub issue related to the unexpected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when incorporating periods and holidays.
