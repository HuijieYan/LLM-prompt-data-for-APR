Based on the existing code and the runtime input/output values provided, it seems that the buggy function `apply` is unable to handle the custom business hour correctly, leading to incorrect outputs. The function is not effectively adjusting the business hours based on the specified custom business schedule, which is causing the failing test case.

The bug appears to be related to how the function is adjusting the input datetime object based on the custom business hour settings, especially with respect to handling of positive and negative offsets.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for custom business hours needs to be reviewed and potentially rewritten based on the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# import required libraries if not already imported

# make necessary changes to the adjust method to handle custom business hours
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for positive and negative offsets based on the custom business hour settings
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() not in self.end else other
        else:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1) if other.time() in self.start else other
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the outlined adjustments to the function, it should be able to handle the custom business hour settings correctly and produce the expected outputs, resolving the issue with the failing test case.
