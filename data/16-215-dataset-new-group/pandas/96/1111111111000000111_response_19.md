The buggy function applies a custom business hour frequency to a datetime. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using periods and adding holidays, the result is incorrect, producing more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug is that when adjusting the datetime to reduce the number of cases to handle, the buggy function does not properly handle holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

To fix the bug, the buggy function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the code remains the same

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        # rest of the code remains the same
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the buggy function should now handle holidays properly and produce the correct number of periods when used in conjunction with the `pd.date_range` function, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
