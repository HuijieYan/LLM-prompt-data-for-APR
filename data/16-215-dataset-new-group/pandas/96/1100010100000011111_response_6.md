The bug in the `apply` function is causing unexpected behavior when adding holidays in the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` frequency when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`. The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime values based on the holiday and producing unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the strategy will be to: 
1. Identify the specific area in the function where the faulty adjustments are being made.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for holidays are handled correctly and do not produce unexpected results in the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # The rest of the function remains the same

        # ... [Previous code]

        # adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        adjusted_other = self._apply_holidays(other)

        # The rest of the function remains unchanged

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _apply_holidays(self, dt):
    # Check if the given date is a holiday and adjust if necessary
    while dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') in self.holidays:
        dt += np.timedelta64(1, 'D')
    return dt
```

In this correction, we have added a separate method `_apply_holidays` to handle the adjustment of dates based on holidays. This method checks if the date is a holiday and adjusts it accordingly.

By implementing this fix, the `apply` function should now correctly handle the holiday adjustments and produce the expected results for the `pd.date_range` function.
