The buggy function is performing calculations related to business hours by trying to adjust a given date and time based on some input parameters. However, there seem to be several logic errors within the function that need to be fixed. Specifically, there are inconsistencies in dealing with the time offsets and negative indices for opening time adjustments.

The calculation issues in the buggy function are leading to incorrect results while applying business hours to a given timestamp. As a result, the returned values do not match the expected values for a wide variety of test cases.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to carefully review the logic used to adjust the timestamp based on the business hours. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the processing of negative business hour adjustments that need to be addressed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            non_business_seconds = 0  # to handle non-business hours separately
            
            # For positive business hour adjustments
            if n >= 0:
                n_days, n_seconds = divmod(n * 3600, 86400)  # calculate number of days
                dt_with_offset = other + timedelta(days=n_days)  # adjust the date
                hour = self._next_opening_time(dt_with_offset)  # next opening time
                
                if hour.time() == self.start.time():
                    # If the time is in the business hours, keep it as is
                    # Else, move to next opening time
                    if not self._is_on_offset(hour):
                        hour = self._next_opening_time(hour)
                else:
                    # If the time is not the at the start of business hour
                    # adjust with the opening time
                    hour = self._next_opening_time(dt_with_offset)
                
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(hour) - hour
                non_business_seconds = (other - dt_with_offset).total_seconds() % 3600
                adjusted_time = hour + timedelta(seconds=non_business_seconds)
                return adjusted_time + timedelta(seconds=n_seconds)
            
            # For negative business hour adjustments
            else:
                n = -n  # consider absolute value for simplicity
                n_days, n_seconds = divmod(n * 3600, 86400)  # calculate number of days
                dt_with_offset = other - timedelta(days=n_days)  # adjust the date
                hour = self._prev_opening_time(dt_with_offset)  # previous opening time
                
                if hour.time() == self.start.time():
                    # If the time is in the business hours, keep it as is
                    # Else, move to prev opening time
                    if not self._is_on_offset(hour):
                        hour = self._prev_opening_time(hour)
                else:
                    # If the time is not the at the start of business hour
                    # adjust with the previous opening time
                    hour = self._prev_opening_time(dt_with_offset) 
                    
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(hour) - hour
                non_business_seconds = (dt_with_offset - other).total_seconds() % 3600
                
                adjusted_time = hour - timedelta(seconds=non_business_seconds)
                
                return adjusted_time - timedelta(seconds=n_seconds)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues with adjusting the business hours and negative hour offsets, as well as properly handling non-business hours. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the various test cases provided.
