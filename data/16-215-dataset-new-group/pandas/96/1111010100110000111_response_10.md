Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug arises when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file in the pandas library.

The bug seems to cause the issue in the `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays. The error message states that the inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully analyze the logic in the `apply` function and ensure that it correctly handles the adjustment of business hours when adding holidays. Considering the failing test and the GitHub issue, it is likely that the issue is related to how the `apply` function calculates holidays within the custom business hour frequency.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (existing code)
            # existing logic to adjust business hours
    
            # ensure that holidays are accounted for
            if hasattr(self, "holidays") and self.holidays is not None:
                # check if the date is in holidays and adjust accordingly
                while other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, after the business hours have been adjusted according to the existing logic, the code now includes handling of holidays. It checks if the date is in the holidays and adjusts the time accordingly.

This correction should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue. After applying this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue described in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
