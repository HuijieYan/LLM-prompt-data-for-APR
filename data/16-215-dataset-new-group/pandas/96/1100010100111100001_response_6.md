The issue with the current implementation is that the logic for handling business days and business hours adjustments seems overly complex and is prone to causing incorrect results. The function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on a CustomBusinessHour object, but the adjustments being made are resulting in incorrect output.

The function currently checks for edge conditions, reset the timezone and nanosecond, adjusts based on the number of business days, then tries to calculate the remaining business hours and adjust accordingly. However, due to the overly complex logic, this is resulting in incorrect adjustments and hence incorrect output.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling business days and business hours adjustments needs to be simplified and made more robust to provide the correct results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    adjusted_time = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    next_opening_time = adjusted_time.replace(hour=self.start.hour)
    
    if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time.time()) or adjusted_time.time() == self.start:
        # Time is already a business hour or at the starting hour
        return adjusted_time
    elif adjusted_time.time() > self.end:
        # Round down to the previous business hour
        adjusted_time = adjusted_time.replace(hour=self.end.hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    else:
        # Round up to the next business hour
        adjusted_time = adjusted_time.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(hours=1)
        
    return adjusted_time
```

In this corrected version, we simplified the logic to mainly handle three cases:
1. If the time is already within the business hour, return the same time.
2. If the given time is after the end of the business hour, round down to the end of the business hour.
3. If the given time is before the start of the business hour, round up to the start of the next business hour.

This approach simplifies the logic and should provide correct results.
