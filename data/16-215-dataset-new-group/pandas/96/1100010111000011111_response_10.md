The main issue with the provided code is that the `apply` function is incorrectly manipulating the datetime object `other` and not properly adjusting the business hours. This leads to unexpected results in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment and calculations for business hours are correctly applied to the `other` datetime object. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Adjust to the next business opening time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        total_minutes = abs(n * 60)
        bd = total_minutes // businesshours
        r = total_minutes % (businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain:
                prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening_time) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

I have made changes to ensure the adjustments are correctly made and the business hours are calculated as expected. This corrected version should now pass the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
