The buggy function seems to be trying to apply custom business hours based on a specific start time and holidays. The function appears to be incorrectly calculating the expected business hours by not accounting for the holidays in the calculation.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using custom business hours with a specified start time and holidays. The expected result is not being met, indicating a bug in the `apply` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic of the `apply` function to correctly handle the holidays when calculating the business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle holidays
            start_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start)
            end_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end)
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                if other.time() >= self.start:
                    other = end_time + timedelta(minutes=(other - start_time).seconds // 60)
                else:
                    other = start_time

            # remaining logic for adjusting business hours
            # ... (remaining logic remains the same)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we added handling for holidays based on the given custom business hour constraints. This will ensure that the calculation of business hours takes holidays into account and should fix the failing test.
