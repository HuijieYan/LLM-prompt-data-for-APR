# The buggy function "apply" is used to apply a custom business hour offset to a datetime object, adjusting the datetime to the next or previous business hour as indicated by the offset.

# The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect calculation of total business hours in a day
2. Incorrect adjustment of business days
3. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours
4. Incorrect adjustment of datetime to the next or previous business time interval

# The cause of the bug is that the "apply" function is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours when applying the custom business hour offset to the given datetime object.

# To fix the bug, the logic for calculating total business hours, adjusting business days, and handling remaining business hours needs to be carefully revised to ensure correct adjustment of the datetime object to the next or previous business hour as specified by the offset.

# Here's a corrected version of the "apply" function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # calculate the total number of business minutes
        business_minutes = sum((en - st).total_seconds() // 60 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        n = self.n
        # adjust the time based on the specified offset
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if abs(n) >= business_minutes:
            # Adjust by business days first
            days, remainder = divmod(abs(n), business_minutes)
            if n < 0:
                days, remainder = -days, -remainder

            if days != 0:
                other = other + BusinessHour(n=days)

            # Adjust the remaining business minutes
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remainder)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                closing = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                bhour = closing - next_opening
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other = next_opening + bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = closing
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0:
                        other -= BusinessHour(1)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
With this corrected version of the "apply" function, the failing test should pass.
