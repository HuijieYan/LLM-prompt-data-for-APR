The `apply` function from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file has a bug. From the error message from the failing test, it can be inferred that the bug is related to the custom business hour offset logic. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is attempting to create a date range using custom business hours, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to inferring the frequency.

The bug seems to stem from incorrect logic when adjusting the input datetime based on business hours. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

This suggests that the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours is incorrect, leading to an unexpected inferred frequency, which does not conform to the frequency passed to the function.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for the input datetime based on business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the expected frequency.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return next_opening
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After fixing the logic in the `apply` function, run the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed and that the corrected version passes the test.
