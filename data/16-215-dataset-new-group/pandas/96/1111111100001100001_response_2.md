The buggy function takes a `Timestamp` object and an integer `n` as input and attempts to calculate the next business time (opening/closing) based on the given business hours defined by `self.start` and `self.end`. It seems that the function's intention is to handle cases where `n` can be positive or negative, meaning it must calculate business times in the future or in the past.

The function uses various helper functions from the same file and class, such as `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time`. These functions are intended to provide the buggy function with the necessary calculations to determine the next business time based on the given input timestamp and integer `n`.

There are several issues with the current implementation of the function:
1. The function is applying some business day logic `skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)` but not using it correctly.
2. The use of `while` loops to adjust the remaining business hours seems overly complex and could be simplified.

To fix the bug, it would be better to separate the logic for positive and negative values of `n` and clarify the usage of business day adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other class methods ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if self.n != 0:
                # calculate new datetime based on self.n
                other = self._calculate_new_datetime(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _calculate_new_datetime(self, input_dt):
        n = abs(self.n)
        adjusted_dt = input_dt

        if self.n >= 0:
            for _ in range(n):
                adjusted_dt = self._get_next_opening_by_bhour(adjusted_dt)
        else:
            for _ in range(n):
                adjusted_dt = self._get_prev_opening_by_bhour(adjusted_dt)

        return adjusted_dt

    def _get_next_opening_by_bhour(self, current_dt):
        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(current_dt)
        while not self._is_on_offset(next_opening):
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
        return next_opening

    def _get_prev_opening_by_bhour(self, current_dt):
        prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(current_dt)
        while not self._is_on_offset(prev_opening):
            prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(prev_opening)
        return prev_opening
```

In this version, the `_calculate_new_datetime` function handles the logic of calculating the adjusted datetime based on the value of `n`. It delegates the actual adjustment calculation to two helper functions, `_get_next_opening_by_bhour` and `_get_prev_opening_by_bhour`, which handle the specifics of finding the next or previous opening times based on business hours. Separating the logic in this way makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Note: It seems to be required additional methods from the `CustomBusinessHour` class. These should be implemented based on the actual business day model and calculations available.
