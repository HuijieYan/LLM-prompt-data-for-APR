The buggy function appears to be an implementation of a time offset calculation for business hours. It contains a significant amount of complex logic, and the exact cause of the bug is not immediately apparent.

However, a common issue with datetime operations is manipulating the dates or times incorrectly. An unsafe manipulation would lead to unexpected results, leading to a range of errors. The function should be thoroughly tested with various cases to make sure its condition is met before returning the resulting output.

In order to fix the bug, we should perform a thorough review of the code, including its logic, any operations performed on the input variables, and the expected output values. Next, we will test the function with the provided test cases to verify that it produces the correct output in each scenario.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=(n * 60))

        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            while bd != 0:
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
                
                bd = 0  # reset business days

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            # logic for negative n
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction is based on a reordering of the logical tests and operations in the function and restructuring of the conditional statements to clearly distinguish the positive and negative cases of the "n" value. Testing with the given scenarios and other test cases would be necessary to confirm the correctness of this fix.
