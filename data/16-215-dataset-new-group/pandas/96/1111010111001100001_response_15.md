The buggy function has a few potential error locations. One of the main issues is that it does not handle the given holidays correctly, which results in incorrect output. Another issue could be with the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours, which seems to malfunction in certain cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle holidays and business day adjustments, leading to incorrect output in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function's logic for handling holidays and adjusting business days and remaining business hours needs to be reviewed and updated.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, apply_wraps, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # check if the date is a holiday and adjust it appropriately
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
            
            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    
                if bhour > bhour_remain:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and handle holidays and business day adjustments correctly.
