The buggy function applies business hours to a given datetime object, but it has a number of conditional checks and calculations that could potentially introduce bugs.

- One issue is that the conditional checks may not behave as expected, leading to incorrect results.
- Another potential issue is with the mathematical calculations, including division and adjustment of datetime objects.

To address these issues, we need to ensure that the conditional checks and mathematical operations are appropriately handled, and they result in the correct output.

Here, I've provided a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import the required datetime module
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the corrected version of the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Ignore the body of this function

def _is_business_datetime(dt):
    # Check if the datetime is within business hours
    if dt.weekday() < 5:  # Check if it's a weekday
        if 9 <= dt.hour <= 17:  # Check if it's within business hours (9AM to 5PM)
            return True
    return False

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = 8  # The number of business hours
        businessdays = 0  # Counter for business days
        
        if n == 0:
            return other  # No need to adjust if n is zero
        
        # Define a timedelta for a single business hour
        business_hour = timedelta(hours=1)
        
        while n != 0:
            # If n is positive increment businessdays, and subtract 1 from n
            if n > 0:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
                n -= 1
            # If n is negative
            else:
                # If the current datetime is within business hours, decrement businessdays
                if _is_business_datetime(other):
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    n += 1
                else:
                    break
        
        # Adjusting business hours
        while n != 0:
            # If n is positive
            if n > 0:
                # If the current datetime is within business hours, decrement n
                if _is_business_datetime(other):
                    n -= 1
                # Increment the current datetime
                other += business_hour
            # If n is negative
            else:
                # If the current datetime is within business hours, increment n
                if _is_business_datetime(other):
                    n += 1
                # Decrement the current datetime
                other -= business_hour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the various cases as expected. If there are additional conditions or constraints specific to the application, they can be added accordingly. Remember to consider edge cases and thoroughly test the function to ensure it behaves as expected.
