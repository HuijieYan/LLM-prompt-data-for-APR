### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The error message states "ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH," indicating that the frequency is not being correctly inferred, which leads to unexpected results in date_range with periods and holidays.
2. The issue on GitHub also points out that when using periods and adding holidays, `pd.date_range` does not produce the expected number of periods.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information:
The bug occurs due to incorrect frequency inference, which leads to incorrect date_range output. The `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is not being propagated correctly, leading to the generation of more than the expected periods in `pd.date_range`.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
The code needs to be modified to ensure that the frequency (including periods and holidays) is correctly propagated to date_range. This may require modifying the `apply` function to handle the propagation of the frequency information.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (existing logic)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            n = self.n * 60  # Convert n to minutes

            # Applying the adjustment based on business days and remaining hours
            other = self._apply_business_days(other, n // businesshours)
            other = self._apply_remaining_hours(other, n % businesshours)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _apply_business_days(self, dt, n_days):
        if n_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(dt):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
                remain = dt - prev_open
                dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                dt = dt + skip_bd
        return dt

    def _apply_remaining_hours(self, dt, remaining_minutes):
        if remaining_minutes != 0:
            while remaining_minutes > 0:
                interval_end = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt))
                hours_within_interval = interval_end - dt
                if remaining_minutes < hours_within_interval.seconds // 60:
                    dt += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
                else:
                    remaining_minutes -= hours_within_interval.seconds // 60
                    dt = self._next_opening_time(dt + hours_within_interval)
        return dt
```

In the corrected version, we handle the adjustment of business days and remaining hours separately, ensuring that the frequency is propagated correctly to the `pd.date_range` function. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
