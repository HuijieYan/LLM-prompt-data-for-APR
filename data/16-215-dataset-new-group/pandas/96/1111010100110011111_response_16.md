The bug in the `apply` function is causing unexpected behavior in the Pandas `date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the adjustment of business hours when holidays are added, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the `date_range` output.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function are the calculations involving the adjustment of dates and times to account for holidays and business hours. The `if` conditions that handle adjusting `other` based on `n` appear to be the primary source of the issue.

The bug causes the `apply` function to produce more periods than expected, leading to unexpected results in the `date_range` function when holidays are added. This behavior does not conform to the expected input/output variable values mentioned.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the dates and times based on `n` and holidays needs to be reviewed and modified appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Remove existing implementation

        # New implementation
        if self.n > 0:
            delta = timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            delta = timedelta(hours=-1)
        
        holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
        
        while self.businesshour_count > 0:
            other += delta

            if other.date() in holidays:
                continue

            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                self.businesshour_count -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the adjustment logic to loop through the dates and times, incrementing or decrementing the datetime object based on the value of `n`. We also check for holidays and skip adjustment if the date is a holiday.

This corrected version should address the issue and ensure that the `date_range` function produces the expected number of periods when holidays are added.

Please note that the corrected function above is based on the assumption of the internal implementation of `CustomBusinessHour` and relevant related classes and objects. Additional testing may be required to ensure the correctness of the fix.
