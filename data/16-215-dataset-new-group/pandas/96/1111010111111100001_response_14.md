The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class arises from the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the business hours. The bug occurs when the business hours are adjusted by business days or by remaining business hours. This leads to an issue in calculating the remaining business hours that need to be adjusted.

The main cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting business hours is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect handling of business days and remaining business hours. Moreover, there is an inconsistency in handling the time intervals during the adjustment process.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling business days and remaining business hours should be revised to ensure proper adjustment of the business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n > 0:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
            if other.time() in self.start:
                n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            if other.time() in self.end:
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing this revised logic, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected `apply` function should pass the failing test case.
