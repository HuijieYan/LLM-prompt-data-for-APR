The buggy function apply(self, other) has several potential error locations, such as:
1. Improper validation of the 'other' parameter, leading to incorrect adjustments.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments.
3. Incorrect handling of business days and remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug, based on the GitHub issue, is that the CustomBusinessHour is not working correctly when using periods and adding holidays. This leads to unexpected behavior when generating DatetimeIndex.

To fix this bug, a possible strategy is to revise the logic in the apply() function to ensure that it correctly adjusts the datetime object based on the specified business hour and handles holidays properly.

Here's the corrected version of the apply() function to resolve the issue:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # handle holidays properly
        holiday_dates = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
        business_dates = [d for d in pd.date_range(start=other, periods=10, freq='B') if d not in holiday_dates]
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(other, business_dates)
        else:
            adjusted_date = self._prev_opening_time(other, business_dates)
        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
1. We handle holidays properly by checking if the date is within the list of holidays and adjusting accordingly.
2. We use the `_next_opening_time()` and `_prev_opening_time()` methods to adjust the datetime object based on the business hour, taking into account the list of business dates excluding holidays.

This revised logic should address the issue described in the GitHub post and fix any unexpected behavior when using CustomBusinessHour with periods and holidays.
