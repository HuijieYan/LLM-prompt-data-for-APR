The bug in the `apply` function seems to be causing issues when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays. The `apply` function is designed to reset time zone and nanosecond information from a given date. It then adjusts the date based on business hours, holidays, and other conditions. However, it appears that the adjustments are not being made correctly, resulting in incorrect output from `pd.date_range`. 

Upon reviewing the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables, it is clear that the `apply` function is not handling the adjustments to the date based on business hours and holidays correctly, leading to unexpected output. This inconsistency in handling holiday adjustments seems to be the root cause of the issue. 

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly adjust the date according to the specified business hours and holidays. It should also account for the edge cases and ensure that the adjustments are made accurately to produce the expected output from `pd.date_range`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Handle remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # Business hour left in this business time interval
                time_to_closing = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if time_to_closing < bhour_remain:
                    # Move to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= time_to_closing
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                time_to_opening = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if time_to_opening <= bhour_remain:
                    # Move to the next opening time
                    bhour_remain -= time_to_opening
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine a business hour with a datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue by correctly adjusting the date based on business hours and holidays, ensuring that the resulting date is as expected.

After fixing the `apply` function, the provided failing test should pass.
