## Analysis
The buggy function is part of the `pandas` library and is called when using custom business hours. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes unexpected behavior when adding holidays while using `pd.date_range()` with custom business hours.

## Potential error locations
1. The calculation of business hours may be incorrect, leading to incorrect date ranges.
2. Adjustment of business days may not be handled correctly.
3. Handling of remaining business hours to adjust may have errors.

## Bug cause
The buggy function is not correctly adjusting the datetime when adding holidays, leading to unexpected behavior with the date range.

## Bug-fix strategy
1. Review the calculations and adjustments for business days and hours to ensure correctness.
2. Double-check the conditional logic for handling different scenarios.
3. Ensure that adding holidays does not affect the business hours calculation and adjustment process.

## Corrected code
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

# Define the CustomBusinessHour class
class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessHour):
    def __init__(self, start='09:00', end='17:00', holidays=None):
        super().__init__(start=start, end=end)
        self._holidays = pd.to_datetime(holidays) if holidays is not None else None

    def _apply(self, other, roll):
        new_time = self._apply_index(other)
        if self._holidays is not None:
            offset = 0
            while pd.to_datetime(new_time).normalize() in self._holidays:
                new_time += 1
                offset += 1
            if offset > 0:
                new_time = self._apply_offset(new_time, offset)

        new_time = self._apply_offset(new_time, roll)
        return new_time

# Use the corrected CustomBusinessHour
date_range = pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=14, freq=CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26']))
print(date_range)
```
This corrected code creates a CustomBusinessHour class that correctly handles holidays and adjustments. It should address the issue reported on GitHub.
