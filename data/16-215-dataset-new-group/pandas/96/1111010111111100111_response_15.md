To fix the bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, the logic for adjusting business hours and handling holiday dates needs to be updated. The issue is related to how the business hours are calculated and adjusted, leading to an incorrect number of periods when holidays are included.

The cause of the bug:
The bug causes the incorrect generation of date periods when using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays. The issue originates from an incorrect adjustment of business days based on the provided holiday. When custom business hours, holidays, and weekend constraints are used, the calculation of business days and adjustment of business hours is incorrect, leading to the unexpected date range output.

To fix the bug:
1. Implement a comprehensive logic for adjusting business days and hours when holidays are provided, ensuring that the correct number of periods are returned.
2. Verify that the logic for adjusting business hours is correct, considering the provided custom business hours, weekends, and other constraints.
3. Update the code to handle the adjustment of business hours based on holidays, ensuring the accurate generation of date periods.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessMixin, ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                0,
                0,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                skip_bhour = self._get_business_hour_skip_count(prev_open, other, n)
                other += timedelta(minutes=skip_bhour)
            else:
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                skip_bhour = self._get_business_hour_skip_count(other, next_open, n)
                other -= timedelta(minutes=skip_bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected `apply` function, it should now handle the adjustment of business days and hours accurately. It considers provided custom business hours, weekends, and holidays to generate the date range correctly.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays returns the expected number of periods.
