The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to how it handles custom business hours and holidays. The buggy behavior is that when using custom business hours with holidays in combination with `pd.date_range`, it produces more periods than expected. This is clearly not the correct behavior.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic inside the `apply` function for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours. It seems that the handling of holidays is not properly implemented, causing the incorrect number of periods to be generated in certain scenarios.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `apply` function needs to be revisited, specifically the parts that handle adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours. It should take into account the presence of holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated.

Given the context and the buggy function, the corrected version is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class CustomBusinessHour:

    # ... (other methods remain the same)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if other.hour in range(self.start.hour, self.end.hour):
                        # move to the end of the current hour
                        other += timedelta(hours=1 - other.hour, minutes=60 - other.minute,
                                           seconds=60 - other.second)
                    elif other.hour < self.start.hour:  # before business hours
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                                         self.start.hour, 0, 0, tzinfo=None)
                    else:  # after business hours
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day + 1,
                                         self.start.hour, 0, 0, tzinfo=None)

                    if date(other.year, other.month, other.day) in self.holidays:
                        other += timedelta(days=1)  # move to the next day if it's a holiday
                    else:
                        n -= 1  # reduce the count of business hours

            else:  # n < 0 (moving backwards in time)
                while n < 0:
                    if other.hour in range(self.start.hour, self.end.hour + 1):
                        # move to the start of the current hour
                        other -= timedelta(hours=other.hour - self.start.hour, minutes=other.minute,
                                           seconds=other.second)
                    elif other.hour > self.end.hour:  # after business hours
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                                         self.end.hour, 0, 0, tzinfo=None)
                    else:  # before business hours
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day - 1,
                                         self.end.hour, 0, 0, tzinfo=None)

                    if date(other.year, other.month, other.day) in self.holidays:
                        other -= timedelta(days=1)  # move to the previous day if it's a holiday
                    else:
                        n += 1  # increase the count of business hours

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, adjustments have been added to handle holidays and ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when using custom business hours with `pd.date_range`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the presence of holidays.
