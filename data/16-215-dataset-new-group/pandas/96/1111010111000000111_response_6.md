The buggy `apply` function seems to be part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library. This function is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours, but the bug affects its ability to handle business holidays correctly.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a custom business hour frequency using `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])` and then generate a date range using this frequency. However, the output of the date range does not match the expected output. Instead of returning the expected 4 periods, it returns more than 14 due to the holidays not being handled properly.

The GitHub issue further confirms that when adding holidays, the `pd.date_range` function does not behave as expected, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function could be the handling of holidays, where the function seems to have issues adjusting the dates based on the specified holidays.

An appropriate strategy for fixing the bug could include revamping the logic for adjusting dates to ensure that they correctly account for holidays and produce the expected output for the given business hour frequency.

```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    # Existing functionality for datetime adjustment omitted for brevity
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays is not None:
            adjusted_date = other
            while adjusted_date.date() in self.holidays:
                # Skip the holiday and proceed to the next business day
                adjusted_date += timedelta(days=1)
            other = adjusted_date

        # Remaining functionality for business hour adjustment omitted for brevity

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, the logic for handling holidays has been added to ensure that when adjusting the datetime, the function will skip over holidays and proceed to the next business day. This should resolve the issue with incorrect date ranges when in the presence of holidays.
