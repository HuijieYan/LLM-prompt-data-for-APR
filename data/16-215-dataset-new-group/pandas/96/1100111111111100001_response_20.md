Looking at the buggy function and the test information, it seems there are issues with the logic within the `apply` function. The `apply` function contains several conditional blocks and different types of adjustments, making it complex and prone to errors. 

From the error message and the failing test, it is clear that the buggy function is not correctly accommodating custom business hours with holidays. This is likely due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function when handling holidays and business hours.

To fix the bug, I would suggest simplifying the logic in the `apply` function and ensuring that it handles custom business hours and holidays appropriately. This may involve re-evaluating the adjustments made to the input `other` based on holidays and business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
        
        # Adjust for business hours
        if self.n >= 0:
            while other.time() not in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, I have simplified the holiday and business hours adjustments, ensuring that holidays are handled appropriately and business hours are adjusted based on the conditions specified in the test case.

This revised logic should address the issues identified in the failing test and the error message, allowing the corrected function to pass the failing test.
