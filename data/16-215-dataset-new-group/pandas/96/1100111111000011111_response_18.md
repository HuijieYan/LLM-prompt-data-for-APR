## Correction of the buggy function

The correction of the buggy function involves fixing issues related to the calculation of business hours, handling holidays, and adjusting the datetime object.

```python
# Import required for resolving the issue
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if self._is_on_offset(other):  # Check if the input datetime is on the business hour offset
                return other
            
            # Adjust the input datetime based on the offset
            if n >= 0:
                if self._next_opening_time(other).time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._next_opening_time(other).time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate business hours
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Handling adjustment by business days
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            bd_adjustment = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday().apply(other)
            other = other + bd_adjustment
            
            # Handling remaining business hours
            r_adjustment = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while r_adjustment != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r_adjustment < bhour:
                    other += r_adjustment
                    r_adjustment = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    r_adjustment -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction involves checking for business hour offset, adjusting the input datetime, calculating business hours, and handling the adjustment by business days and remaining business hours. This updated code should resolve the issue and ensure the correct behavior of the `apply` function.
