The issue seems to be related to the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file. The method is used to adjust the input datetime based on business hours.

In the failing test, `pd.date_range` is used to generate a range of datetimes based on the custom business hours, but when holidays are added, the result contains more than the expected number of periods.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with validating the frequency and generating the range of datetimes.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `apply` method needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the apply method
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)
  
    # this is the corrected apply method
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0 and (self.end is None or other.time() in self.end):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and (self.start is None or other.time() in self.start):
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # add business days
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self.end - other if self.end is not None else self.next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = other - self.start if self.start is not None else other - self.next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.get_closing_time(self.next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays has been corrected to properly handle the specified custom business hours and holidays. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
