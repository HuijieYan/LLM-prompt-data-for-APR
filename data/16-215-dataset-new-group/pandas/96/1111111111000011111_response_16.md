The buggy function seems to be the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. 

The function is failing to correctly adjust the time based on business hours and holidays. It produces unexpected results by returning more periods than expected when holidays are specified.

The bug in the function could be due to incorrect handling of business hours, calculation of business days, and not considering holidays as non-business days.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly adjust the time based on business hours and holidays. It should also accurately calculate the number of business days to skip and properly handle non-business days due to holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = opening_time
        else:
            # If other is a non-business time due to holidays, move to the next opening time
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate the total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining minutes
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = opening_time + skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while r != 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                diff = self._next_opening_time(closing_time) - other
                if diff.total_seconds() // 60 <= r:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                    r -= diff.total_seconds() // 60
                else:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
        else:
            while r != 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                diff = next_opening - other
                if diff.total_seconds() // 60 < r:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1))
                    r -= diff.total_seconds() // 60
                else:
                    other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version of the function applies a better approach for adjusting the time based on business hours and holidays. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function produces the expected output.
