The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the `pd.date_range` function to behave incorrectly when using periods and adding a holiday. The bug is leading to more than the expected number of periods being generated.

The main cause of the bug is the improper handling of holidays within the `apply` function. This is evident from the GitHub issue posted, where the user observes incorrect behavior when adding holidays to the frequency. The use of the `apply` function to calculate business hours appears to be the root cause of the problem, ultimately leading to unexpected behavior in generating date ranges.

To fix this bug, the handling of holidays within the `apply` function needs to be addressed. The method for adding, checking, and adjusting for holidays within the business hours calculation should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure that the dates and periods are computed correctly even in the presence of holidays.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle holiday logic
            while other.date().isoformat() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
            
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n % 60)
            
            # handle the case for business days
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=(n // 60) // 9)
            other += skip_bd
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                else:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, the input `other` is adjusted properly based on business days and the remaining business hours to adjust. Moreover, an explicit check for holidays is included and handled in the logic to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for when generating date ranges. This should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect behavior of `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding a holiday.
