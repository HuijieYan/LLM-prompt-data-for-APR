The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime by a certain business hour offset. The error message suggests a problem with the validation of the frequency in relation to the values of a given Datetime Array/Index or Timedelta Array/Index.

The issue in the buggy function arises when the code tries to validate the frequency using the `_validate_frequency` method but fails to properly handle the non-fixed frequency.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the `_validate_frequency` method to properly handle non-fixed frequencies and raise an informative error message if the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the function remains the same

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

However, this is only a partial fix because the root cause of the error is outside the provided code. Since the bug is related to `_validate_frequency` method, it's likely that the actual bug resides there or in some higher-level logic that interacts with this method. To provide a complete fix, it's necessary to inspect and modify the logic or method that calls the `_validate_frequency` method. Unfortunately, the provided code doesn't contain enough context to make the correction.

Without access to the `_validate_frequency` method and its caller, providing a complete fix for the bug is not possible based on the given information.
