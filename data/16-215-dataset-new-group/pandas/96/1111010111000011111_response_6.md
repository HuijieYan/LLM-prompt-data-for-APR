The buggy function appears to be the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The test case that is failing is the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.

The issue seems to be related to the `date_range` method not working when using periods and adding a holiday. The expected behavior is not being achieved in the failing test case (`test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`) where it is producing more than 14 periods when a holiday is added.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments to the datetime object `other` within the `apply` method. The logic for handling business days and business hours might not be considering holidays correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, it will likely be necessary to review and potentially modify the logic for adjusting `other` based on business days and business hours to properly account for holidays as well.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Existing code...
        # (Keep the part of the code that resets timezone and nanosecond)

        # New code to handle holidays
        offset = self
        offset.holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', None)
        
        if offset.holidays:
            bday = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(holidays=offset.holidays, weekmask='Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri')
            # Adjust other to the next business day if it is a holiday
            while pd.to_datetime(other).normalize() in offset.holidays:
                other += bday

        # Existing code...
        # (Keep the rest of the code for adjusting business hours and days)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected version of the `apply` method should handle holidays correctly and ensure that the adjustments to the datetime object `other` are in line with the expected behavior.
