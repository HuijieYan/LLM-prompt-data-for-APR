The provided code has several issues:
1. Incorrect naming of the function decorator `@apply_wraps`. It is only used for method-based decorators in Python and here it is being used incorrectly.
2. The code contains many references to other methods and variables (`nanosecond`, `datetime`, etc.) that are not defined within the scope of the function. This may lead to NameError or AttributeError exceptions.

To fix the above issues, the function `apply` should be defined with the correct method-based decoration approach. Additionally, the required methods and variables need to be properly defined. Below is the modified version of the function considering these changes:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        @classmethod
        def apply_wraps(func):
            # Please define the body of this function
            pass
          
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # use other.replace() instead of constructing a new datetime object
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)
            
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust `other` based on the number of business days
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Other business logic...
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

For the implementation to work correctly, the missing functions such as `_get_closing_time`, `_next_opening_time`, and `_is_on_offset`, along with the required class `BusinessDay` and other required functions, need to be defined.
