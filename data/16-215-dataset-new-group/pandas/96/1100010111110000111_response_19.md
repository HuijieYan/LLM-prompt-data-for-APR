The bug in the `apply` function is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to produce incorrect output and raise a `ValueError`. This issue is also reported on GitHub as "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday", and it occurs when using `pd.date_range` with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays, leading to the creation of more than the expected number of periods in the output.

The bug is likely related to the logic inside the `apply` function, where adjustments are being made to the provided date based on the business hours. This seems to be causing the incorrect behavior and unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic inside the `apply` function to ensure that the adjustments for business hours and holidays are properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = as_datetime(other)
        
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # business hours in one business day
        businesshours = (self.end - self.start).seconds / 3600

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            businessdays = timedelta(days=bd)
            other = other + businessdays
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            else:
                # find next opening time if not on offset
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        if r != 0:
            businesshours = timedelta(minutes=r)
            offset = other.time() - self.start
            offset_in_mins = offset.seconds / 60 + offset.days * 24 * 60
            while offset_in_mins > 0:
                if n > 0:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                    business_left = (next_opening - other).seconds / 60
                else:
                    closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    business_left = (closing - other).seconds / 60
                if businesshours <= business_left:
                    return other + businesshours
                businesshours -= business_left
                offset_in_mins -= business_left
                other = next_opening
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are handled correctly, ensuring that the date is adjusted according to the business hours without raising any errors or producing incorrect results. This should resolve the reported bug and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass successfully.
