The buggy function `apply` is part of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. It seems to be attempting to apply custom business hours to a given datetime, with the goal of adjusting the datetime to the next open business time. The `datetime` module is being used alongside `timedelta` to perform these adjustments.

Upon review, it seems that the error message is quite complex and arises from the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimes.DatetimeArray` class, specifically the `_validate_frequency` method. The error is coming from a validation failure that occurs during a comparison of frequencies which involves the this inaccurate inferred frequency None from passed values that does not conform to passed frequency CBH. 

Given the complexity of the error message and the nature of the code, it seems likely that the bug could be due to incorrect adjustments to the datetime based on the custom business hours. It's possible that the adjustments are not being made correctly, leading to the frequency validation failure.

To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the datetime based on the custom business hours need to be reviewed, enhanced by adjusting business days, and remaining business hours. Ensure the adjustments correctly align with the business hours and do not introduce frequency validation issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Figure out if the datetime falls within a business hour
        if other.time() in self.start:
            start_index = self.start.index(other.time())
        elif other.time() in self.end:
            start_index = self.end.index(other.time())
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError('Datetime does not fall within a business hour')

        if self.n >= 0:
            if start_index == len(self.end) - 1 or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Move to the next opening time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if start_index == 0:
                # Move to the previous closing time
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            elif not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Move to the next opening time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Make remaining adjustments
        remaining_business_hours, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), self.business_hours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            remaining_business_hours, r = -remaining_business_hours, -r

        if remaining_business_hours != 0:
            # Number of business days to skip
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=remaining_business_hours)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle the adjustments to the datetime based on the custom business hours correctly and prevent the frequency validation failure. It should pass the failing test provided.
