The bug is causing a ValueError to be thrown when a frequency validation is performed on a datetime index. This bug is likely due to incorrect handling of business hours and business days, leading to the incorrect validation of a frequency in relation to the datetime index.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic inside the `apply` function according to its expected behavior and the provided test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other.replace(nanosecond=0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # adjust by business days first
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                business_day = self.next_bday
            else:
                business_day = BusinessDay(n=self.next_bday)
                other = business_day + other

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            remaining_minutes = abs(n) * 60
            business_hours_in_seconds = sum(
                (end - start).seconds for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(remaining_minutes * 60, business_hours_in_seconds)

            # adjust by business days first
            if business_days != 0:
                other += business_day

            # adjust remaining business hours
            while True:
                business_hours = (self._prev_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=business_hours_in_seconds)) - other if n < 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                if remaining_seconds == 0:
                    break
                if n >= 0:
                    if bhour_remain < business_hours:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_seconds -= business_hours.seconds
                        other += timedelta(business_hours_in_seconds)
                else:
                    if bhour_remain > business_hours or (bhour_remain == business_hours and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_seconds -= business_hours.seconds
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated `apply` function should correct the issues identified in the error message and the failing test, allowing it to pass all the test cases provided.

Hope this helps!
