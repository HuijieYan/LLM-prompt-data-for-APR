The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when adding holidays. The `apply` function is supposed to adjust the given datetime based on business hours, but it is producing incorrect output, as shown in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations in the `apply` function are the adjustments related to business days and remaining business hours. These calculations are likely causing the unexpected behavior when adding holidays.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustment for business days and the remaining business hours are not being handled correctly in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect datetime values being returned when using the `pd.date_range` function with holidays.

To fix the bug, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function need to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that the calculated datetime values align with the expected business hours and holidays configuration.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            while bd != 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)
                bd -= 1

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if n > 0:
            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the fixed version of the function, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are handled differently to ensure correct behavior when adding holidays. This should resolve the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
