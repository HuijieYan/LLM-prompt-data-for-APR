The cause of the bug in the provided function appears to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours and days for a given timestamp. The function attempts to adjust the timestamp based on certain conditions and business hours, but it seems to be mishandling these adjustments, leading to incorrect output.

To address the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Review the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure it accurately aligns with the intended behavior.
2. Check the conditions for moving to the next business time interval or previous business day, as well as the adjustments made based on the values of `n` and `other`.
3. Examine the cases where the function uses `self._next_opening_time` and `self._get_closing_time` to ensure their correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for next opening time if needed
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjust for previous business day or next opening time
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(n) * 60)

        if n < 0:
            # Adjust for previous business day or next opening time
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            # Adjust for future business hours
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours based on the value of `n` and `other`. It also uses a straightforward approach to handle the adjustments and ensure correct output.

Please test the corrected version with the given runtime input/output values to validate its functionality.
