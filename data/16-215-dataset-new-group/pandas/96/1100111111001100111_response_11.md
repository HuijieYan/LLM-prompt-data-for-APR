The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the failing test. The bug is likely related to the logic involving `BusinessDay` and `CustomBusinessHour` offsets when adjusting the datetime object for holidays and weekends. The failing test is calling the `pd.date_range` with a specific business frequency and holidays, but it's producing incorrect results, leading to the issue found on GitHub.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, it produces incorrect results. Instead of 14 periods, it produces more due to the incorrect handling of holidays and weekends when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the logic for adjusting dates when holidays and weekends are encountered within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. We also need to ensure that the adjustment of the dates using `BusinessDay` and `CustomBusinessHour` offsets is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other class methods and functions remain unchanged
    
    # Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Keep the time component but reset the date component
            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), other.time())
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # Handle holidays and weekends
            while True:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.weekday() >= 5 or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                else:
                    break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the logic for handling holidays and weekends, ensuring that the date adjustments are done correctly. This should fix the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
