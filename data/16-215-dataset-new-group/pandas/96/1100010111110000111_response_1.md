The buggy function `apply()` attempts to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours, but it fails to handle holidays correctly due to incorrect handling of business days. This results in unexpected behavior and errors, as evidenced by the failing test and the provided GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays and business days 
2. Inadequate handling of adjustments when business hours need to be skipped

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect adjustments and validation of business hours when holidays are present. This leads to inaccurate date ranges being generated, as reported in the failing test and described in the GitHub Issue.

To fix the bug, the `apply()` function should be modified to accurately handle business hours, holidays, and business days.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply()` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessHour
import pandas as pd

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        other = other.tz_localize(None)
        
        n = self.n
        business_hours = BusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
        
        if n >= 0:
            adjusted_date = business_hours.apply(other + pd.Timedelta(n, unit='h'))
        else:
            n = abs(n)
            adjusted_date = business_hours.apply(other - pd.Timedelta(n, unit='h'))
        
        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply()` function should now handle business days, holidays, and business hours correctly, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
