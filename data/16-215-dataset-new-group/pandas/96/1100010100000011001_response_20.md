I can see that there are multiple cases provided for expected input/output variable values in relation to the buggy function. The function itself is quite complex and involves a lot of logic, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the bug. 

To fix the bug, you would typically start by analyzing the logic inside the buggy function and compare it to the expected input/output values for each case. This could help identify discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual behavior of the function in different scenarios. 

Here's a rough step-by-step strategy you could follow to fix the bug:
1. Carefully review the logic inside the `apply` function and compare it with each of the expected cases provided.
2. Identify any conditional statements, loops, or variable assignments that might be causing the discrepancies between the expected and actual values.
3. Use print statements or a debugging tool to inspect the values of variables at various points within the function for each case. 
4. Compare the observed values with the expected values to determine where the code deviates from the expected behavior. 
5. Based on your findings, modify the function to ensure that it produces the expected output for each case.

Here's an attempt at fixing the buggy function based on the provided cases and the strategy mentioned above:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # reset timezone and nanosecond - replaced `datetime` with `fromdatetime`
        other = fromdatetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
              other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining logic
        # ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

It's important to note that without the full context of the code and the various classes or methods used within the `apply` function, the fix provided above is just a general example of the approach that could be taken to try and address the bug. Additional testing and verification would be necessary to ensure that the fixed function produces the expected output for all cases.
