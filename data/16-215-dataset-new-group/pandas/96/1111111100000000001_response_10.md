The buggy function `apply` is trying to calculate the datetime of the next business hour, but it contains many if-else conditions and potentially incorrectly implemented logic. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of business days and business hours.
2. Potentially incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business hour.
3. Undefined variables or missing class references.

The buggy function can cause erroneous calculations and incorrect output due to the complex logic and multiple if-else conditions.

To fix the bug:
1. Validate the logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business hour.
2. Ensure proper handling of business days and business hours within the function.
3. Check for undefined variables and missing class references.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function `apply`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate remaining business hours in the day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_day = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + business_day + remain
            else:
                other += business_day

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, I have made adjustments to the logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business hour. I simplified some of the conditionals and improved the handling of business days and business hours. Additionally, I made sure to use the correct class references.
