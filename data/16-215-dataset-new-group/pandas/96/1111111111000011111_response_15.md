## The issue with the buggy code

The buggy function is not returning the expected datetime values and types of variables for the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()`. The failing test case uses `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`, and the `pd.date_range()` function with custom holidays to create a datetime index. However, the buggy function is not functioning as expected and is returning incorrect datetime values for the given periods and frequencies.

The utilization of the involved classes and functions from the `pandas.tests.indexes.datetimes.test_date_range.py` file show that the current implementation of the buggy function is not as per the expected behavior and is failing to return the correct output based on the input parameters.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. First, the buggy function needs to correctly manipulate the datetime values and related parameters to ensure that they align with the intended custom business hours and holidays.
2. The adjustments made to the `other` datetime object must accurately reflect the custom business hours and holidays to produce the expected datetime index values.
3. The logic for adjusting `other` based on `self._is_on_offset()` and the subsequent steps related to business days and business hours must be reviewed and corrected to ensure the accurate calculation of datetime values.
4. Appropriate adjustments in the logic should be made to ensure that the correct business days and business hours are being accounted for in the calculation.

```

The corrected version of the buggy function includes adjustments to the logic for handling business days, business hours, and the manipulation of the `other` datetime object. Additionally, a new method `_adjust_business_hours` has been introduced to provide more modular and clear adjustments to the business hours based on the remaining duration.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the corrected function should now return the expected datetime index values for the given periods and frequencies with custom holidays.
