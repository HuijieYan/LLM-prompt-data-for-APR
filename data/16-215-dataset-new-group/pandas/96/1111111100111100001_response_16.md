The buggy function `apply` imparts an error because it does not appropriately handle business hours for a given date and time. This results in the ValueError error message when the `_validate_frequency` is raised. The cause of the bug can be traced back to the logic within the `apply` function where it manipulates the `other` timestamp to calculate the next business day. The absence of proper checks and handling for edge cases leads to the incorrect adjustment of the business hours.

I suggest refactoring the code by adding some conditionals and recalculating the business hours based on the provided date and time to handle custom business hours and days appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd = abs(n) // business_hours
        r = abs(n) % (business_hours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd = -bd
            r = -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I added conditionals to appropriately handle adjustments for business days and calculate remaining business hours. This version addresses the edge conditions which were not previously handled and should resolve the failing tests.
