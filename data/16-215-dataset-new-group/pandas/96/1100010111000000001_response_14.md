The issue in the buggy function is likely related to the calculation of business hours and the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. The failing test is related to creating a date range with custom business hours and expected to exclude a holiday. 

The bug seems to be that the implementation of the `CustomBusinessHour` does not correctly handle the given custom business hours and holidays. The resulting date range includes the holiday date "2020-11-26" which should have been excluded. 

To fix this bug, the logic for handling holidays and custom business hours needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the calculations for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours may need to be corrected. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling holidays and adjusting the datetime based on custom business hours has been updated. This corrected version should pass the failing test for creating date ranges with custom business hours and excluding holidays.
