The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has multiple issues that need to be addressed.

Potential error locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` to reduce the number of cases to handle is not done correctly.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours and business days leads to incorrect results.
3. The condition for adjusting by business days first is causing the incorrect output.
4. The while loops for adjusting remaining business hours are not handling the adjustment correctly.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function incorrectly calculates the adjusted datetime for CustomBusinessHour with holidays. It fails to adjust the datetime correctly, resulting in extra periods when holidays are added.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust `other` correctly to reduce the number of cases to handle.
2. Correctly calculate business hours and business days in the adjusted datetime.
3. Handle the adjustment by business days first and adjust the remaining business hours accurately.
4. Update the condition checks and loops to handle the adjustment correctly.

Given below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay, ApplyTypeError

            )
            business_days = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), total_hours // 60)
            
            if self.n < 0:
                business_days = (-business_days[0], -business_days[1])
                
            hours_to_adjust = timedelta(minutes=business_days[1])
            if business_days[0] != 0:

                    hours_in_interval = closing_time - other

                    if hours_to_adjust <= hours_in_interval:

            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the function, the issues with adjusting the datetime for CustomBusinessHour with holidays should be resolved. The `apply` method now correctly handles the adjustment of the datetime, including the calculation of business hours and days, and correctly adjusts for remaining business hours. After making these changes, the failing test should pass, effectively resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
