The issue with the buggy function seems to be in the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on CustomBusinessHour, start time, end time, and holidays. It appears that some of the condition checks and adjustments may not be correctly implemented, resulting in incorrect datetime calculations.

To fix this, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hour, holidays, and start/end time needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, there are some issues with accessing class attributes and comparing time intervals that need to be addressed.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import the required libraries
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the corrected function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = self.start[0]
        end_time = self.end[0]

        # Adjust the other datetime to reduce the number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(hour=start_time.hour, minute=start_time.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        # Adjust other based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= end_time or other.weekday() in [5, 6] or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= start_time:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if other.weekday() in [5, 6] or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = (end_time.hour - start_time.hour) * 60

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd, start=start_time, end=end_time, holidays=self.holidays)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = (datetime.combine(other.date(), end_time) - other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    if other.time() != end_time or other.time() == end_time and other.nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
- I fixed the adjustment logic based on business hours, holidays, and other parameters.
- Ensured proper comparison of time intervals and access to class attributes.

This corrected function should resolve the issues and pass the failing test.
