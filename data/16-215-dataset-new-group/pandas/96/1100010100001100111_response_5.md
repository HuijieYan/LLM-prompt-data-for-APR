The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function is not handling the adjustment to the business hours properly when adding holidays. This results in an incorrect number of periods being generated when using the `pd.date_range` function with the holiday parameter.

To fix this bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be modified to account for holidays when calculating the business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # handle holidays
        while other in self.holidays:
            other += self._get_offset()

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            while bd != 0:
                bd_delta = bd // abs(bd) if self._is_on_offset(other) else bd
                other += bd_delta * self._get_offset()
                bd -= bd_delta

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_business_hours_between_offsets(other, n < 0)
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_next_offset_time(other, n < 0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Note: The updated logic includes handling holidays within the adjustment process and properly calculating business hours between offsets. This should address the issue with generating an incorrect number of periods when using the `pd.date_range` function with the holiday parameter.
