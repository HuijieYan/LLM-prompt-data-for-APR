Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the bug seems to be due to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime `other` in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The adjustment logic to handle positive and negative offsets seems to be causing the issue.

Upon analysis, it appears that the bug may be producing an incorrect output by not correctly adjusting the `other` datetime when working with positive and negative offsets.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for positive and negative offsets needs to be revisited. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime when `n >= 0` and `n < 0` needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other + timedelta(seconds=-1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on correctly adjusting the `other` datetime based on the positive and negative offsets. With this corrected logic, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
