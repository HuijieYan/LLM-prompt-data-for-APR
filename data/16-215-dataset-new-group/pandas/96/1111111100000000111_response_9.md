The buggy function `apply` is causing unexpected behavior in the output of the `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The issue description from GitHub indicates that using periods and adding holidays results in more than the specified number of periods when the `date_range` is generated.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of holidays in the `apply` function. Due to this mishandling, the function is not correctly adjusting the number of periods when holidays are included, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve modifying the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjust the number of periods when generating the business hour time intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# Import the required modules
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # Updated apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Handle holidays
            is_holiday = getattr(other, "date", False) in self.holidays

            if is_holiday:
                other = self.next_bday(other)

            # Calculate business hours and adjust for holidays
            hours_to_add = []
            if self.n >= 0:
                while len(hours_to_add) < abs(self.n):
                    start_dt = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
                    if start_dt.weekday() in (5, 6) or start_dt.date() in self.holidays:
                        start_dt = self.next_bday(start_dt)
                    business_hr_end = start_dt.replace(hour=self.end.hour, minute=self.end.minute)
                    hours_to_add.append(business_hr_end)
                    other = self.next_bday(business_hr_end)
            else:
                while len(hours_to_add) < abs(self.n):
                    start_dt = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
                    if start_dt.weekday() in (5, 6) or start_dt.date() in self.holidays:
                        start_dt = self.prev_bday(start_dt)
                    business_hr_start = start_dt.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
                    hours_to_add.append(business_hr_start)
                    other = self.prev_bday(business_hr_start)

            return hours_to_add
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function now correctly handles holidays by checking if the date is a holiday and adjusting the business hours accordingly to take the holidays into account. This should resolve the issue when using the `date_range` function with periods and adding holidays.
