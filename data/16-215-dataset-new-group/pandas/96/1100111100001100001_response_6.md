The bug in the function is causing issues with adjusting the datetime objects based on business hours and days. The bug seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the datetime to reduce the number of cases to handle.

The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours and days specified in the CustomBusinessHour class. It checks if the datetime is on or off the offset and makes adjustments accordingly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days.
2. Possible issues with checking if the datetime is on or off the offset.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the datetime and checking if it's on or off the offset is not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect adjustments when handling different cases of datetimes with respect to business hours and days.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime and checking if it's on or off the offset needs to be thoroughly reviewed and updated. Additionally, the logic for reducing the number of cases to handle should be revisited to ensure that all edge cases are properly accounted for.

Here's a corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments based on business hours and days are simplified, and the logic for checking if the datetime is on or off the offset is updated to address the issues observed in the buggy function.
