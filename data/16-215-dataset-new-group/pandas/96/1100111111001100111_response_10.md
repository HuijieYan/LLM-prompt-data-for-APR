The bug appears to be in the CustomBusinessHour apply function because it is incorrectly calculating the business hours based on the input datetime and the number of periods. The issue seems to be related to calculating the next business day and adjusting for business hours. The failing test is a part of a GitHub issue related to incorrect behavior when adding holidays and using periods in the pd.date_range with CustomBusinessHour.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in the calculation of business hours, adjusting the number of business days, and managing business hours to adjust the input datetime.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve correctly calculating the business hours for each day, adjusting the input datetime based on holidays and business days, and correctly handling the periods.

Here's the corrected version of the apply function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Calculate the number of business days
        n = self.n
        
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
            # If it's a negative number of business days, adjust the values
            if n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                n += 1
        
            # Get the total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust the input datetime based on business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            # Adjust the remaining business hours
            while r != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:  # Positive business days
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._prev_opening_time(next_opening)) - other
                    if r < bhour:  
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += r
                        r = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        r -= bhour
                        other = next_opening  # Move to next business time interval
                else:  # Negative business days
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r > bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += r
                        r = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        r -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrective changes, the CustomBusinessHour apply function should now return the correct datetime values and align with the expected behavior for handling holidays and periods. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
