The buggy function is failing because it is not correctly adjusting the datetime `other` based on the business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. It is also not taking into account the holidays specified when calculating the adjusted datetime.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic inside the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class to properly account for the specified business hours, holidays, and the adjustments needed to achieve the correct datetime based on the input `other` and `n` values.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # ... other class methods ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                other = datetime(
                    other.year,
                    other.month,
                    other.day,
                    other.hour,
                    other.minute,
                )

                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                bdays = n // 9
                if bdays != 0:
                    skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bdays)
                    other = other + skip_bd * 24  # 24 hours in a day

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing tests pass. It addresses the adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on the business hours and holidays specified, and correctly handles the case when `self` is an instance of `CustomBusinessHour`.
