Based on the detailed analysis, we can identify a potential error location within the buggy function. The main issue seems to be when adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour frequency, which causes the date_range periods to be inaccurate.

The bug seems to be caused by the apply function within the CustomBusinessHour class, specifically, the handling of holidays and the logic for adjusting the business hours.

The code does not correctly account for holidays when using the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to unexpected behavior in the date_range function as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we suggest re-implementing the apply function and ensuring that it correctly handles holidays when adjusting the business hours for the given frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the apply function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # other = datetime - _epst(other,datetime) :
        if np.isbusday(other, holidays=self.holidays):
            return other
        adj = self.onOffset(other)
        if adj:
            return other
        n = self._offset(n)
        new_date = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0)
        hour = other.hour
        minute = other.minute
        ctr = 0
        holiday_ctr = 0
        while ctr < n:
            new_date, hour, minute = add_custom_business_hour(
                new_date, hour, minute)
            if not np.isbusday(new_date):
                holiday_ctr += 1
            else:
                ctr += 1
        return new_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we evaluate the holidays with the `np.isbusday` function and adjust the business hours accordingly. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the date_range function works as expected with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

After applying this fix, a re-run of the failing test cases should confirm that the bug has been resolved.
