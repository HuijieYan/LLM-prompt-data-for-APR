The buggy function is the apply method inside the BusinessHourMixin class. The purpose of this method is to adjust a given datetime according to business hours, taking into account offsets such as start and end times, holidays, and weekends. However, the function contains several bugs that lead to incorrect adjustments and return values. The bugs are related to the calculation and adjustment of business days, remaining business hours, and updating the datetime according to business time intervals.

To fix the bugs in the apply method, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Ensure that all calculations involving business days, business hours, and time intervals are handled correctly to adjust the datetime accurately according to business hours.
2. Verify the conditional statements and loops to correctly execute the adjustment logic based on the given business hours and offsets.

Here is the corrected version of the apply method in the BusinessHourMixin class:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + business_day_offset
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            # Adjust based on the remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours have been implemented correctly. Additionally, the conditional statements and loops have been updated to ensure the accurate adjustment of the datetime based on business hours and offsets.
