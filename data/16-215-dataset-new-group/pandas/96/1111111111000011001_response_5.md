The buggy function `apply` has numerous issues, primarily with the logic and flow of the code. Several parameters, like `self.next_bday`, `st`, `en`, `start`, `end` are used without any reference or explanation.

The strategy to fix the bug should involve revisiting the logic, properly defining and initializing the parameters, and adding proper error handling. The refactored code needs to ensure that it follows the expected input/output values for the failed test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the function `apply`:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
```

The corrected version of the function should resolve the logical errors to meet the expected input/output values for the failed test cases.
