First, we'll analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the `BusinessHourMixin` class and the specific values of `other` and `self` that are used as input. 

The `apply` function is apparently designed to adjust a given `other` datetime value according to business hour rules specified within the `self` instance of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The purpose is to calculate a new datetime based on the number of business hours (self.n) and the business hour rules defined by `self.start` and `self.end`. 

However, several calculations within the function seem to be causing issues, as evidenced by the failed test cases. These issues likely stem from the manipulation of the `other` datetime value and the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.

Based on the observations, the fundamental cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect manipulation and calculation of the new `other` datetime value within the function. 

To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to accurately calculate the desired datetime based on the business hour rules.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fixed apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_other = other
        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        # Adjust business days first
        if n != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            adjusted_other += skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=self._get_remaining_minutes(adjusted_other, self.end))
            adjusted_other += bhour_remain
        else:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=self._get_remaining_minutes(adjusted_other, self.start))
            adjusted_other -= bhour_remain
        
        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjusted datetime is computed by appropriately adjusting business days first, and then handling the remaining business hours based on the directionality of `n`. This logic is implemented separately for positive and negative values of `n` to accurately calculate the adjusted `other` datetime. Additionally, there are separate methods `self._next_opening_time` and `self._get_closing_time` that are used to compute the next opening time and the closing time based on the provided `self` attribute. 

These changes address the bug and provide a more accurate calculation of the adjusted datetime based on the given business hour rules and the input `other` datetime value.
