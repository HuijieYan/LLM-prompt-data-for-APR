The buggy function is not handling the `CustomBusinessHour` offset correctly, which is causing the `ValueError` to be raised in the test cases. The issue seems to be related to the adjustments and calculations made in the function. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours and days specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

The bug causes the function to incorrectly adjust the datetime object, leading to errors. The relevant variables used in the adjustments, such as `businesshours`, `bd`, `r`, and `bhour_remain`, do not seem to be appropriately applied, resulting in incorrect adjustments to the datetime object.

To fix the bug, the adjustments and calculations in the function need to be reviewed carefully, ensuring that the correct business hours and days are accounted for, and that the adjustments are made accurately based on the offset's specifications.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments to the `other` datetime object are made accurately based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, and the edge cases are handled correctly. This should resolve the `ValueError` and ensure that the function functions as intended.
