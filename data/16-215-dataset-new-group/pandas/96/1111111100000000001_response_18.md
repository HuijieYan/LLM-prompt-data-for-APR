The buggy function contains multiple potential error locations, including:
1. Incorrect function calls such as `self._is_on_offset(other)` and `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`
2. Incorrect variable assignment within conditional statements
3. Logical errors in the while loops
4. Incorrect raise statement at the end of the function

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the date and time manipulation correctly, which results in inaccurate adjustments for business hours.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Check the function calls to `self._is_on_offset` and `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` to ensure that they are being used correctly.
2. Verify the logic within the conditional statements to ensure that the variables are being assigned the correct values based on the conditions.
3. Review the while loops to ensure that they are correctly handling the adjustment of business hours.
4. Correct the raise statement at the end of the function to ensure that it is raising the correct exception.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions remain unchanged
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise TypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the problematic function calls and logical errors in the conditional statements and while loops have been addressed and fixed. Additionally, the raise statement at the end of the function has been corrected to raise the appropriate exception.
