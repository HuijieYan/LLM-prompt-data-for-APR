The buggy function has logic error that causes it to return incorrect values where it should correctly handle business hours and holidays. The variable 'other' is supposed to be adjusted based on the CustomBusinessHour object, but the logic seems to be flawed as evidenced by the failing tests.

The buggy function tries to compute a new datetime based on business hours and holidays, but the logic for all conditions is incorrect.

The corrected version of the function can be updated to use the correct logic for adjusting the 'other' datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour objects and business hours.

Here's a corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            business_time = other
            while n > 0:
                business_time = business_time + pd.Timedelta(hours=1)
                if business_time.isoweekday() in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and business_time not in self.holidays:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            business_time = other
            while n < 0:
                business_time = business_time - pd.Timedelta(hours=1)
                if business_time.isoweekday() in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and business_time not in self.holidays:
                    n += 1                

        return business_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version above assumes that the pandas library is imported where it is required for the testing. This version improves the logic used to calculate the business time, properly accounting for holidays and the direction of the time shift.

With this corrected implementation, the mentioned failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully.
