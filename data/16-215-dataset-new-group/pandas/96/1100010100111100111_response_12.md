The buggy function contains several issues. The function is intended to apply a custom business hour frequency to the input datetime. However, there are potential errors related to the handling of business days, business hours, and holiday adjustments.

- The `apply` function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours, leading to unexpected results.
- There is a `ValueError` raised during the test execution due to incompatible holiday adjustments in the CustomBusinessHour.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for adjusting business days, business hours, and holiday considerations. I will correct these points and provide a fixed version of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the datetime is on a holiday and make necessary adjustments
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust the datetime based on the business hours
        start = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.start.hour,
            self.start.minute,
        )
        end = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.end.hour,
            self.end.minute,
        )

        # Check if the datetime is within business hours and make necessary adjustments
        if other < start:
            other = start
        elif other >= end:
            other = self._next_opening_time(start)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to correctly adjust the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour. It includes proper handling of business hours, holidays, and adjustments.

This updated logic should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and allow the `date_range` function to work as expected with the custom business hour frequency and holidays.
