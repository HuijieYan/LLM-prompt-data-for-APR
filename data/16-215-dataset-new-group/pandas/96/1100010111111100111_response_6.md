The bug in the function `apply()` is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to produce an incorrect result. The test is supposed to create a date range with custom business hours, but due to the bug, it is generating more than 14 periods when holidays are added to the CustomBusinessHour.

The cause of the bug in the `apply()` function is that the adjustment of the date and time for holidays is not being handled correctly. It results in the date range including more periods than expected, causing the test to fail.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic within the `apply()` function to ensure that the adjustment for holidays and custom business hours is correctly calculated.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply()` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if (n >= 0 and bhour_remain <= bhour) or (n < 0 and bhour_remain < bhour):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected function, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now produce the expected result without additional periods.
