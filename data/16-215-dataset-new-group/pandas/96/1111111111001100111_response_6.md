The bug in the `apply` function is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays. The function fails to adjust the date correctly when holidays are present, leading to incorrect outputs.

The bug seems to be related to the calculations and adjustments made within the `apply` function, specifically when handling the `other` date and determining the business days and hours to adjust.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic within the `apply` function and ensure that the adjustments for holidays and business days are correctly handled.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        adjust = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(n=n, start=self.start, end=self.end, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
        return other + adjust
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function directly leverages the `CustomBusinessHour` offset class to handle the adjustments based on business hours, holidays, and business days. By using this class and its functionalities, we can ensure that the adjustments are calculated correctly.

With this corrected version, the `pd.date_range` function should now produce the expected results, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
