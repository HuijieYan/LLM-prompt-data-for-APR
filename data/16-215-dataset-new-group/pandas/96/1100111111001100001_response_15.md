The bug in the given function is causing the failing test. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays. However, due to a logical error, the adjusted datetime is not being correctly calculated in some scenarios.

The root cause of the bug is in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays. There are multiple conditions and calculations involving business hours, holidays, and date adjustments, and some of them are not correctly handling the given input parameters, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logical flow of the adjustment process needs to be carefully reviewed, and each step should be validated against the expected behavior. Some adjustments to the comparison conditions and branching logic might be necessary to ensure that the datetime is adjusted correctly based on the provided business hours and holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the analysis above:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hours calculation
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the logical issues and should now produce the expected results for the failing test.
