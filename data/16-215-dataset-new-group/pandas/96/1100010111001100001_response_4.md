In the given buggy function, there is a flawed logic in the calculation of the adjusted time for a custom business hour. The problem arises from the handling of the adjustment of business days and business hours. This leads to incorrect time adjustments and returning the wrong result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and business hours is handled correctly, and the adjusted time is calculated accurately based on the input parameters. Additionally, in the correction, we need to handle the case when other is a pandas Timestamp.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other

        # Loop to adjust business days first
        if n != 0:
            business_day_offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=n)
            adjusted_time = pd.Timestamp(business_day_offset.apply(adjusted_time))

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        business_hour_offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(**self.kwds)
        adjusted_time += pd.Timedelta(minutes=n * business_hour_offset.freq.base)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with Timestamp")
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when other is a pandas Timestamp, and accurately compute the adjusted time based on the input parameters. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct adjusted time for custom business hours.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
