The buggy function `apply` is not handling the offset correctly when using `CustomBusinessHour`. Specifically, the bug is caused by the improper handling of custom business hours, which results in the `ValueError` related to the inferred and passed frequency not conforming to each other.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the business hours and adjust the given datetime according to the custom business hours. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, BaseOffset):
            base_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0)
            minutes = divmod(other.hour * 60 + other.minute, 60)[1]
            offset = self.nanos / 60000000000
            
            if self.onOffset(other) and minutes >= self.n and self.next_offset(other) >= base_time:
                return other
            elif self.onOffset(other) and minutes >= self.n:
                return self.next_offset(other)
            elif self.onOffset(other) and minutes < self.n and self.negative_offset(other) > base_time:
                return self.negative_offset(other)
            elif self.onOffset(other) and minutes < self.n:
                return self.negative_offset(other)
            else:
                if divmod(self._minutes_to_midnight(other), 60)[1] - minutes >=  self.n or self.negative_offset(other) > self.next_offset(other):
                    return self.next_offset(other)
                else:
                    return self.negative_offset(other)
        
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version of the `apply` function should ensure that the offset will be correctly adjusted to fit the custom business hours, and as a result, the failing test should be passed.
