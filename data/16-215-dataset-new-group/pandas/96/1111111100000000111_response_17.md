The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of datetime objects. The bug causes the `CustomBusinessHour` to generate more periods than expected when holidays are added.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the adjustments of `other` datetime object, the calculation of business hours, and the handling of holidays.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of datetime objects when holidays are added. This results in the `CustomBusinessHour` generating more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments of datetime objects are correctly handled, including the consideration of holidays in the calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# ... (other functions and imports remain unchanged)

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Add holiday check and adjustment
        if self._is_holiday(other):
            # If the day is a holiday, move to the next business day
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # ... (the remaining logic remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Holiday check function
def _is_holiday(self, dt):
    # Implement the logic to check if the given date is a holiday
    # For example, you can check against a list of holiday dates
    return dt in self.holidays
```

In the corrected version, a new function `_is_holiday` is added to check if the given date is a holiday. This function is used to adjust the `other` datetime object accordingly before performing the business hour calculations.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `CustomBusinessHour` behaves as expected, even when holidays are added.
