### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the issue

The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is used in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file to perform business hour-related calculations. The issue on GitHub also describes a problem with `date_range` when using a custom business hour frequency and adding holidays.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

One potential error location within the `apply` function is the adjustment of business days and the remaining business hours. There might be an issue in the calculation of business days and adjusting the remaining business hours, leading to unexpected behavior when combined with custom business hours and holidays.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The error message suggests that there is a `ValueError` occurring during the validation of the frequency when using `date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and adding holidays. This indicates that the validation of the frequency is failing due to inappropriate calculation or adjustment within the `apply` method. The GitHub issue also reports similar behavior where adding holidays to the custom business hour frequency leads to unexpected periods in the output.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` method. Additionally, we should ensure that the validation of the custom business hour frequency takes holidays into account properly.
