The bug in the `apply` function causes unexpected results when adding a holiday to a CustomBusinessHour frequency, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

Analysis of the bug:
The bug appears to be related to adjusting the time interval based on holidays and business hours within the `apply` function. This causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to occur when adjusting the time to account for holidays and business hours. The function tries to adjust the other time based on the business hours and holidays, but the adjustment logic is flawed, leading to incorrect datetime values.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the time intervals based on holidays and business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime are accurate and result in the expected output for the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            next_interval = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if next_interval.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_interval
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By focusing on adjusting the time intervals accurately, the corrected function should resolve the issue of unexpected datetime results when adding a holiday and using periods with the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
