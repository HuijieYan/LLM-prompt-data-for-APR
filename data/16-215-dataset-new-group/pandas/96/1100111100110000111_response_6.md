The buggy function `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module is causing the `ValueError` in the `pandas.tests.indexes.datetimes.test_date_range.py` test. The error message suggests that the issue is related to `pd.date_range` when using the `periods` parameter and adding holidays.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function is not considering holidays correctly when calculating business hours. This results in more periods being generated than expected. The function does not properly adjust the datetime object for holidays, leading to extra business hours being added to the output.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to account for holidays in the business hour calculation. Additionally, the function should be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        # Check for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Date is a holiday")

        # Check for weekends
        if other.weekday() >= 5:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Date is a weekend")

        # Calculate total business hours
        business_hours = (self.end - self.start).total_seconds() // 3600
        num_days, remainder = divmod(n * 60, business_hours // 60)

        # Adjust by business days first
        if num_days != 0:
            other_date = other.date()
            while num_days != 0:
                business_day = timedelta(days=(1 if n > 0 else -1))
                other_date += business_day

                # Check for holidays and weekends
                while other_date in self.holidays or other_date.weekday() >= 5:
                    other_date += business_day

                num_days -= 1

            other = datetime.combine(other_date, self.start)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        adjusted_time = other.time()
        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(hours=remainder / 60)

        # Find the next opening time
        next_open = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start)
        next_open += timedelta(days=1 if adjusted_time > self.end.time() else 0)

        # Perform adjustments for remaining business hours
        while remaining_business_hours.total_seconds() > 0:
            time_diff = self.end - adjusted_time
            if time_diff < remaining_business_hours:
                remaining_business_hours -= time_diff
                other = next_open
                next_open = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start)
                adjusted_time = self.start.time()
                next_open += timedelta(1)

            else:
                other += remaining_business_hours
                remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)

    return other
else:
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have included logic to handle holidays and weekends, as well as refactored the remaining business hour adjustment using a more readable and maintainable approach. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub page and resolve the failing test case.
