The buggy function lacks proper documentation but appears to be calculating business days and hours based on given input parameters. However, there are multiple issues within the function that may lead to inaccurate results. The code is complex and includes conditional statements and loops, making it hard to decipher the exact logic.

To fix the bug, the following steps should be taken:

1. Carefully analyze the expected input/output values to understand the expected outcomes for various test cases.

2. Simplify the conditional statements and loops to ensure clarity and precision in the function's logic.

3. Make sure to handle different conditions for positive and negative values of `n`, ensuring the accurate calculation of business days and business hours.

4. Review the process of updating the `other` parameter during each conditional check to make sure that it is effectively tracking the business day/hour.

5. Properly handle the edge cases to correctly calculate the new values of `other` after adjustments.

6. Verify that the `businesshours` variable is correctly calculated based on the given `start` and `end` parameters.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Different cases for positive and negative n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(days=1)  # Increment date by one day
                if other.weekday() < 5:  # Check if it's a weekday
                    n -= 1
                businesshours -= self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[other.weekday()], self.end[other.weekday()])
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)  # Decrement date by one day
                if other.weekday() < 5:  # Check if it's a weekday
                    n += 1
                businesshours -= self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[other.weekday()], self.end[other.weekday()])

        remaining_hours = n * 60
        while remaining_hours > 0:
            if other.time() < self.start[other.weekday()]:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[other.weekday()])
                remaining_hours -= (self.start[other.weekday()] - other.time()).seconds / 60
            elif other.time() > self.end[other.weekday()]:
                other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[other.weekday()])
                remaining_hours -= (other.time() - self.end[other.weekday()]).seconds / 60
            else:
                remaining_hours -= 60
        
        return other + timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hours with datetime")
```

Please use the corrected function for accurately calculating the adjusted `other` based on the given input parameters.
