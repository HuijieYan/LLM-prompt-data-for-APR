Looking at the buggy function, we can see that it tries to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays. However, there seems to be a potential issue with the logic within this function, where it incorrectly handles the adjustment of the business day and remaining business hours.

The potential cause of the bug is related to the incorrect calculation of business days (bd) and remaining business hours (r) when adjusting the datetime.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the adjustment logic for business days and remaining hours. Additionally, we may need to revisit the calculation of business hours and the usage of the CustomBusinessHour class within the function.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = opening_time
                while n > 0:
                    if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = opening_time + timedelta(days=n)
                        n = 0
                    else:
                        other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                        n -= 1
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = opening_time
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    n += 1

        remaining_minutes = n * 60

        if remaining_minutes >= businesshours:
            business_days = remaining_minutes // businesshours
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)
            remaining_minutes -= business_days * businesshours

        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_minutes > 0:
                bhour = closing_time - other
                if remaining_minutes < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
                else:
                    remaining_minutes -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
        else:
            while remaining_minutes < 0:
                bhour = other - opening_time
                if abs(remaining_minutes) < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(remaining_minutes))
                    remaining_minutes = 0
                else:
                    remaining_minutes += bhour.seconds // 60
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(opening_time)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the function above, it should now handle the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours correctly, ensuring that the datetime is adjusted as expected.
