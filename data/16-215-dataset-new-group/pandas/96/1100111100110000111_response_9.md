Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `apply` is not handling the custom business hours correctly when holidays are involved. This is causing `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected, as described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug lies in the way the `apply` function handles adjustments and business hours when holidays are involved. The logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours contains errors, causing the unexpected behavior when holidays are included in the business hour frequency.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles the adjustments for holidays and business hours. We also need to verify the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that should resolve the reported issue and pass the failing test:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp


class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            if self.on_offset(other):
                # If the timestamp is on the offset, no adjustment is needed
                return other
            else:
                # Adjust the timestamp based on the business hours
                business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
                return business_hour.rollforward(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # Method to check if the timestamp is on the business hour offset
    def on_offset(self, ts):
        return (ts.time() >= self.start) and (ts.time() < self.end)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `apply` function utilizes the `CustomBusinessHour` with start, end, and holidays when adjusting the timestamps. We also add a method to the `BusinessHourMixin` class to check if a timestamp is on the business hour offset.

Please note that the corrected version assumes that the `BusinessHourMixin` class contains the necessary properties for start, end, and holidays, as well as a method called `on_offset` to check if a timestamp is on the business hour offset. These properties and methods should be defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class or its parent classes.
