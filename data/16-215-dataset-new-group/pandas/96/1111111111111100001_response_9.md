Looking at the failing test and tracing the input values and types through the buggy function, it appears that the bug is centered around the calculations that involve adjusting the date and time. The issue seems to be related to how the business day increments are being handled.

Strategies for fixing the bug could involve:
1. Double-checking the calculation logic for adjusting the dates and times, especially with respect to business day increments (such as the `skip_bd` adjustments).
2. Reviewing the logic that determines the opening and closing times for business hours and ensuring that it aligns correctly with the specified business hours.
3. Ensuring that the adjustment calculations are dealing with date and time values consistently and accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other class methods remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues with date and time calculations and business day increments, resolving the failing test cases.
