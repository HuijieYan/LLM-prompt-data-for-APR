The buggy function seems to be the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding a holiday". The issue describes a problem in which the `pd.date_range` function does not work as expected when using periods and adding a holiday. The expected behavior is that the date_range should generate a specific number of periods within business hours, but instead, it produces more periods than expected.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of business hours and holidays within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The `apply` method is used to adjust datetimes based on business hours, but it seems that the handling of holidays and adjustment logic is leading to the incorrect number of periods when generating the date range.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic of the `apply` method, especially the adjustment of business days and the remaining business hours. Ensuring that holidays are properly handled and that the adjustment logic correctly aligns with business hours will likely resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            if self.n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to previous business day
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    return other
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd = abs(self.n) // 60 // 24  # Business days
            other += BusinessDay(bd)  # Adjust by business days
            remaining_minutes = abs(self.n) % (60 * 24)  # Remaining business hours
            delta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            if self.n >= 0:
                while delta > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_hours = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if delta >= business_hours:
                        other = next_opening
                        delta -= business_hours
                    else:
                        other += delta
                        delta = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while delta > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_hours = next_opening - other
                    if delta > business_hours:
                        other = next_opening
                        delta -= business_hours
                    else:
                        other += delta
                        delta = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours has been reviewed to ensure that holidays are properly handled and that the adjustment aligns with the business hours. This should address the issue experienced in the GitHub bug report.
