The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue when using periods and adding holidays in `pd.date_range`. The problem is that it produces more periods than expected when adding holidays.

The cause of the bug lies in the `apply` function's logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and holidays. The function needs to properly handle the adjustment when holidays are involved.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `apply` function should be modified to correctly adjust the datetime when holidays are included. The adjustment logic should take holidays into account and accurately calculate the number of business hours between start and end dates.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (existing code for adjusting datetime)

            # Check if the adjusted date falls on a holiday
            while other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # ... (existing code for adjusting business days and hours)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, after adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours, we check if the adjusted date falls on a holiday. If it does, we adjust it to the next opening time. This ensures that the adjusted date correctly accounts for holidays and aligns with the expected behavior in `pd.date_range`.
