After analyzing the failing test cases and the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the logic that adjusts the datetime (`other`) based on the business hours and the business day. The if-else conditions for adjusting the datetime may not cover all edge cases and may not account for all possible scenarios.

The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given `other` datetime based on business hours and the specified `self` object representing business hours. It should correctly adjust the `other` datetime based on the business day and business hours.

Looking at the failing test cases, it seems that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime based on business hours and the business day are not accurately reflected in the return values. This indicates that the logic within the `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustments.

To fix the bug, here are some suggested strategies:
1. Review the logic used for adjusting the `other` datetime based on the business hours and business day, and ensure that it covers all edge cases and scenarios.
2. Validate the calculations of business hours and the adjustment logic to ensure accuracy.
3. Check for any incorrect comparisons, calculations, or conditions that may lead to incorrect adjustments.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ensure that other is a datetime object and reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Perform adjustments by business days first
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version of the `apply` function, adjustments are made based on business days and remaining business hours. The logic has been revised to ensure that the adjustments are accurately reflected in the return values.

This corrected version should now accurately adjust the `other` datetime based on the given business hours.
