The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This method is intended to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime. The error is causing the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test to fail with a `ValueError` indicating that the frequency of the date range does not conform to the passed frequency CBH (CustomBusinessHour).

The GitHub issue reports a similar problem, where applying holidays when using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is causing unexpected results, producing more than the expected number of periods.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method is not correctly adjusting the dates based on the given business hour offset and is unable to handle the addition of holidays when calculating the next business day.

To address this issue, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Identify the section of the code within the `apply` method where the adjustment of the dates is occurring and ensure that it properly handles the business hour offset and holidays.
2. Improve the date adjustment algorithm within the `apply` method to accommodate the impact of holidays and verify that it adjusts the dates correctly according to the business hour offset.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
# Assume needed imports are available in the environment

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...
    
    # The corrected apply method
    @staticmethod
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # similar logic as before...

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            # remaining code...

            if holidays is not None and len(holidays) > 0:
                # Adjust for holidays
                other_date_only = other.date()
                if other_date_only in holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                    while other.weekday() > 4 or other.date() in holidays:
                        other += timedelta(days=1)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            # remaining code...
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction involves adding a new parameter `holidays` to the `apply` method, which handles the adjustment of the dates based on the given holidays. The adjustment checks whether the date falls on a holiday, and if so, it shifts the date appropriately.

This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test passes successfully.
