The `apply` function has several issues, including incorrectly adjusting the business days and business hours. Additionally, if the input `other` is a `pd.Timestamp`, the function attempts to reset the timezone and nanosecond, which may lead to unintended behavior. 

To fix the bug in the `apply` function:
1. Check for incorrect adjustment of `other` and the logic for business days and business hours.
2. Avoid resetting the timezone and nanosecond if `other` is already a `pd.Timestamp`.
3. Update the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
4. Raise an error if the input is not a `pd.Timestamp`.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = other + skip_bd
    
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = pd.Timedelta(seconds=(self._prev_opening_time(other) - other).seconds)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = pd.Timedelta(seconds=(self._next_opening_time(other) - other).seconds)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with pd.Timestamp")
```

This corrected version should address the issues by correctly adjusting the business days and hours and avoiding unnecessary adjustments when `other` is already a `pd.Timestamp`. If the input is not a `pd.Timestamp`, it will raise an error.
