The buggy function is not correctly handling the business hours and the given holidays, resulting in incorrect output for the failing test. The issue seems to be related to how the function is calculating the next business day and how it processes the remaining business hours.

The buggy function incorrectly handles the adjustment to move to the previous business day when the `self.n` value is less than 0. Additionally, the adjustment to move to the next opening time and get the closing time is not properly calculated in some cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the date to the previous business day and handling the remaining business hours needs to be accurately implemented within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Replace the buggy function with the following corrected version
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - self.next_bday
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            other += bhour_remain
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - self.next_bday
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
