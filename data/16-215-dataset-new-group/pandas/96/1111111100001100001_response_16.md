Given the runtime input/output variable values and the structure of the buggy function, it seems that the bug lies in the logic when adjusting the 'other' time based on the business hours and business days. The logic for adjusting 'other' time based on the sign of 'n' (positive/negative) and whether it's a business day seems to be incorrect, causing the returned values to be inconsistent with the expected results.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic for adjusting 'other' time based on business hours and business days, ensuring that the adjustments are made accurately for both positive and negative values of 'n'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if n < 0:
            businesshours = -businesshours
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other, bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour

                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting 'other' time based on the values of 'n' (positive/negative) and whether it's a business day has been modified to ensure accurate adjustments. This should address the buggy behavior and produce the expected results for the failing tests.
