Upon analysis, the potential error in the buggy function is related to the incorrect implementation of business hour timedelta adjustments. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is failing to properly adjust the time for business hours, leading to an invalid frequency error when validating the date range with custom holidays.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting the time for business hours and update it accordingly to ensure that the time adjustments are made correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if not is_on_offset(self, other.time()):
                other = next_bday(self)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not is_on_offset(self, other):
                other = _next_opening_time(self, other)
                other = _get_closing_time(self, other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
