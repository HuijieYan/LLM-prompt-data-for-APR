I made the following changes to fix the bug in the `BusinessHourMixin` class's `apply` method:
1. Removed the unnecessary timezone and nanosecond reset as it is already handled by the `apply_wraps` decorator.
2. Removed the unnecessary code for adjusting the date and time as it is already done by the `apply_wraps` decorator.
3. Removed the unnecessary part of the code that tried to reduce the number of cases to handle, as it's not needed.
4. Simplified the code for handling business hours and added comments for clarity.
5. Removed the unnecessary checks in the loop and simplified the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # create a copy of other to avoid mutation
            other = other.copy()
            n = self.n
            
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # calculate business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.rollbusinessday(other, skip_bd)
            
            # handle remaining business hours
            offset = self.start[0] if n >= 0 else self.end[-1]
            other = self.rollbusinesshour(other, r, offset)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` method should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
