### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect calculation of business days and hours when adjusting the datetime according to the CustomBusinessHour offset. The issue lies in the calculation of business days and business hours when adjusting the input datetime according to the offset. 

In the affected cases, the function does not correctly adjust for business days and remaining business hours. This results in incorrect datetime values when the CustomBusinessHour offset is applied.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, several parts of the code must be corrected:
1. Adjusting the input datetime based on the offset's start and end times.
2. Calculating the number of business days and remaining business hours to correctly adjust the datetime.
3. Performing the necessary adjustments when the CustomBusinessHour offset is positive or negative.

The corrected version should ensure that the adjusted datetime adheres to the CustomBusinessHour offset while taking into account business days and remaining business hours.

### Corrected Code

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Adjusting the input datetime based on the offset's start and end times
        if n >= 0:
