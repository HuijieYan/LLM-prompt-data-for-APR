The bug in the function is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. In each test case, the function is passed a `Timestamp` object and a `CustomBusinessHour` object. The failing test appears to be related to calculating the next business hour time.

The current implementation of the `apply` function fails to correctly calculate the next business hour time due to incorrect logic. The bug seems to be in the logic for adjusting the time to reduce the number of cases to handle, and also in the calculation of the total business hours by seconds in one business day.

The suggested strategy for fixing this bug is to carefully review and rewrite the logic for adjusting the input time and calculating the total business hours. Make sure that the logic for adjusting the time and the calculation of total business hours by seconds are correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n
        start_date = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.start[0].hour,
            self.start[0].minute,
            self.start[0].second,
            self.start[0].microsecond,
        )

        current_date = datetime(
        other.year,
        other.month,
        other.day,
        other.hour,
        other.minute,
        other.second,
        other.microsecond,
        )

        if n > 0:  # Move to next business hour if n is positive
            diff = start_date - current_date
            if diff.total_seconds() > 0:
                return start_date
            else:
                next_hour = start_date.replace(hour=start_date.hour+1)  # Move to next hour
                return next_hour
        else: # Move to previous business hour if n is negative
            if current_date.hour < self.start[0].hour:
                prev_hour = start_date.replace(hour=start_date.hour-1)  # Move to previous hour
                return prev_hour
            else:
                return start_date

```

With the corrected `apply` function, it should now pass the failing test.
