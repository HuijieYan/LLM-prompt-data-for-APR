Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies with the CustomBusinessHour offset not being applied correctly when using `pd.date_range()`, leading to a ValueError in the frequency validation. The error message specifically mentions that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency CustomBusinessHour (CBH).

The bug originates from the implementation of the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The `apply` function is not handling the logic properly for adjusting the business hours, which results in an incorrect frequency being inferred and subsequently failing the frequency validation.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic within the `apply` function to ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are correctly applied to the input datetime. Additionally, the function should return the adjusted datetime to conform to the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function for the `CustomBusinessHour` class:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # ... (existing code for adjustment logic)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.nearest_offset(other) + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            next_opening_time = self.rollforward(other)
            bhour = next_opening_time - other
            if bhour < bhour_remain:
                other = next_opening_time
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function, the provided failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without raising a ValueError.
