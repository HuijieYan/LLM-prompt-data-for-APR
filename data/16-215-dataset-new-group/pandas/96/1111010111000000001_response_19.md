The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has a few issues:
1. It is not handling the custom holidays correctly, resulting in incorrect output.
2. It is not handling the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly.

The bug is caused by not properly adjusting the business days and business hours, resulting in incorrect datetime adjustments, especially when custom holidays are involved.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of business days and business hours needs to be handled correctly, especially when handling custom holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            def is_business_time(dt):
                return dt.time() in self.start or dt.time() in self.end

            def next_business_day(dt):
                if n < 0:
                    return dt + timedelta(days=-1)
                return self._next_opening_time(dt)

            business_day = timedelta(days=1)
            while n != 0:
                other = next_business_day(other)
                if is_business_time(other):
                    n += 1 if n < 0 else -1
                if n == 0 or self._is_on_offset(other):
                    break
                
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly, taking into account the custom holidays. It should pass the failing test provided.
