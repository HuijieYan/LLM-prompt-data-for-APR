To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to identify the potential error locations and understand the cause of the bug.

Potential error locations in the `apply` function:
1. Incorrect handling of adjustments for negative n.
2. Incorrect calculation for business hours by seconds.
3. Incorrect adjustment for business days.
4. Incorrect calculation for remaining business hours.
5. Incorrect handling of business time intervals.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is not properly handling the application of custom business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments for negative n, incorrect calculations for business hours, incorrect handling of business days, and incorrect calculations for remaining business hours. This leads to the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the handling of adjustments for negative n.
2. Correct the calculation for business hours by seconds.
3. Correct the adjustment for business days.
4. Correct the calculation for remaining business hours.
5. Correct the handling of business time intervals.

Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            (en - st).total_seconds() for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other) + BusinessDay(n=bd)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)    

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                # Business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                # Business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass.
