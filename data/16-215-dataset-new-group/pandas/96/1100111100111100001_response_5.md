The buggy function appears to be a part of the implementation of custom business hours within the Pandas library, which is designed to replace business days with custom hours. The main issue causing the failing test is the improper handling of the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

The first step to fixing the bug is to identify that the failing tests are related to the creation of a date range during which the CustomBusinessHour should be applied. The failing tests indicate that the current implementation of the `apply` function is not correctly aligning the timestamps to the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `apply` function to correctly align the timestamps to the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency and ensure that the `apply` function works as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self.is_on_offset(other):  # Changing to is_on_offset to get correct behavior
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying this fix, the `apply` function now correctly aligns timestamps to the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency, which should resolve the failing test.
