The bug in the given function seems to be causing a `ValueError` when calling the `_validate_frequency` method with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The bug may stem from incorrect date and time calculations within the function. 

The buggy function is trying to manipulate the `other` datetime to adjust it to a custom business hour frequency, but it seems to be encountering issues in cases where the adjusted time crosses the boundaries set by the custom business hour. The error seems to be with mismatched inferred frequency and passed frequency. The bug is causing the validation of the frequency to fail.

It would be advisable to revise how the adjustments and calculations are handled, particularly in the sections that modify the `other` datetime based on the custom business hour rules. A thorough review of the logic for adjusting the business hours and handling edge cases is necessary to fix the bug. 

Here's a corrected implementation of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to the beginning of the custom business hour
        other = shift_month(other, 0)

        # Adjust other to the next opening time based on the custom business hour
        if n >= 0:
            other = roll_yearday(other, 1)
        else:
            other = roll_yearday(other, 0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected function with a variety of inputs to ensure that it handles edge cases and boundary conditions correctly. Additionally, since the function interacts with a custom business hour, it would be prudent to validate the adjustments with a range of timestamps within the business hour.
