The bug is caused by incorrect handling of custom business hours and holidays in the `apply` function. The issue is evident in the failure of the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test. The failing test generates an unexpected result when trying to get a date range with custom business hours and holidays.

Upon investigation of the failing test and runtime input/output variable values, it's clear that the bug occurs when computing the `other` variable in the `apply` function. The issue is related to the calculation of holidays and how it impacts the frequency of custom business hours.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours needs to be reviewed and updated to correctly incorporate the effect of holidays. Additionally, the conditional statements related to adjusting the business hours and days should be refined to ensure the correct behavior in different scenarios.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# ... (import statements and other functions remain unchanged)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions in the class remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            # Check if the day is a holiday
            while other in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)

            # Adjust business days and hours
            if n > 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while n >= 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                while n < 0:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The corrected version now includes logic to handle the effect of holidays when adjusting the business days and hours. By iteratively checking and adjusting based on holidays and business hours, the corrected version should ensure the expected behavior.

This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass.
