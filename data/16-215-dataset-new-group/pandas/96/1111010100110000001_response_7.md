The bug seems to be in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The related error message suggests that there is an issue with validation of a frequency that is not conformant with the passed frequency.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function are:
1. Handling of `other` when `n` is negative
2. Adjustment of `other` based on business days and business hours

The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on whether `n` is positive or negative. It seems that the adjustment logic is not properly handling negative values of `n` and may be resulting in a frequency issue with the passed values.

To fix the bug, I would suggest reviewing and updating the logic for handling negative values of `n` to ensure that the adjustment of `other` is done correctly in those cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Handle edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # Business days adjustment
        if n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        else:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

The corrected version of the `apply` function has been updated to ensure proper adjustment of the `other` datetime based on whether `n` is positive or negative. This should address the frequency issue reported in the failing test.
