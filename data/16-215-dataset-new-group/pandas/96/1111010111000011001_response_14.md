To address the issue we need to follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the 'pandas' library and its relationship with class attributes, test code, and the expected input/output values.
2. Identify potential error locations in the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, and the expected input/output variable values.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Provide a corrected version of the buggy function to satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output values.

Based on the failing test function provided, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, it appears that the datetime adjustments made within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class are failing to correctly calculate the business hours. The failing test case illustrates the problem by indicating the incorrect datetime values generated by the `apply` function.

The root cause of the bug is primarily in how the business hours and adjustments are calculated and applied within the `apply` function. It seems that the adjustments for different cases are not being handled properly due to incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to thoroughly review the logic in the `apply` function and make necessary adjustments to ensure the correct calculations for business hours and adjustments to the datetime.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                while other.time() not in self.start:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                while other.time() not in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                n += 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction focuses on the adjustment of the `other` datetime based on positive or negative business hours. The corrected version iterates through the adjustments incrementing or decrementing the `other` datetime by 1 hour at a time until the required number of business hours are added or subtracted, taking into account the start time of the business hours.

This corrected version is expected to satisfy the failing test cases and the expected input/output variable values.
