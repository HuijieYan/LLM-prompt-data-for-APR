To fix the bug in the `apply` function provided, we need to address several potential issues. The current function attempts to apply business hours and adjust the datetime object according to the specified custom business hours. However, the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` fails, indicating that the function does not handle holidays correctly.

The `apply` function identifies holidays using the `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` condition, but it fails to account for holidays when adjusting the datetime to the next opening time. This results in the incorrect output when holidays are added to the date range with custom business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays, adjusting the datetime according to the custom business hours while considering the presence of holidays.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta


@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Identify holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly
        if self._is_on_offset(other) and not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            business_day = BusinessDay(n=1)
            other = other + business_day

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expected to pass, and the function should handle holidays correctly when adjusting the datetime according to the custom business hours.
