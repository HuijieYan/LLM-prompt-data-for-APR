The bug originates from the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method fails to correctly convert the offset datetime and is not returning the expected datetime output. The resulting datetime does not conform to the specified custom business hour frequency. This causes the error due to an incorrect frequency being passed, which is inconsistent with the expected inferred frequency.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the custom business hour frequency. The code incorrectly handles the adjustments and business hours calculations, leading to an erroneous offset time, which then fails the frequency validation.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime considering the business hours and offsets should be revisited. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime.replace(microsecond=other.microsecond)
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjustment by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function now takes into account the business hours and offsets, adjusts the datetime accordingly, and should pass the failing test.
