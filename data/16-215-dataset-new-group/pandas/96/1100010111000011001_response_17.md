The given buggy function is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours. However, it currently contains several issues, causing it to fail the provided test. The issues include incorrect adjustments, the incorrect assumption of the need for adjustments in some scenarios, and potential logic errors.

One of the major problems is that the adjustments in the `apply` function are not properly handling the custom business hour logic. The `apply` function relies on several other sub-functions like `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_get_business_hours_by_sec` which appear to be working correctly on their own. The issue seems to be in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.

To fix the buggy function:
1. Update the adjustment logic to correctly handle business hours and business days.
2. Ensure that business day objects, such as `skip_bd`, are used appropriately.
3. Correct any assumptions about the behavior of the `other` datetime object.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for business days
        result = other
        if self.n != 0:
            business_days = self.n // (len(self.start) // 2)
            result += pd.tseries.offsets.BDay(self.n - 2*business_days)
        
        # Adjust for business hours within the day
        time_is_start = result.time() in self.start
        time_is_end = result.time() in self.end
        if time_is_start or not time_is_end:
            h, m, s = self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute, self.start[0].second
            result = result.replace(hour=h, minute=m, second=s)
        else:
            h, m, s = self.end[-1].hour, self.end[-1].minute, self.end[-1].second
            result = result.replace(hour=h, minute=m, second=s)
        
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
