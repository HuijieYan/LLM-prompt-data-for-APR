In the provided code, the `apply` function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. However, it seems that the implementation may not be correct, given the error message from the failing test.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of applying a custom business hour frequency on a date range. The specific error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency validation, where the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The bug in the `apply` function may be causing the CustomBusinessHour frequency to be improperly applied, leading to the frequency validation failure.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour offset is properly calculated and applied to the given datetime object.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n == 0:
            return other

        start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
        business_hours = (self.end.hour - self.start.hour) * 60 + (self.end.minute - self.start.minute)

        # Adjust the start time based on the custom business hour
        while n > 0:
            start_time += timedelta(minutes=business_hours)
            if other >= start_time:
                start_time = datetime(start_time.year, start_time.month, start_time.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
                continue
            n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            start_time -= timedelta(minutes=business_hours)
            if other <= start_time:
                start_time = datetime(start_time.year, start_time.month, start_time.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
                continue
            n += 1

        return start_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the custom business hour offset is properly calculated and applied to the given datetime object based on the value of `n`. This should resolve the frequency validation issue and ensure that the custom business hour frequency is correctly applied as expected.
