The buggy function `apply` is causing an issue with the `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. This bug is reported in GitHub issue #19258.

The bug is likely occurring due to the calculation and adjustment of dates within the `apply` function, leading to unexpected results when used with the `date_range` function and holiday offsets.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the adjustment of dates within the `apply` function is correctly aligning with the business hours and holidays.

Below is a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the reported bug:
```python
# other imports
import numpy as np

# original imports
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # handle holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                return other
            
            # perform business hour calculation
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # handle business days
            if np.is_busday(other.date()):
                while n < 0 and not np.is_busday(other.date() - timedelta(days=1)):
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    
                while n > 0 and not np.is_busday(other.date() + timedelta(days=1)):
                    other = other + timedelta(days=1)
            
            # calculate skip business days
            business_days = np.busday_count(other.date(), other.date() + np.timedelta64(n, 'D'))
            other = np.busday_offset(other, business_days, roll='forward')
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments for holidays and business days are added to ensure that the `apply` function works correctly with periods and holidays when used with the `date_range` function.
