The issue with the given function seems to be with the logic to calculate the adjusted time based on business hours, especially when the input datetime is at the start or end of the business hours. The current logic does not handle these edge cases properly, resulting in incorrect adjusted time. 

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the logic within the if-else blocks for adjusting the business hours. Specifically, the if-else blocks that handle the cases where `n >= 0` and `n < 0` need to be re-evaluated for handling the edge cases effectively.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This modified function includes a reworked logic for adjusting the business hours with proper handling of the edge cases.

After applying these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
