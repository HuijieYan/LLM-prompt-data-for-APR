The buggy function causes the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail because it does not handle the case where a holiday falls within the specified periods in `pd.date_range`. This results in an incorrect return value that does not match the expected result.

The specific issue mentioned on GitHub also reflects the same problem, where the user is observing unexpected behavior when adding holidays to `pd.date_range` while specifying periods. This indicates that the bug affects the functionality of adding holidays to the date range when using periods.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function for the BusinessHourMixin class needs to be modified to properly handle the case where holidays are added to the periods in `pd.date_range`.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ignore timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to the nearest opening time
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get the total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust remaining hours within each business day
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should now handle the case when adding holidays to periods in `pd.date_range`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
