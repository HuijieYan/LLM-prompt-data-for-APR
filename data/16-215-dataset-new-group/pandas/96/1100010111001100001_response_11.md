The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours, as well as the handling of time intervals. The function is designed to adjust a datetime object based on a specific set of business hours, but it fails to do so correctly in some cases.

It appears that the bug is causing incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object, leading to incorrect results. This could be due to incorrect calculations of business days, remaining business hours, and handling of time intervals.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and ensure that the calculation and adjustment process is correct for positive and negative offsets.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version above addresses several potential issues with the logic of the original function, including adjustments to the datetime object, handling of business days, and calculations for remaining business hours. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works correctly with the provided failing test.
