The buggy function `apply` is supposed to apply a specified business hour offset to a given datetime. However, it fails to properly adjust the date and time according to the provided business hour offset, as evidenced by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The failing test is expected to produce a `DatetimeIndex` based on custom business hours, with the specified start time and holidays. The test is expected to provide 4 datetime periods, but it encounters a `ValueError` instead.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function does not properly adjust the date and time according to the specified business hour offset, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustments of the date and time based on the specified business hour offset. This can be achieved by carefully inspecting the logic around the adjustments and making sure it aligns with the intended behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            result = other

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                result = skip_bd.apply(result)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    result = self._next_opening_time(result)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(result)) - result
                    result += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(result)
                    bhour = next_open - result
                    result += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        result = self._get_closing_time(next_open - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of `apply`, the failing test should pass without encountering any `ValueError`.
