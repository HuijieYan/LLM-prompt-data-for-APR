The bug in the `apply` function is likely causing the issue reported on GitHub, where adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour frequency leads to an unexpected number of periods in the resulting date range.

After analyzing the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug causes the date range to be incorrectly calculated when holidays are included in the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This leads to extra periods in the resulting date range.

The `apply` function modifies the input datetime based on the conditions and subsequently calculates the business hours and adjusts the date accordingly. However, it seems to miss the proper handling of holidays, leading to inaccurate adjustments in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly accounts for the holidays in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from pandas.core.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# ...

# Corrected version of the apply() function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # The existing code to reset timezone and nanosecond

        # Consider the holiday in the CustomBusinessHour frequency
        adjusted_other = self.rollforward(other)  # Adjust for holidays
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if adjusted_other not in self or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)
        else:
            if adjusted_other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                adjusted_other = adjusted_other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        # The rest of the code for calculating business hours and adjustments can remain the same

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version of the `apply` function incorporates adjustments to account for holidays in the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This modification aims to address the root cause of the bug and should result in the corrected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when working with CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays.
