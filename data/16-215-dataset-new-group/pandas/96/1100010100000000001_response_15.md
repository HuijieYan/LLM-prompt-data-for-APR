### Analysis
The buggy function had several issues:
1. Incorrect use of the `time` property of the `datetime` object.
2. Incorrect comparisons of time intervals.
3. Incorrect handling of negative business days.
4. Inconsistent use of the `business_days` variable.
5. Neglecting the UTC offset while creating the new `datetime` object.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correctly compare the time intervals for checking if `other` falls within the business hour.
2. Properly handle the case of negative business days.
3. Correctly set the UTC offset in the new `datetime` object to avoid losing timezone information.
4. Correctly handle the remaining business hours in both positive and negative cases.

The corrected version addresses these issues and provides a more accurate business hour adjustment functionality.
