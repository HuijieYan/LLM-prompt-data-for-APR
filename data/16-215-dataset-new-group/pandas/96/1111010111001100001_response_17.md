The bug in the provided function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of adjustment and computation with datetime objects, particularly when defining business hours and adjusting the datetime with business days or business hours.

One potential issue is that the function doesn't account for the case where `n` is 0, which affects the calculation of business days and hours to adjust. Additionally, it seems that there might be a misinterpretation of the expected behavior for the adjustment process with business days and hours.

To fix the bug, you can consider the following strategy:
- Modify the logic for adjusting the datetime in cases where `n` is non-positive or zero to correctly account for business days and remaining business hours.
- Check the edge cases where the datetime falls within the business hours and adjust accordingly.
- Verify the conditions for incrementing or decrementing the `businessdays` variable based on the value of `n`.
- Validate the adjustments made within the `while` loops against the expected behavior for the adjustment process.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for edge cases
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n != 0:
            # Compute business days to adjust
            businessdays, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                businessdays, r = -businessdays, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if businessdays != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=businessdays)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    # Adjust for positive n
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Adjust for negative n
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    else:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these modifications, the corrected version of the `apply` function should pass the failing test provided.
