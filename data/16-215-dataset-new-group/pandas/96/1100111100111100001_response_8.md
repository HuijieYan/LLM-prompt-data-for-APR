The buggy function is failing the tests because the logic for calculating the adjusted datetime is incorrect. The function is supposed to adjust the input datetime based on business hours and days, but it is not doing so correctly.

A potential error location is identified in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the specified business hours and days. The adjustments involve calculations related to the input datetime, the business hours, and the remaining time to adjust.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the datetime is not accurately accounting for business days and hours, resulting in incorrect output and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to accurately account for business days, business hours, and the remaining time to adjust.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remaining_time = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                days_to_jump, remaining_time = divmod(remaining_time.total_seconds() / 60, business_hours // 60)
                if days_to_jump:
                    other += self.next_bday * days_to_jump
                if remaining_time:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_time)
                n -= 1
            else:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                while n != 0:
                    previous_closing = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                    remaining_time = other - previous_closing
                    remaining_hours = abs(n * 60)
                    if remaining_time.total_seconds() / 60 < remaining_hours:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        other = previous_closing + timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                        n -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should now accurately adjust the input datetime based on the specified business hours and days without causing the failing tests.
