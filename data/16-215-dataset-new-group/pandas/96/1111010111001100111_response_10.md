Based on the information provided, the buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the pandas `offsets.py` file is failing to work correctly with periods and holidays when used with the `pd.date_range` function. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is an example of such behavior. The main cause seems to be the improper handling of the holidays within the `apply` function.

The failing test case provides various input parameter values and their types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. This includes the Timestamp `other`, `self.n`, `self.end`, `self.start`, `self.holidays`, `self.next_bday`, and others. 

To fix this bug, the `apply` function needs to be updated to properly handle holidays and ensure that the calculations for adjusting business days and hours are performed correctly. We need to ensure that the custom business hour is properly taken into account when determining the result of applying the offset.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that should address the bug and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (the existing code)
        if _to_dt64(other) in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # ... (the existing code for adjusting days and hours)
        
        return as_datetime(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this updated version, we first check if the current date is a holiday, and then adjust it accordingly to the next opening time. We also ensure to return the result as a `datetime` object.

By updating the `apply` function as per the provided corrected version, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
