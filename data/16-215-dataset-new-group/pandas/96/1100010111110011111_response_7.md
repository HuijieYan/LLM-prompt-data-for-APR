The problem with the buggy function `apply` seems to be related to the handling of business hours with the given holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a `DatetimeIndex` with periods based on custom business hours with holidays. However, the buggy function is not properly adjusting for holidays, leading to unexpected behavior in the test.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of business hours for holidays in the `apply` function. The date_range generation seems to be producing more periods than expected, which is due to the buggy behavior in the application of custom business hours with holidays.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should properly handle holidays when adjusting the given business hours. It should accurately account for the holidays and adjust the business hours accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)
        
        # adjust other to account for holidays
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
            while other.date() in self.holidays:
                if self.n >= 0:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)

        # (existing code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version now accounts for holidays when adjusting business hours, ensuring that the periods are correctly calculated even when holidays are involved.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the `date_range` function works as expected with custom business hours and holidays.
