The buggy function contains several potential error locations, including:

1. The datetime attribute, nanosecond, is being treated as a property of the datetime class in the if statement, `if isinstance(other, datetime)` before actually checking if the attribute exists.
2. The indexing of the opening and closing times using `self.start` and `self.end` inside the `sum()` function may cause out-of-bounds errors.
3. The check for business hours not equal to zero in the while loop may lead to an infinite loop due to floating-point errors.
4. No return type is specified for the function, so it may not return the expected type or raise an error if there is an issue.
5. The indentation of the raise statement is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Check if the nanosecond attribute exists before trying to retrieve its value.
2. Ensure the indexing of the opening and closing times does not go out of bounds.
3. Compare the timedelta to zero using a tolerance value instead of direct comparison.
4. Specify the return type of the function as datetime.
5. Correct the indentation of the raise statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
