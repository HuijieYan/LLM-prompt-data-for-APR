The bug in the `apply` function lies in the logic for adjusting the timestamp with respect to business hours and holidays. The `BusinessHourMixin` class, and subsequently the `apply` function, does not handle the adjustments properly when a holiday is included. This results in incorrect `date_range` generation in cases where the `periods` parameter is used.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustments considering holidays and the number of periods.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            0,  # reset seconds to 0
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for holidays
            while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Determine the number of business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            # Loop to adjust business days
            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_day(other, self.weekmask, self.holidays)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_day(other, self.weekmask, self.holidays)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Loop to adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the updated `apply` function, the adjustments for holidays and the number of periods will be handled correctly, ensuring that the `date_range` function works as expected, especially when holidays are included.

This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and make the tests pass.
