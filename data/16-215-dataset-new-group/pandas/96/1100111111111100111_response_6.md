The buggy function is causing unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The reported issue is related to the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays and periods, resulting in more than the expected number of periods. 

The bug in the `apply` function is related to the handling of business hours, which leads to incorrect adjustments and unexpected behavior. This is further evidenced by the failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and the corresponding error message indicating a ValueError during frequency validation.

Based on the analysis of the runtime input/output values and the failing test, it's apparent that the bug arises from the improper handling of business days and business hours within the `apply` function, leading to unexpected behavior when combining business hours with datetime.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to review and revise the logic for adjusting business hours and days. The logic needs to be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly without causing unexpected behavior that leads to the generation of more than the expected number of periods.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        if n >= 0:
            # handle positive n
            end_time = other.time()
            if end_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # handle negative n
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            # process positive n
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            # process negative n
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the bug by revising the logic for adjusting business hours and days, ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly without causing unexpected behavior. With this correction, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
