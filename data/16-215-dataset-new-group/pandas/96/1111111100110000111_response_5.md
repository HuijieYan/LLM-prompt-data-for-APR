The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is using various custom functionality from other methods within the same class and other global functions. It also relies on several attributes and calculations specific to business hours.

The error message from the failing test shows that the issue is related to `pd.date_range`, `periods`, and `holidays`. The error is occurring due to an incorrect calculation of business hours with holidays when using `pd.date_range` with frequency as `CustomBusinessHour`.

The GitHub issue explains that `pd.date_range` fails when combined with periods and adding holidays. The output includes more than the expected number of periods when holidays are added.

The cause of the bug is in the implementation of the `apply` function, which is not handling holidays and business hours correctly. This leads to incorrect business hour adjustments when calculating the range of dates using `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to properly account for holidays when adjusting business hours. Additionally, the logic for handling business days, holidays, and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other methods in the class)

    # this is the fixed function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust for holidays
            if holidays and other in holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            remaining_hours = self._get_remaining_business_hours(other, self.n)
            
            return self._adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, remaining_hours)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _get_remaining_business_hours(self, dt, n):
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        return divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60) if n >= 0 else (-divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)[0], -divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)[1])

    def _adjust_for_remaining_hours(self, dt, remaining_hours):
        bd, r = remaining_hours
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            dt += self._adjust_for_business_days(bd)
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        dt += self._adjust_for_business_hours(r)

        return dt
    
    def _adjust_for_business_days(self, bd):
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        return skip_bd
    
    def _adjust_for_business_hours(self, r):
        if r >= 0:
            return self._adjust_for_positive_business_hours(r)
        else:
            return self._adjust_for_negative_business_hours(r)

    def _adjust_for_positive_business_hours(self, r):
        while r != timedelta(0):
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time()
            if opening_time - dt >= r:
                dt += r
                r = timedelta(0)
            else:
                r -= opening_time - dt
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt + opening_time)
        return dt

    def _adjust_for_negative_business_hours(self, r):
        while r != timedelta(0):
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time()
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            if r > closing_time - dt or (r == closing_time - dt and dt.nanosecond != 0):
                dt += r
                r = timedelta(0)
            else:
                r -= closing_time - dt
                dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt + closing_time - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        return dt
```

In this corrected version, the `apply` function takes an additional parameter `holidays`, which allows for proper adjustment of business hours when holidays are present. The logic for handling business days and remaining business hours has been refactored to provide accurate adjustments.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test mentioned in the error message.
