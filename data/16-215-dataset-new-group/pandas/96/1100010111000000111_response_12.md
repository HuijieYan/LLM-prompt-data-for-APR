The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function in the `offsets.py` file is not correctly adjusting business hours when holidays are included, which leads to an incorrect number of periods in the date range.

The strategy for fixing this bug involves making adjustments to the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and calculate periods.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        total_minutes = abs(n * 60)
        bd, r = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            existing_holidays = [h.date() for h in self.holidays]
            new_holidays = existing_holidays + [other.date()]
            holiday_businessdays = len(pd.date_range(min(new_holidays), max(new_holidays), freq=CustomBusinessDay(n=1, holidays=new_holidays))) - 1
            bd += holiday_businessdays

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        adjust_to_next = self._next_opening_time if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = adjust_to_next(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = adjust_to_next(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected `apply` function, the adjustments are made to correctly handle holidays and calculate periods. The function now adjusts business days and business hours based on holidays and the direction of the offset. This corrected version will address the issue described in the GitHub report.
