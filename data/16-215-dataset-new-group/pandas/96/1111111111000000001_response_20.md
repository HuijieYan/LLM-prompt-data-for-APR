The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is designed to apply custom business hour logic to a datetime object. The function utilizes several helper methods from the same class to adjust the datetime based on business hour intervals.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours is complex, and there are multiple conditions and loops that can lead to potential errors.
2. The calculations for adjusting the datetime by business days and remaining business hours need to be carefully evaluated for precision and correctness.
3. The comparison and adjustment of remaining business hours within the while loops might not be accurate.

The failing test creates a custom business hour frequency and generates a date range based on this custom business hour frequency. The test then compares the resulting date range with an expected date range. The failure indicates that the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the datetimes based on the custom business hour frequency.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully evaluate and simplify the logic within the `apply` function. Additionally, each step of adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure precision and correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            if self.n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or other < next_opening:
                    return next_opening
                else:
                    return self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    return self._get_closing_time(prev_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))
                else:
                    return self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime is simplified to ensure that the datetime is correctly adjusted based on the custom business hour frequency. This version should pass the failing test.
