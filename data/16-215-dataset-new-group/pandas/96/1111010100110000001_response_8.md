The `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is throwing a `ValueError` in the failing test, indicating that the frequency inferred from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, CBH. This implies that there is an issue with the logic of the `apply` method when handling the frequency, resulting in the incorrect inferred frequency value.

Upon analyzing the `apply` method, we can identify a few potential error locations:
1. The logic for adjusting the given datetime `other` may not be correctly handling the business hours and the adjustment by business days.
2. The calculation of the `inferred` value and the validation logic based on the inferred value might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic for the given datetime is correctly handling business hours and days. Additionally, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency value is correctly calculated based on the input datetime values and the specified frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            #adjust the given datetime to the next opening time if it falls outside the business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while other.time() not in self.start:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                while other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = other - timedelta(hours=1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have simplified the logic to adjust the given datetime `other` based on the business hours. This should address the issue of the `ValueError` being raised due to the incorrect inferred frequency.

Please note that this fix addresses the adjustment logic for the datetime within the `apply` method based on the provided error message. If there are additional issues related to frequency inference, further analysis of those specific cases would be necessary.
