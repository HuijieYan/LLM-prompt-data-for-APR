The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the failing tests in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function. The issue reported on GitHub also relates to how `date_range` behaves when using periods and adding holidays with `CustomBusinessHour`.

The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the `other` timestamp value to handle business hours and holidays. In some cases, it incorrectly calculates the adjusted timestamp, leading to unexpected periods in the result.

The main issue seems to be related to how the function handles business hours, holidays, and the adjustment of the `other` timestamp. In particular, the logic for adjusting the timestamp seems to be causing the unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` timestamp based on business days, remaining business hours, and the presence of holidays needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions...
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0], weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            
            adjusted_datetime = other
        
            while adjusted_datetime.time() not in self.start and adjusted_datetime.time() not in self.end:
                adjusted_datetime = business_hour.rollforward(adjusted_datetime)
                
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the `other` timestamp has been simplified. The code now uses the `rollforward` method of `CustomBusinessHour` to adjust the `other` timestamp based on business hours and holidays. This corrected logic should address the issues reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
