The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `pd.date_range` function behaves unexpectedly when using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` with the `periods` parameter and adding holidays. The user has observed that adding holidays causes the function to produce more than the specified number of periods.

Upon analyzing the buggy function provided in the code, it seems that there is an issue with the logic for adjusting business hours when holidays are involved. The function is not handling the adjustment correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the adjustments and logic for handling holidays need to be revised to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated, accounting for the specified holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        business_start = self.start[0]
        business_end = self.end[-1]
        n = self.n
        
        if n > 0:
            holiday_adjusted = other
            while n > 0:
                if holiday_adjusted in self:
                    holiday_adjusted += timedelta(hours=1)
                else:
                    n -= 1
                    if n > 0:
                        prev_start = holiday_adjusted
                        while prev_start not in self:
                            prev_start -= timedelta(hours=1)
                        holiday_adjusted = prev_start + timedelta(hours=1)

            while holiday_adjusted < business_start:
                holiday_adjusted += timedelta(hours=1)

            while holiday_adjusted.time() not in self.start or holiday_adjusted in self.holidays:
                holiday_adjusted += timedelta(hours=1)

            return holiday_adjusted

        if n < 0:
            holiday_adjusted = other
            while n < 0:
                if holiday_adjusted in self:
                    holiday_adjusted -= timedelta(hours=1)
                else:
                    n += 1
                    if n < 0:
                        next_start = holiday_adjusted
                        while next_start not in self:
                            next_start += timedelta(hours=1)
                        holiday_adjusted = (next_start - timedelta(hours=1))

            while holiday_adjusted > business_end:
                holiday_adjusted -= timedelta(hours=1)

            while holiday_adjusted.time() not in self.end or holiday_adjusted in self.holidays:
                holiday_adjusted -= timedelta(hours=1)

            return holiday_adjusted

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The modified logic ensures that the adjustment for holidays correctly aligns with the specified number of periods, accounting for positive and negative values of `self.n`.

With the corrected function, the `apply` function should now return the expected datetime values based on the input parameters, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
