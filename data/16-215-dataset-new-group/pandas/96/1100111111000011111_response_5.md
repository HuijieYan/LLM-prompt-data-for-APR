The buggy function seems to be related to the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when a custom business hour with holidays is used. The function is causing unexpected periods to be added when holidays are included in the input.

The potential errors in the buggy function are related to the calculations and adjustments made to the `other` datetime variable based on the business hours and holidays.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime variable to match the business hours and holidays. The adjustment logic seems to be faulty, leading to unexpected periods being added.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime variable based on the business hours and holidays needs to be reviewed and possibly re-implemented. The adjustments should ensure that the expected number of periods is added, taking into account the custom business hour and the specified holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ...

    # this is the corrected version of the previous buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            closing_times = []
            opening_times = []
            for _ in range(abs(r // 60) + 1):
                closing_times.append(self._get_closing_time(other))
                opening_times.append(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            if n >= 0:
                for i in range(len(closing_times) - 1):
                    bhour = closing_times[i] - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = opening_times[i]
                other += bhour_remain
            else:
                for i in range(len(opening_times) - 1, -1, -1):
                    bhour = opening_times[i] - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = closing_times[i]
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function should handle the adjustments to the `other` datetime variable more consistently and accurately, ensuring that the correct number of periods is added when using a custom business hour with holidays.

Testing the corrected function against the failing test should confirm that the bug has been resolved.
