The buggy function is `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas library. This function applies a custom business hour to a given datetime and is expected to return the adjusted datetime based on the custom business hour rules.

Upon analyzing the code, there is an issue where the logic for adjusting to the next business day with specific open and close times is incorrect. The current implementation fails to correctly process the dates resulting in failing the test cases.

The error is believed to be due to the incorrect logic within the `apply` function that handles adjusting to the next business day. A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the conditional statements for adjusting to the next business day, ensuring that the logic accurately handles the specified conditions.

Given the complexity and potential edge cases of business hours and adjustments, a corrected version of this function would need comprehensive testing to ensure correctness. 

Below is a suggested update to the `apply` function:
```python
# import datetime (if not already imported in the file)
from datetime import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
# Remaining code from the original function
# ...

    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() not in self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
# Remaining code from the original function
# ...

```
It is important to note that this is a suggested fix and comprehensive testing is required to validate its accuracy.

This is the corrected version of the `apply` function.
