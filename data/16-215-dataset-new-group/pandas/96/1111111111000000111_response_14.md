The potential error locations in the buggy function can be identified as the following:
1. The use of different date and time components when adjusting the `other` datetime object to reduce the number of cases to handle.
2. Incorrect handling of business days in the `skip_bd` block.
3. Inaccurate adjustments of the remaining business hours in both the `while` loops when computing the adjusted datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the datetime `other` based on business hours and days, leading to the incorrect output in the failing test case. This bug results in unexpected behavior when adding holidays.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve ensuring accurate adjustment of the `other` datetime by considering all components, handling business days correctly, and correctly adjusting the remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug should now be fixed, and the failing test case should pass successfully.
