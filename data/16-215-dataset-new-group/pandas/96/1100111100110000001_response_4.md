The bug in the provided function is likely due to a logical error in the conditional statements and the use of methods of the class `BusinessHourMixin` within the function. The error message indicates a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method, which suggests that the frequency inferred does not conform to the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be revised to correctly handle the adjustment of business days and business hours. Additionally, we need to fix the usage of methods specific to the `BusinessHourMixin` class and ensure that the business hour offsets are handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Identify business day and business hour offsets
        n = self.n
        start = self._get_real_start()
        end = self._get_real_end()
        
        # Ensure that other is in datetime format without timezone
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
        
        # Adjust the datetime based on the business day and hour offsets
        if n >= 0:
            # If the time matches the end of the business interval or not on the offset, move to the next opening time
            if other.time() in end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # If the time matches the start of the business interval, move to the previous day
            if other.time() in start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            # If not on the offset, move to the next opening time and then to the closing time
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Adjust based on the total business hours for the day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(start, end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            # Calculate the business day offset and adjust the datetime accordingly
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday().apply(other) + skip_bd
        
        # Finish adjusting the remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            # If there are remaining business hours, adjust the datetime accordingly
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._prev_opening_time(other)
                ) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            # If there are remaining business hours, adjust the datetime accordingly
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and other.nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected function, the logic for adjusting business days and business hours is properly handled. The conditionals are also updated to use the corrected methods and attributes of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
