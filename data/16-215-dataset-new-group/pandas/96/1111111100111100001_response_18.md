Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the bug is related to the business hour adjustment logic. The function is not correctly adjusting the business hours according to the given input parameters. The expected behavior is to adjust the business hours based on the specified conditions, but the current implementation is not producing the expected results.

The buggy function `apply` adjusts the input `datetime` based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function includes an extensive routine for adjusting the business hours, but it seems that there are issues with the logic and conditions for the adjustments, causing the function to fail.

In order to fix the bug in the `apply` function, the adjustment calculations need to be revised to ensure they correctly handle positive and negative values for `n` (number of business hours), and the business hours should be adjusted according to the specified conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust the input datetime based on business hours
        adjusted_datetime = other

        if self.n > 0:  # Adjust for positive n
            while self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) <= adjusted_datetime or not self.is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:  # Adjust for negative n
            while self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) >= adjusted_datetime or not self.is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                adjusted_datetime -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic for positive and negative `n` has been simplified to achieve the expected behavior. Now, the function should correctly adjust the business hours for the given input parameters and pass the failing tests.
