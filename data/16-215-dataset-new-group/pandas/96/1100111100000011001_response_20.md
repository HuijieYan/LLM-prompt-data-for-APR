This buggy function `apply` has issues related to time calculations, such as adjusting the time to reflect business hours and adding business days. We will analyze and fix the relevant parts of the function.

Upon analysis, it appears that there is an issue with the handling of time and business days in the `apply` function. Specifically, regarding the adjustment of time to reflect business hours and business days. 

The problem seems to be related to the logic in the code not producing the correct output for each of the given expected variables. 

To fix this function, we should review and correct the logic related to handling dates, times, and business days in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Note: This correction assumes that the related functions mentioned in the original `apply` function have correct and functional implementation. If those related functions are indeed problematic, then they need to be altered as well.
