The buggy function appears to be intended to adjust a datetime object by business hours. It seems to be triggered when using CustomBusinessHour, causing the failure in test_date_range_with_custom_holidays.

The primary issue is the calculation of business hours, which affects the adjustment of the datetime. It appears the calculation of businessdays is incorrect, leading to invalid adjustments.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the business hours calculation and adjustment logic in the function. The calculation of business hours needs to be accurate, considering the limits of open and close, and the adjustment of the datetime object.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # check if other falls within business hours
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # adjust to next business time interval
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # adjust by business days first
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                other = self._get_adjusted_date(other, bd)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                opened = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(opened) - other
                if bhour > bhour_remain:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _get_adjusted_date(self, date, business_days):
        # calculate adjusted date
        if business_days < 0:
            adjusted_date = date + timedelta(days=business_days)
        else:
            for _ in range(business_days):
                next_bdate = self.next_bday
                while not next_bdate.is_on_offset(date):
                    date += timedelta(days=1)
                date = date + next_bdate
        return date
```  

This corrected version takes into account the calculations of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime object to the subsequent business day when negative business days are provided. This should address the issue raised within test_date_range_with_custom_holidays and result in consistent behavior with the provided expected values for all test cases.
