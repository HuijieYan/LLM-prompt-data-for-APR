## The bug

The bug lies in the `apply` function, where the condition used for adjusting the datetime input based on the business hours is not correctly handling the case of negative business hours. This leads to unexpected date ranges including holidays and non-business days. The issue on GitHub provides a test case that demonstrates how using periods and adding holidays results in more periods than expected.

## Bug fix strategy

The main issue seems to occur when adjusting the datetime input based on the business hours, especially in the case of negative business hours. By reviewing the `apply` function and the related functions, we can find better ways to handle this adjustment to avoid unexpected date ranges.

## Updated function

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay

class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):
    def __add__(self, other):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.to_datetime(super().__add__(other))

class CustomBusinessDay(CustomBusinessDay):
    def __add__(self, other):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.to_datetime(super().__add__(other))

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # Adjust the other datetime based on the number of business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    while n >= 0 and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0 and (other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the `apply` function includes a restructured conditional block to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime based on the number of business hours are consistent and accurate. We are now avoiding unexpected date ranges caused by the incorrect handling of negative business hours.

By using this updated `apply` function, we can fix the bug and ensure that the date ranges involving holidays and non-business days are accurate and as expected.
