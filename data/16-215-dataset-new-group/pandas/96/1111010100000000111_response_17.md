The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` is causing issues with the `pd.date_range` function when adding holidays. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of business hours and holidays, resulting in an unexpected number of periods in the date range.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to properly handle business hours and holidays while generating the date range.

The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if holidays is not None:
                if isinstance(holidays, list):
                    holidays = pd.to_datetime(holidays).date.tolist()
                elif isinstance(holidays, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                    holidays = holidays.date.tolist()
                else:
                    raise TypeError('holidays should be a list or pd.DatetimeIndex')

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            ...

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            ...

            # handle holidays
            if holidays is not None:
                for holiday in holidays:
                    if holiday == other.date():
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # adjust total business hours
            ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have added a parameter `holidays` to the `apply` function to handle holidays. We then check for holidays and adjust the `other` datetime value accordingly. This modification should resolve the unexpected behavior observed when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays.

After fixing the `apply` function, it should be tested with the reported issue on GitHub to ensure that it no longer produces unexpected results when adding holidays to the date range.
