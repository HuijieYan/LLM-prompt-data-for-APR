The issue with the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is likely causing the bug. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the adjustment of dates when holidays are provided. 

The function is supposed to adjust the dates based on business hours, but it seems to be incorrectly adding additional periods when holidays are provided. This is causing the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test to fail. 

The expected behavior is that the function should correctly adjust the dates based on business hours, including handling holidays, and return the expected output in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic within the `apply` function related to the adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays. It may involve reviewing the logic for adjusting dates when holidays are present and ensuring that the function correctly stops at the specified number of periods instead of adding additional periods.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrections made to the apply function in the BusinessHourMixin class of the offsets.py file in the pandas library
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other class methods

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check for holidays and adjust dates based on business hours
            adjusted_dates = []  # Store the adjusted dates
            current_date = other

            while len(adjusted_dates) < self.n:  # Continue adjusting until the desired number of periods
                if current_date not in self.holidays and current_date.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_dates.append(current_date)
                current_date += timedelta(hours=1)  # Move to the next hour

            return adjusted_dates[-1]  # Return the last adjusted date

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected logic, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the dates based on business hours and holidays, ensuring that it returns the expected output for the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case.
