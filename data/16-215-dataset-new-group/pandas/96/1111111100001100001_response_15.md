The buggy function is applying certain business hour offsets to a given datetime object, but the code contains multiple potential errors leading to incorrect outputs. Based on the given runtime input/output variable values, we can identify a few issues:

1. The variable `businesshours` is calculated as the sum of seconds in the business hours for each day, but it is not clear if the sum is correct. This could be causing issues in computing the correct business day offset.

2. The logic for adjusting the given datetime object with the business day offset seems to be overly complex and prone to errors, leading to incorrect output values in some cases.

3. The adjustments made based on the calculated offset are not consistent and leading to incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the logic for adjusting the given datetime object with the business day offset needs to be simplified and made consistent. Additionally, the businesshours calculation should be verified for correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function based on the identified issues:

```python
# Import required for datetime
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

...

# The buggy function with corrected logic
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the main adjustments are made on the `other` datetime object based on the business day offsets. The conditions for adjusting the datetime object have been simplified and made consistent to ensure correct results.

This should address the issues identified and provide a more reliable fix for the buggy function.
