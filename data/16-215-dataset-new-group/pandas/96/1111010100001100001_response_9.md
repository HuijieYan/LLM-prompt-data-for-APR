The buggy function seems to be intended to apply a business day offset to a given datetime, adjusting for business hours within the time interval. However, there are multiple issues causing the buggy behavior and failing tests. 

1. The function is trying to handle both `datetime` and `Timestamp` objects, but it is doing so using a mix of methods that only apply to `datetime` objects (e.g., accessing attributes like `year`, `month`, etc.) and methods that apply specifically to `Timestamp` objects (e.g., `frequency`).

2. There are numerous conditional blocks used to adjust the input datetime, and these blocks don't appear to be handling all scenarios correctly, especially when dealing with negative offsets.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to consistently handle either `datetime` or `Timestamp` objects throughout the function.
2. Carefully review the conditional logic to ensure that it correctly adjusts the input datetime based on the provided business day offset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (date, datetime)):
            if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
                other = as_datetime(other)  # Convert Timestamp to datetime
            
            n = self.n
            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            iteration = abs(n)
            
            # Adjust other to the nearest business day first
            for _ in range(iteration):
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other += timedelta(days=direction)
        
            # Adjust the time within the business day
            while iteration > 0:
                if direction == 1 and other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                elif direction == -1 and other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    if direction == 1:
                        business_hours = (self.end[0].hour - other.hour) * 3600 + \
                                         (self.end[0].minute - other.minute) * 60 + \
                                         (self.end[0].second - other.second)
                    else:
                        business_hours = (other.hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600 + \
                                         (other.minute - self.start[0].minute) * 60 + \
                                         (other.second - self.start[0].second)
                    elapsed = min(business_hours, 60*n*60)  # Total elapsed time within business hours
                    other += timedelta(seconds=elapsed * direction)
                    iteration -= 1
                
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version distinctly handles `datetime` and `Timestamp` objects. It also eliminates unnecessary computations and simplifies the logic for adjusting the input datetime.
