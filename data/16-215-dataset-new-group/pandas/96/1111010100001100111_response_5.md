The issue seems to be related to the `CustomBusinessHour` not handling the holiday correctly when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated, as evident in the GitHub issue where adding holidays produces more than the expected number of periods.

### Potential Error Locations
The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class contains logic for adjusting datetime values based on business hour intervals. Given that using holidays can lead to incorrect behavior, it's likely that the bug lies in how the function handles holidays within the adjustment logic.

### Cause of the Bug
Based on the runtime input/output values, it appears that the datetime adjustment logic doesn't correctly account for holidays when performing the business hour adjustments. This leads to incorrect datetime values in the `CustomBusinessHour` intervals, resulting in the issue reported on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy should involve revisiting the logic within the `apply` function to ensure that holidays are correctly handled when adjusting datetime values based on business hours. This may involve updating the holiday detection and adjustment logic to consider holidays when determining the next opening time or the closing time within the business hours.

### Correction for the Buggy Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("The datetime provided is a holiday")

        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
``` 

The correction to the `apply` function involves adding a check for holidays at the beginning of the function. If the applied datetime falls on a holiday, it should raise an error to indicate that the datetime provided is a holiday and cannot be adjusted within the business hours. This will ensure that holidays are appropriately handled and prevent the issue observed in the GitHub report.
