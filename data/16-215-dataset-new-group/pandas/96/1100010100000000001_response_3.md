The buggy function seems to be intended to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime, adjusting it to the nearest business time interval. It first checks if the input is a datetime, and if so, it performs the adjustments based on the business hour offset.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the adjustment of the other datetime for both positive and negative business hour offsets, as well as the adjustment of the remaining business hours to ensure it aligns with business time intervals.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset is convoluted and contains potential errors with the adjustments and comparisons being made, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to simplify the logic and use a more straightforward approach to adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourOffset:
    def __init__(self, start_time, end_time):
        self.start_time = start_time
        self.end_time = end_time

    def apply(self, business_datetime, offset):
        if not isinstance(business_datetime, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        if offset >= 0:
            business_datetime += self._get_next_opening_delta(business_datetime)
        else:
            business_datetime += self._get_previous_closing_delta(business_datetime)

        business_days = offset // 8  # Assuming 8 business hours in a day
        business_hours_remaining = offset % 8  # Remaining business hours

        if business_days != 0:
            business_datetime += timedelta(days=business_days)

        if business_hours_remaining > 0:
            business_datetime += self._get_next_opening_delta(business_datetime, count=business_hours_remaining)
        elif business_hours_remaining < 0:
            business_datetime += self._get_previous_closing_delta(business_datetime, count=abs(business_hours_remaining))

        return business_datetime

    def _get_next_opening_delta(self, business_datetime, count=1):
        next_opening_datetime = datetime(business_datetime.year, business_datetime.month, business_datetime.day, self.start_time)
        while next_opening_datetime <= business_datetime:
            next_opening_datetime += timedelta(hours=24)
        return next_opening_datetime - business_datetime

    def _get_previous_closing_delta(self, business_datetime, count=1):
        previous_closing_datetime = datetime(business_datetime.year, business_datetime.month, business_datetime.day, self.end_time)
        while previous_closing_datetime >= business_datetime:
            previous_closing_datetime -= timedelta(hours=24)
        return business_datetime - previous_closing_datetime

# Example usage
offset = BusinessHourOffset(8, 17)  # Business hours from 8 AM to 5 PM
business_datetime = datetime(2022, 10, 17, 10, 30)  # October 17, 2022, 10:30 AM
new_datetime = offset.apply(business_datetime, 5)  # Add 5 business hours
print(new_datetime)  # Output the adjusted datetime
``` 

In this corrected version, a class `BusinessHourOffset` is defined to handle the business hour offset. The `apply` method takes the input datetime and the offset and uses a simplified logic to adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset. The methods `_get_next_opening_delta` and `_get_previous_closing_delta` are used to calculate the delta to the next opening time and the previous closing time, respectively.

This approach simplifies the logic and should provide the correct adjustments for the business hour offset.
