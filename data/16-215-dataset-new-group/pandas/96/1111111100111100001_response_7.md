Looking at the buggy code, the main issue appears to be related to the business day calculations within the `apply` function, specifically the logic for adjusting the provided timestamp to business hours.

One potential issue lies in the section that adjusts the provided timestamp according to the business hour rules. The logic seems to be intricate, and it's likely that there are multiple conditions where the adjustment doesn't work as expected.

A suggestion to fix the bug is to carefully review and update the business day calculations logic, ensuring that the adjustments to the timestamp align with the business hours in a more clear and concise manner.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is a corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.on_offset(other):  # Check if the provided timestamp is on a business hour
            return other  # Return the timestamp as is if it's already on a business hour

        # If the provided timestamp is not on a business hour, adjust it to the next business hour
        next_business_hour = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        return next_business_hour  # Return the adjusted timestamp
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the business day calculations and should address the issues with the original buggy code.

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected version against various input scenarios to ensure its correctness and reliability.
