The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is part of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. The function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to given dates. 

The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expecting the application of a custom business hour frequency to a date range. The specific custom frequency is defined to start at 3 PM with a holiday on November 26, and the test is expecting the dates to be incremented by one business hour for each step.

The error message is a `ValueError` raised from the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class, with the specific error being that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH (CustomBusinessHour).

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it is clear that the logic for handling business hours and adjusting dates may not align with the frequency requirements, which might be causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dates are correctly modified based on the business hour offsets and the custom business hour frequencies. It's possible that the logic in the `apply` function is not correctly handling the business hour offsets for custom frequencies.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    # Fix for the buggy function
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # the same business day
            if other.time() in self:
                return other
    
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.starts:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
    
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the date is correctly adjusted based on the business hour offsets and the custom frequency. Now, when the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is executed, it should pass without raising a `ValueError`.
