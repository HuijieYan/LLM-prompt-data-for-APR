The issue stems from the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is part of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. The `apply` function is responsible for applying the offset calculation for custom business hours, with the `CustomBusinessHour` class being involved. The failing test case relates to the application of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset in the `pd.date_range` function when adding holidays. 

Upon analyzing the failing test case and the provided information, it can be inferred that the bug is preventing the correct calculation of the date range when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays.

In order to fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Carefully analyze and correct the adjustments being made to the `other` datetime when calculating the offset, especially when `other` is adjusted to reduce the number of cases to handle based on the value of `n` (custom business hour offset).
2. Verify the adjustment for negative values of `n` to ensure it correctly handles the condition when `other.time()` is in the `self.start`.
3. Ensure that the adjustments made to `other` do not result in an incorrect date output when adding business days.
4. Address any potential unexpected behavior related to the addition of holidays in the date range calculation.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function to resolve the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing the failing test related to the incorrect calculation of the date range with `CustomBusinessHour` offset and holidays should be fixed.
