The bug lies in the application of business hours and the adjustments made to the 'other' time variable. The code calculates the business hours and attempts to adjust the time based on a custom business day and business hours configuration. However, the implementation of the adjustment logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect output.

The corrected version of the code would involve fixing the adjustment logic based on the custom business day configuration and applying the correct handling of business hour adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other += CustomBusinessHour(n=n)
        else:
            n = abs(n)
            other -= CustomBusinessHour(n=n)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version will properly adjust the timestamp 'other' by a custom business hour 'n' number of times. This approach simplifies the adjustment logic by directly adding or subtracting the CustomBusinessHour offset based on the sign of 'n'.
