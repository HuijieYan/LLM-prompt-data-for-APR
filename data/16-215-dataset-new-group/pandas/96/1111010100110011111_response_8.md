The corrected version includes separate methods within the `BusinessHourMixin` class to handle the adjustments and calculations needed for the `apply` function, improving clarity and maintainability. The separate methods encapsulate specific functionality, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided cases. As a result, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
