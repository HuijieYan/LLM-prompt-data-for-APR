The bug in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an issue with the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case due to an `ApplyTypeError` being raised. The error message indicates that the frequency derived from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

Upon analyzing the problem, it seems that the bug is likely originating from the `apply` function. The function is intended to apply a custom business hour offset to a datetime object, but it seems to be incorrectly computing the dates and times.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the dates and times needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.on_offset(other)
        else:
            if self.is_on_offset(other + timedelta(seconds=1)):
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = self._previous_opening_time(other)
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.previous_bday.on_offset(other)
                other = self.get_closing_time(other-datetime.timedelta(nanoseconds=1))

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self.get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other = other + timedelta(days=bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self.get_closing_time(self._previous_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.next_bday.on_offset(self._next_opening_time(other))
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other - timedelta(minutes=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

These changes should ensure that the function properly applies the custom business hour offset to the given datetime object. Once applied and tested, the corrected function should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test case.
