The buggy function is failing at multiple test cases due to having some conditional logic based on minute, second, and microsecond components of the `other` datetime parameter when adjusting other to reduce the number of cases to handle. The function is also failing to accurately handle positive and negative values for the number of business days (`n`).

The buggy function's parameters include `other` which is a datetime, its year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond components, `self.n`, `self`, `self.end`, `self.start`, and `self.next_bday` which are instances of some specific classes.

The cause of the bug is due to inaccurate conditional logic, which is leading to incorrect calculations and resulting in the wrong output.

The main strategy to fix the bug is to modify the conditional logic to correctly handle the adjustments to the `other` datetime and the number of business days `n`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        har = 60
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            for future_business_day in range(abs(n)):
                while True:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        continue
                    else:
                        break
        else:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            for future_business_day in range(n):
                while True:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        continue
                    else:
                        break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, we have modified the conditional logic to work with business days and adjusted the `other` datetime accordingly for both positive and negative values of `n`. This should resolve the bug and provide the expected output for all test cases.
