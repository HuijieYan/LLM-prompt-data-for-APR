The buggy function `apply` has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function tries to reset the `datetime` object, which may lead to inconsistencies.
2. There are multiple `while` loops that seem to be redundant and should be simplified.
3. The condition checks need to be more clearly defined to avoid the unnecessary complexity.

The overall strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic using conditional checks, avoid resetting the `datetime` object, and handle the different cases of `n` efficiently.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
   
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(minutes=1)
  
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other)
    
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the main changes made include avoiding unnecessary resets of the `datetime` object and simplifying the logic to handle the positive and negative cases of `n` efficiently. The code is reorganized to avoid redundant operations and improve readability.

With these changes, the corrected `apply` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
