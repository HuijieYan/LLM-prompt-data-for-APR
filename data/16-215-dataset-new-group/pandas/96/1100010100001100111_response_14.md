The buggy function `apply` is attempting to manipulate datetime objects and adjust them based on custom business hours. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, it produces more than the specified number of periods.

Upon analyzing the variable values and types at the function's return in each runtime case, it appears that the adjustments for `businesshours`, `bd`, `r`, and `bhour` are not correctly accounting for the specified business hours, potentially leading to incorrect calculations and adjustments, which results in unexpected dates being returned.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic for adjusting the business hours, accounting for the specified holiday, and adjusting the datetime object accordingly. Furthermore, identifying and addressing any edge cases or off-by-one errors in the adjustments is crucial.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # code to handle holiday adjustment
        if other in self.holidays:
            business_day = BusinessDay(n=1 if n >= 0 else -1)
            other = business_day.apply(other)

        # business hours adjustment
        business_day_duration = sum(
            (en - st).seconds for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        total_seconds = n * business_day_duration

        business_day_offset = timedelta(seconds=0)

        if n < 0:
            total_seconds += (60 - other.second)
            total_seconds += (60 - other.minute) * 60
            total_seconds += (self.start[0].hour - other.hour - 1) * 3600
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, 0)

        business_day_offset = timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)

        other += business_day_offset

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment logic for business hours and holidays has been re-evaluated to ensure accurate calculations and adjustments of the datetime object. Additionally, if a specified holiday falls on the given datetime, it is appropriately handled.
