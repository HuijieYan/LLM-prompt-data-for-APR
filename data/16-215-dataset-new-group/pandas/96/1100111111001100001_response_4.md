The bug in the provided code lies in the way adjustments are made to the datetime object 'other' within the apply function, which is used to add or subtract custom business hours from a given timestamp. It seems that the logic for adjusting the business hours and days is incorrect. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the bug and a corrected version of the code:

### Issue Analysis
The apply function incorrectly adjusts the datetime object 'other' to add or subtract business hours and days. Some key issues include:
1. Adjustment logic for adding or subtracting business hours and days is not handled correctly.
2. There is a possibility of an incorrect calculation for 'r' and 'bd' values.
3. The comparison and manipulation of timedelta objects may lead to wrong results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the apply function, you should:
1. Correct the adjustment logic to accurately add or subtract business hours and days.
2. Review the calculations for 'r' and 'bd' to ensure they yield expected results.
3. Ensure that timedelta objects are compared and manipulated correctly.

### Corrections to the Buggy Function

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class CustomBusinessHour:
    # Other class methods and attributes

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n

            # Initial adjustment logic
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Business hours logic and adjustment
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Handle business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours logic and adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrections, the apply function and its related adjustments should work correctly and pass the failing tests.
