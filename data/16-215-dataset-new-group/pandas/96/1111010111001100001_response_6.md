The buggy function has a few mistakes. It is adding and subtracting timedelta objects to the datetime object 'other' to adjust the business hours, but the logic seems to be incorrect. The return value 'other' is not adjusted correctly based on the input parameters and business hours. 

The specific issues in this function seem to be related to the inaccurate handling of business days, business hours, and the adjustment of the datetime object based on these attributes. 

To fix the bug, here's a suggested strategy:
1. Carefully analyze the logic used to adjust the datetime object 'other' and ensure that it accurately reflects the expected behavior for the specified business hours.
2. Review the calculation of business days and business hours to properly adjust the 'other' datetime object based on these values.
3. Debug the loop that adjusts the business hours and ensure that it correctly updates the 'other' datetime object and the remaining hours.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            while n < 0:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                while other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test case should pass, and the adjustments to the datetime object 'other' should be correctly handled based on the specified business hours and business days.
