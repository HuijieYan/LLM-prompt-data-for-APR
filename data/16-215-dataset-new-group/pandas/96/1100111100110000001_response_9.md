The bug seems to be related to the `_validate_frequency` function from the failing test. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH.

Looking through the buggy function, it seems that there is a missing attribute or method that is not being referenced correctly. The bug is likely related to the `next_bday` attribute not being called correctly. The method being called is `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`, but it should be `self.next_bday()`. 

To fix this bug, the `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` should be replaced with `self.next_bday()` to properly call the method to check if the input date is on the next business day.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace

        )

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
