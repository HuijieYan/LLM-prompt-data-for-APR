The buggy function "apply" modifies the input datetime based on certain business hour conditions. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly compute business days and hours when applying custom business hours with holidays.

The issue on GitHub demonstrates that when using the buggy function "apply" with the "pd.date_range" function and adding holidays, it produces more than the expected number of periods, indicating that the business hours are not being correctly applied.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are mainly in the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours and the presence of holidays.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect logic in the "apply" function when adjusting the input datetime to account for holidays and business hours. The incorrect computation of business days and hours, especially when negative adjustments are required, leads to the incorrect number of periods being generated in the "pd.date_range."

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review and correct the logic in the "apply" function for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and holidays. Specifically, the computation of business days and hours should be revisited to ensure that they accurately reflect the expected behavior when adjusting the datetime.

Here is a corrected version of the "apply" function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            if self.is_on_offset(other, holidays=self.holidays):
                other = self.next_bday(other, n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
            else:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self.next_bday(other, n=bd, holidays=self.holidays) + timedelta(seconds=r*60)
                else:
                    other = self.prev_bday(other, n=-bd, holidays=self.holidays) - timedelta(seconds=r*60)

        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays) - other
                if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour, holidays=self.holidays)
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
        else:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
                if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the logic in the "apply" function, ensuring proper adjustment of the input datetime based on the holidays and business hours, the corrected version should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
