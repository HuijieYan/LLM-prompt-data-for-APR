The buggy function contains a conditional check for `isinstance(other, datetime)` which is used to determine if adjustments need to be made to the input `other`. The issue arises from how the adjustments are being made when `n` is less than 0 and the logic flow inside the conditional block. It seems that when `n` is less than 0, the adjustments to `other` are not producing the correct results, leading to incorrect periods in the output.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to review the logic for adjusting `other` when `n` is less than 0. It's also important to ensure that `other` is accurately adjusted for the business hours and holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            start_time = other if self._is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = start_time + skip_bd

        if r:
            current_time = other if self._is_on_offset(other) else self._next_opening_time(other)
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_time) - current_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = current_time - self._prev_opening_time(current_time)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_time = self._prev_opening_time(current_time - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting `other` when `n` is less than 0 has been updated to handle the negative business day (`bd`) and the remaining business hours (`r`) separately. This should ensure that `other` is correctly adjusted in all scenarios, including holidays, and produces the expected periods in the output.

The corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
