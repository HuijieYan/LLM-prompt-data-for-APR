Looking at the buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, we can see that the function is attempting to adjust a datetime object based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The bug likely exists in the logic that adjusts the datetime object to account for business hours, holidays, and other factors.

One potential error location is the logic that adjusts the input datetime object based on the business hours and holidays. The adjustment logic for positive and negative n values may not be correctly handling edge cases, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug can be inferred from the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values. It appears that when using the `CustomBusinessHour` with a specified holiday, the logic in the `apply` function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object within business hours while considering the holiday, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we should review and refine the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours, the specified holiday, and the n value. The adjustment logic needs to correctly handle both positive and negative n values, ensuring that the resulting datetime object aligns with the expected business hours while accounting for holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# Import required module
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_hours = np.busday_count(other, other + timedelta(days=1), holidays=self.holidays) * 60
            target_datetime = other + BusinessDay(n=n)
            closing_day = self._get_closing_time(target_datetime)
            adjusted_time = timedelta(minutes=0)
            while adjusted_time < timedelta(minutes=business_hours):
                if n >= 0:
                    target_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if target_time.time() not in self.end:
                        other = target_time
                    else:
                        next_business_day = self.next_bday + other
                        if next_business_day.time() in self.start:
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._just_get_closing_time(other)
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_hours_interval = opening_time - other
                    next_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    remaining_hours = next_closing_time - opening_time
                    while remaining_hours < timedelta(minutes=0):
                        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(opening_time)
                        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        remaining_hours = closing_time - opening_time
                    other = next_closing_time
                    adjusted_time += next_closing_time - other

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this version, we have used the `np.busday_count` function to calculate the business hours for a given datetime range, and then adjusted the datetime object based on the calculated business hours and holiday. We also handle both positive and negative n values to align the adjusted datetime object with the expected business hours while considering the holiday.
