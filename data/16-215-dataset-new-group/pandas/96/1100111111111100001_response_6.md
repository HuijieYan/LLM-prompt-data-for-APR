The bug in the code causes the failing test to raise a ValueError due to frequency validation issues. The CustomBusinessHour object's frequency is not compatible with the passed timestamps, leading to an incorrect output.

The problem in the code appears to be related to the logic for handling business hour adjustments and the comparison of timestamps within the if-else conditional blocks.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks inside the apply function should be reviewed and adjusted, ensuring that the logic follows the intended business hour adjustments and comparisons with timestamps.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    n -= 1
                    if n == 0:
                        break
            return other
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    n += 1
                    if n == 0:
                        break
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the logic inside the apply function as shown above, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
