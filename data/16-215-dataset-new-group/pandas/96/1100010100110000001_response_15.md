The bug occurs in the apply function within the pandas/tseries/offsets.py file. The bug is manifested as a ValueError when a test is run to validate the frequency of datetime index values with a custom business hour. The error message states: "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH".

Upon analyzing the code, the potential bug location is within the apply function. Specifically, in the if statement which handles the case when the "other" variable is not an instance of datetime.

The cause of the bug is a logic error in the elif branch of the if-else statement that checks if the "other" is not an instance of datetime. The current implementation is raising an ApplyTypeError which is not aligned with the intended functionality. The bug likely lies in incorrect handling of non-datetime instances.

To fix the bug, we need to update the else block to remove the incorrect logic. After that, the function should return a default value other than applying the raise ApplyTypeError. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing working code, not shown for brevity) ...
    else:
        return None  # Return a default value when "other" is not an instance of datetime
```
The correction involves modifying the else block of the apply function to return a default value, such as None, instead of raising the ApplyTypeError. 
This change ensures that the code will not mistakenly raise an error when "other" is not an instance of datetime.
