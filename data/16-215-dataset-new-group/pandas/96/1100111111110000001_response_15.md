The bug seems to be causing an issue with the application of a custom business hour offset, resulting in a ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH.

The bug is likely located in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file within the `pandas` library.

The potential cause of the bug could be the mishandling of the `freq` parameter within the `apply` function. It seems that the function is unable to handle the custom business hour offset correctly, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `apply` function to properly handle custom business hour offsets and adjust the datetime based on the given parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file in the `pandas` library:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # existing functions ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # the existing logic ...

            if isinstance(self, pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self.rollforward(other)
                else:
                    other = self.rollback(other)
                
                return other
            
            # the remaining existing logic ...

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we add a specific handling for instances of `CustomBusinessHour` by using the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods to adjust the datetime based on the custom business hour offset. This modification should address the bug and ensure that the `apply` function properly handles custom business hour offsets.

Once this corrected code is implemented, it should pass the failing test without raising the ValueError.
