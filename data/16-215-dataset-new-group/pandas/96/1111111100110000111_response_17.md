The bug in the `apply` function causes unexpected behavior in the `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The issue on the GitHub repository confirms this bug and provides detailed information about its impact and expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is likely a miscalculation or misinterpretation of custom business hours when adding holidays. The error message points to a direct violation of expected behavior when inferring frequency and passing values that do not conform to the specified frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to address the logic of how the custom business hours are applied when considering holidays and ensure that it correctly determines the number of periods to generate. This may involve cross-referencing the holiday dates and adjusting the periods accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import the necessary packages
import numpy as np

# Existing functions and classes remain the same

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other functions and classes
    
    # Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code remains the same
            # ... (other code remains the same)

            # Some new code to detect and skip holidays
            holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
            for holiday in holidays:
                if other.date() == holiday.date():
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Remaining code remains the same

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function includes an additional check for holidays that will skip those dates when calculating the custom business hours. This check should help address the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.
