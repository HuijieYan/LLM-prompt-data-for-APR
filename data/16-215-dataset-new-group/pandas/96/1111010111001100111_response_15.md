The bug in the `BusinessHourMixin` class likely stems from incorrect calculations and adjustments required to handle business hours and holidays. The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust a given datetime based on the custom business hours and holidays. However, it fails to properly handle holidays and adjust the datetime, leading to unexpected outputs.

The specific error location seems to be within the adjustment logic when business hours fall on or around holiday dates. The function incorrectly calculates the adjusted datetime in these scenarios.

The bug likely causes the incorrect handling of business hours around holidays, leading to unexpected outputs from the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The returned dates might differ from the expected behavior because of the incorrect adjustments made in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied to handle holidays and business hours. Specifically, the code should properly account for holidays and adjust the datetime values accordingly to align with the expected business hours.

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessHour, CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from pandas.tseries import offsets
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import apply_wraps
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # the corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Apply adjustments based on business days and business hours
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # Handle remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    bhour = closing_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                        other = opening_time
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = opening_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code now correctly applies adjustments to handle business days, business hours, and holidays. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the `pd.date_range` function works as expected when dealing with periods and adding holidays.
