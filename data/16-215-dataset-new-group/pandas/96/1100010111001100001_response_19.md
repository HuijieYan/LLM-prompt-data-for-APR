Looking at the buggy function, it appears to be a method for adjusting datetime values by a given custom business hour. The function should take a datetime input and adjust it to the nearest business hour based on specific business hour rules. However, there seem to be issues in the adjustments made, leading to failing test cases.

The fix strategy should involve revising the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days. Additionally, the function should correctly handle edge cases and holidays as per the provided input.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            elif not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(self.next_bday.rollback(other))

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.rollback(other) if other.weekday() >= 5 else self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = other + bd * self.next_bday
        minutes_adjust = r // (businesshours // 60) * self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)).minute
        other = other + timedelta(minutes=minutes_adjust)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the given corrected implementation, the failing test case should pass successfully.
