The issue in the function lies in the logic related to the adjustment of the datetime `other` based on the business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The adjustment process involves handling negative and positive offsets, business day adjustments, and remaining business hours adjustments. The calculation and adjustment logic is leading to incorrect output for the given test cases.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for positive and negative offsets, business day adjustments, and remaining business hour adjustments need to be revised to ensure accurate adjustment of the `other` datetime.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
...
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n != 0:
            skip_bd = self.next_bday(n=n)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # carry out remaining business hours adjustments
        remaining_seconds = n * 60 * 60  # converting minutes to seconds
        while remaining_seconds != 0:
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
            time_until_next_opening = (next_opening - other).total_seconds()
            if n >= 0:
                if time_until_next_opening <= remaining_seconds:
                    remaining_seconds -= time_until_next_opening
                    other = next_opening
                else:
                    other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
            else:
                if time_until_next_opening >= remaining_seconds:
                    remaining_seconds += 60  # to include nanosecond check
                    other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    remaining_seconds -= time_until_next_opening
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After making these adjustments, the updated function should now pass the failing test.
