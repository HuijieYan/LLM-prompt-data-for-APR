The issue seems to be related to the use of `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, where adding holidays causes more periods to be generated than expected. The test case provided in the GitHub issue indicates that the behavior is not as expected when using `pd.date_range` with the specified parameters and frequency.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the business hour adjustments for both positive and negative values of `n`, as well as in the calculation of business hours and adjustment by business days.

The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect adjustments within the function, leading to the generation of more periods than expected. The adjustments for business hours and business days seem to be causing the issue, resulting in an incorrect frequency output.

To fix the bug, the adjustments for business hours and business days need to be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure the correct generation of periods.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for edge conditions
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                prev_close = self._get_closing_time(prev_open)
                if remain == timedelta(0):
                    remain = self._get_business_time_interval(prev_open, prev_close)
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_time_interval(other, self._get_closing_time(other))
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_time_interval(self._prev_opening_time(other), other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the adjustments for the number of business days and remaining business hours. It ensures that the correct adjustments are made before returning the `other` datetime object. With these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
