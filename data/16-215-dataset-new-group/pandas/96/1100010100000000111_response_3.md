There is an issue with the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file that is related to the provided GitHub issue. The issue is related to the use of `CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays when generating a date range. The function produces unexpected results when holidays are added to the frequency.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function are:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays and its impact on business hours.
2. Improper adjustment of business hours when adding or subtracting days.
3. Failure to account for holidays in the calculation of business hours and open/close times.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function does not handle the addition of holidays correctly when computing business hours and adjusting the datetime. This results in an unexpected date range and failure to skip the holidays as intended.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the addition of holidays, adjust business hours according to holidays, and factor in the holidays when computing open/close times.

Given the buggy function and the GitHub issue, here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self.onOffset(other):
            other = self.adjust_holidays(other, n)

        business_hours = self.get_business_hours()

        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            other = self.adjust_by_business_days(other, business_days)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_minutes = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        while remaining_minutes != timedelta(0):
            remaining_minutes = self.adjust_remaining_hours(remaining_minutes, other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the corrected `apply` function. The actual fix may involve additional code modifications depending on the complete structure and requirements of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
