The buggy function is `apply` inside the `offsets.py` file in the `pandas` library. The function is meant to be used for business time offset calculations. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic inside the `if n >= 0` and `if n < 0` conditions seems to be incorrect.
2. The adjustment of the `other` variable based on the business days is not functioning as expected.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable based on the business days and business hours, leading to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing and correcting the logic inside the `if n >= 0` and `if n < 0` conditions, as well as ensuring that the adjustments made to the `other` variable based on business days and business hours are correct.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        total_seconds = n * businesshours

        if n >= 0:
            # If n is positive, move the other to the next opening time or the previous closing time
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(total_seconds, 3600 * businesshours)
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)
            
            while remaining_seconds > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_seconds < bhour.total_seconds():
                    other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    remaining_seconds -= bhour.total_seconds()
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) 
                    
        else:
            # If n is negative, move the other to the previous opening time or the next closing time
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(total_seconds), 3600 * businesshours)
            other -= timedelta(days=business_days)
            
            while remaining_seconds > 0:
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if remaining_seconds < bhour.total_seconds():
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    remaining_seconds -= bhour.total_seconds()
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
After making these corrections, the function should pass the failing test.
