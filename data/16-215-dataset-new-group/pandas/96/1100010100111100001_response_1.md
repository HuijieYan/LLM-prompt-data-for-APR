The bug in the function is likely causing the error message, which raises a ValueError. The code is intended to combine business hours with a datetime object but appears to be performing some incorrect adjustments to the datetime component, leading to an inconsistency between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

Upon analyzing the code and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the main cause of the bug is the logic used to adjust the datetime object while handling the business hours. This is evident from the fact that the function is attempting operations such as adjusting the datetime for business days and hours, comparing the time with start and end times, and performing calculations to move to the next business time interval.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revisiting the logic within the function, specifically the adjustments made to the datetime object based on business hours and days. Additionally, it would be beneficial to thoroughly review the business hour and day calculation methods to ensure that they are being applied correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # performing adjustments to the datetime based on business hours and days
        business_hours_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute)
        business_hours_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > business_hours_end.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = business_hours_start + timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._get_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < business_hours_start.time():
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are based on comparing the time with the start and end times and performing appropriate operations accordingly. The adjustments for moving to the next or previous business day and time intervals are recalculated to ensure consistency with the business hours and days.
