The bug appears to be caused by the application of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in conjunction with holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior and an incorrect number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of holidays within the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency implementation, causing the test case to fail.

The cause of the bug lies in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class, where adjustments for holidays and business hours are not being accurately applied.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `apply` method to correctly handle the adjustments for holidays and business hours, ensuring that the expected number of periods is generated.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            next_period = other + pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(n=1, start=self.end[0])

            while other >= next_period or next_period in self.holidays:
                if next_period in self.holidays:
                    next_period += self
                    next_period = next_period.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                else:
                    next_period += self

            return next_period
        else:
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments for holidays are accurately applied, ensuring that the correct number of periods are generated.

This fix should address the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report and ensure that `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays produces the expected number of periods.
