The bug in the given function is causing errors in the test_date_range_with_custom_holidays test. The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the business hours and offsets when applying custom business hours. It is resulting in incorrect calculations of the next opening time and closing time, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours, business days, and business time intervals. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours and moving to the next business time interval needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust time to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=0
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if n != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - next_open
                other = next_open + BusinessDay(n=n) + remain
            else:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=n)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        total_minutes = n * 60
        if n < 0:
            total_minutes = -total_minutes
        delta = timedelta(minutes=total_minutes)

        while delta != timedelta(0):
            if n < 0:
                delta = self._prev_opening_time(other) - other
            else:
                delta = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if n < 0 and delta.days >= 0:
                delta = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if n >= 0:
                if delta != timedelta(0):
                    other += delta
                    delta = timedelta(0)
            else:
                if delta == timedelta(0) and other.nanosecond != 0:
                    other += delta
                    delta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    delta -= other
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other + delta)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the function will handle the adjustments to business hours and business days correctly. It should pass the test_date_range_with_custom_holidays test without errors.
