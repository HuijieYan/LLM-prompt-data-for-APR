Looking at the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the logic used to calculate adjusted business hours for a given datetime. The function seems to be failing to correctly calculate the adjusted datetime, leading to a ValueError.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the business hours and the adjustment logic. The function is not properly adjusting the given datetime based on the business hours and seems to be causing an issue with the validity of the frequency.

One potential strategy for fixing this bug could be to review and revise the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. A careful review and adjustment of the business hours calculation and the adjustment logic would be needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0)

        # handle positive and negative adjustments separately
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate business hour adjustments
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        adj_minutes = n * 60

        # adjust by business days
        adj_days, adj_minutes = divmod(abs(adj_minutes), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            adj_days, adj_minutes = -adj_days, -adj_minutes

        # handle adjustments for business days
        if adj_days != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=adj_days)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=adj_minutes)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    return other + bhour_remain
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    return other + bhour_remain

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

You can plug this corrected function back into the source code and rerun the failing tests to confirm that the issue has been resolved.
