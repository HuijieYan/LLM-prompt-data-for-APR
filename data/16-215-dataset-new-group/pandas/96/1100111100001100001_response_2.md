The buggy function seems to be incorrectly calculating business hours when adjusting the datetime based on a given offset. The logic seems to be inaccurate, leading to incorrect adjustments in some cases. 

After analyzing multiple cases, it seems the issue arises when calculating the business days and remaining business hours to adjust. Additionally, the conditions to finish adjusting the business hours are not correctly captured, leading to incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours, as well as the conditions for finishing the adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        abs_n = abs(self.n)
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Calculate business days to adjust
        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        adjusted_time = other
        
        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            adjusted_time += CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                bhour = next_opening - adjusted_time
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_time = next_opening
                else:
                    adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    break
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                bhour = closing_time - adjusted_time
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_time = closing_time
                else:
                    adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    break
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised function aims to correctly calculate the new adjusted time based on the provided offset, adjusting for business days and remaining business hours in a more accurate manner.

It's important to test the corrected function using various scenarios to ensure it works as expected.
