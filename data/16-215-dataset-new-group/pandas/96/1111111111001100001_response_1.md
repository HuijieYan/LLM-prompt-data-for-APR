The bug in the given implementation is caused by incorrect handling of business day adjustment and remaining business hours calculation when adjusting the input timestamp. The algorithm to handle business day adjustment and remaining business hours has logical issues, leading to incorrect adjustments and incorrect return values. The incorrect handling of the `self.next_bday` attribute and the calculation of `bhour_remain` is also causing the bug.

To fix the bug, the algorithm to handle business day adjustment and remaining business hours needs to be corrected. It's crucial to calculate the business day adjustment correctly and then adjust the remaining business hours based on that. Additionally, the correct attribute or function needs to be used for checking if a given timestamp is a business day through the `self.next_bday` attribute. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# ... (other function and class declarations remain the same)

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other function declarations remain the same)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # Move to the closing time

            if n != 0:
                # Calculate remaining business hours based on total business hours and adjust by business days first
                businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r

                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        # Calculation for midnight business hours
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd

                # Adjust remaining business hours
                if r != 0:
                    if n >= 0:
                        while r != 0:
                            bhour = (
                                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                            )
                            if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                                other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                                r = 0
                            else:
                                r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        while r != 0:
                            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                            if r > bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                                other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                                r = 0
                            else:
                                r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                                other = self._get_closing_time(
                                    self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(minutes=1))
                                )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function is expected to handle the business day adjustment and remaining business hours calculation accurately.

If there are other classes or functions related to the `CustomBusinessHour` and `CustomBusinessDay` classes, make sure those classes are also correctly implemented to support the adjustments and business day calculations.

After implementing these changes, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass, ensuring that the bug has been fixed.
