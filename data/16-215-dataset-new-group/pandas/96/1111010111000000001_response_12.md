The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust timestamps to the next or previous business hours. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Calculation of business hours using `sum` and `self._get_business_hours_by_sec`.
2. Adjusting the remaining business hours to adjust using a while loop.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the custom business hour start time and holidays, resulting in incorrect timestamps being returned.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the custom business hour start time and holidays, as well as properly adjust the timestamps based on these criteria.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        direction_multiplier = 1 if self.n >= 0 else -1

        other_time = other.time()
        is_start = other_time in self.start
        is_end = other_time in self.end

        if is_start or (not is_end and self._is_on_offset(other)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif not is_end:
            other = self._get_closing_time(
                other if direction_multiplier > 0 else self._previous_closing_time(other)
            )

        other += direction_multiplier * self.n * self._offset

        while not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other += direction_multiplier * self._offset

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
