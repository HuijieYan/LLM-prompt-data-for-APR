The identified problem in the buggy function is that it does not correctly adjust business hours when holidays are provided in the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` parameters. This causes `pd.date_range` to produce incorrect results. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` specifically reveals this issue.

The error message from the failing test indicates a failure in the frequency validation, likely due to incorrect adjustments within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

Additionally, the GitHub issue further confirms that the buggy function is not handling holidays correctly when using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays and produce the correct results when they are provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # if other date is a holiday, adjust it by skipping to the next business day
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # rest of the function remains the same...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we've added a conditional check to handle holidays. If the current date is a holiday, it is adjusted to the next business day. This should ensure that the `pd.date_range` will produce the correct results when holidays are provided.

This corrected version of the function should address the problem and resolve the GitHub issue linked to the bug.
