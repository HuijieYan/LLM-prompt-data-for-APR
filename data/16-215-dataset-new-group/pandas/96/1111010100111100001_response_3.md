The bug is caused by the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class not correctly adjusting dates based on business hours. It seems to manipulate the date values and then perform business hour adjustments, leading to incorrect results and a ValueError during the frequency validation process.

The bug can be fixed by adjusting dates based on business hours before manipulating their values, ensuring consistent results and avoiding run-time errors during frequency validation. 

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businessdays = n // 8
        hours = n % 8

        if n >= 0:
            # Move to next business day if necessary
            while other.weekday() > 4 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)

            # Skip weekends and holidays
            for _ in range(businessdays):
                other += timedelta(days=1)
                while other.weekday() > 4 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)

            # Adjust for business hours
            if other.time() >= self.end[0]:  # After business hours
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute)
                other += timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            # Move to previous business day if necessary
            while other.weekday() > 4 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)

            # Skip weekends and holidays
            for _ in range(abs(businessdays)):
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
                while other.weekday() > 4 or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)

            # Adjust for business hours
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:  # Before business hours
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute)
                other -= timedelta(days=1)

        # Adjust for business hours if n != 0
        if hours:
            business_seconds = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 3600 + (self.end[0].minute - self.start[0].minute) * 60
            direction = hours // abs(hours)
            remaining_seconds = abs(hours) * business_seconds * direction
            while remaining_seconds != 0:
                if direction == 1 and other.time() < self.end[0]:
                    bhour = (datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute) - other).total_seconds()
                    if remaining_seconds < bhour:
                        other += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                        remaining_seconds = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_seconds -= bhour
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute) + timedelta(days=1)
                elif direction == -1 and other.time() > self.start[0]:
                    bhour = (other - datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute)).total_seconds()
                    if remaining_seconds < bhour:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                        remaining_seconds = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_seconds -= bhour
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute) - timedelta(days=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the date based on business hours before manipulating its values, we ensure the correct results and avoid a ValueError during the frequency validation process.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
