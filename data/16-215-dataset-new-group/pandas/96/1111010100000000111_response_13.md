The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime object to align with a custom business hour frequency, but it contains a bug that causes unexpected behavior when used with holidays in the Pandas `date_range` function. The bug can be attributed to the calculation of the business hours and the adjustment of the datetime object with respect to the custom business hour frequency.

The issue reported on GitHub "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" describes the problem encountered when using the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. The user observed that when providing holidays, the `date_range` function produces more than the expected number of periods, leading to unexpected dates in the output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve thorough testing to identify specific scenarios where the `apply` function fails to properly adjust the datetime object according to the custom business hour frequency. Additionally, the calculation of business days, business hours, and adjustments for holidays need to be carefully reviewed and potentially refactored to handle edge cases properly, especially when combined with the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n > 0:
            next_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n > 0:
                if next_start in self.end:
                    n -= 1
                next_start += self.offset
            return next_start
        elif n < 0:
            next_start = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            while n < 0:
                if next_start in self.start:
                    n += 1
                next_start -= self.offset
            return next_start
        else:
            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic of adjusting the datetime object to align with the custom business hour frequency, ensuring that the offset and business hour logic is properly handled. Testing should also be carried out to verify that the adjusted datetime object works as expected when used with the `date_range` function with or without holidays.
