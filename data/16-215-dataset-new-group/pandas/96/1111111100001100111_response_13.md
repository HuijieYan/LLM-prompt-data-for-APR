The bug in the `apply` function appears to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustment based on the business days. In all cases, the variables `bd` and `r` are calculated correctly, but the adjustment to `other` based on these values is not having the intended effect.

Upon inspection, it seems that the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business days and remaining business hours is not correctly implemented. In each case, the adjustment is not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business days and remaining business hours. This can be achieved by adding updated conditional checks and adjusting the logic for selecting the next or previous business time interval.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# other import statements
# ...

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other class functions)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (previous logic up to the calculation of bd and r)

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on CustomBusinessDay
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function, the adjustment logic after the calculation of `bd` and `r` has been updated to ensure that the datetime is properly adjusted based on the business days and remaining business hours. This updated logic should resolve the issues reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the `apply` function works correctly when incorporating holidays and periods.
