The bug in the provided function appears to stem from the logic in the conditional blocks, predominantly in the adjustments made to the 'other' datetime object based on the value of 'n' (number of business hours to adjust). The adjustments to 'other' and the calculations involving 'businesshours' and 'bhour_remain' seem to be leading to incorrect results.

The first issue identified is the incorrect initialization of 'other' as a datetime object, which omits timezone and nanosecond data. Additionally, the adjustments made to 'other' based on whether 'n' is positive or negative, and the subsequent calculations of 'bd' and 'r', are not correctly handling the business hours calculation. Finally, the logic in the while loops to adjust 'bhour_remain' seems to be problematic, resulting in incorrect adjustments to the 'other' datetime object.

To fix the bug, first, we need to ensure that the 'other' datetime object is initialized correctly, preserving the timezone and nanosecond data from the original input 'other'. Then, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting 'other' based on the value of 'n' and calculate 'bd' and 'r' appropriately. Finally, the while loops for adjusting 'bhour_remain' need to be modified to ensure correct adjustment of the 'other' datetime object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Store the original timezone and nanosecond data
        timezone = other.tzinfo
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Calculate the total business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the total minutes in the business hours
        total_minutes = businesshours / 60

        # Calculate bd and r based on n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), total_minutes)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjusting 'other' based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust 'other' to the next opening time if needed
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjust 'other' by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Adjust the remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for positive n
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour = next_closing - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = next_closing
        else:
            # Adjust for negative n
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))

        # Restore the original timezone and nanosecond data to 'other'
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=timezone, nanosecond=nanosecond)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with the original logic and calculations, ensuring that the adjustments to the 'other' datetime object and the business hours calculations are correctly handled.
