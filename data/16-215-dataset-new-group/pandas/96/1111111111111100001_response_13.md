The issue with the given function seems to be with the logic to adjust the timestamp `other` based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. The code incorrectly handles the case when the adjusted timestamp falls on a non-business day. 

The strategy to fix the bug would be to update the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. The code should properly handle cases where the adjusted timestamp falls on a non-business day.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour

# Given function is updated with the corrected logic
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        bus_day = BusinessDay()  # CustomBusinessDay seems to be a subclass of BusinessDay

        if n > 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or other.date() not in bus_day:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() < self.start[0] or other.date() not in bus_day:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - bus_day

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)

        other += bd * bus_day  # Adjust by business days first

        if n > 0:
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_hours < bhour:
                    other += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= bhour
                    other = next_opening
        else:
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if remaining_hours > bhour:
                    other += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

It's important to note that since the actual implementations of `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time` are not provided here, the corrected version of the function might need further adjustments after integrating back with these methods.
