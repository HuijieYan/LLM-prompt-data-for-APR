The issue is occurring because the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is not correctly handling the given holidays when calculating the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This results in an incorrect number of periods being returned by `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

In the buggy function, the issue lies in how the holidays are handled, specifically when adjusting the time for business days, and determining the number of business days to skip. The function doesn't account for the holidays when deciding how many business days to skip.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the holidays when calculating the number of business days to skip.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
        else:
            while other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))

        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version now properly adjusts the `other` variable to skip the holidays when calculating the number of business days to adjust, ensuring that the correct number of periods is returned. With this fix, the failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` should now pass, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
