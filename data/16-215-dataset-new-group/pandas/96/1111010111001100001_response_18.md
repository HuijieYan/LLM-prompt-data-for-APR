The cause of the bug in the function `apply` is due to incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object, leading to incorrect business hours calculations and adjustments.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review and revise the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the values of `n`, `businesshours`, `bd`, and `r` to ensure that it accurately reflects the intended business hours calculation and adjustments.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n == 0:
            return other
        
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        business_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute, self.start[0].second)
        business_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute, self.end[0].second)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= business_end.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= business_start.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._previous_closing_time(other)
        
        delta = timedelta(minutes=n * 60)
        other += delta
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the `other` datetime object is adjusted based on the business start and end times and the value of `n`. This revised approach is intended to ensure accurate calculation and adjustments considering the business hours.
