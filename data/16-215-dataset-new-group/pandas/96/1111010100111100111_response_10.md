The bug in the `apply` function arises from improperly calculating and adjusting the business hours and business days, leading to unexpected results. The function's logic was intended to handle business day offsets and apply business hours to a given date or datetime. However, there are issues with adjusting business days and business hours correctly, as well as with moving to the next business day, which creates the unexpected behavior.

One of the key issues is in the calculation of business hours and days, which results in the incorrect number of days and hours being added or subtracted from the given date.

The bug occurs when calculating the adjusted time of the current business day. This involves detecting the end of the business day and trying to handle off-by-one errors. These issues result in inappropriate adjustments to business hours and days, leading to the unexpected results observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the code logic for adjusting business days and business hours needs to be reviewed and corrected. This includes ensuring accurate handling of conditional statements for both positive and negative offsets, improving the calculation of business days, and properly adjusting the business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function taking into account the identified bug and expected changes:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other based on self.n
            adjusted = self._adjust_business_day_and_hour(other, n)

            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _adjust_business_day_and_hour(self, other, n):
        adjusted = other
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    adjusted = adjusted - timedelta(seconds=1)

                adjusted = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted)
                n += 1

        return adjusted
```

This corrected version of the function provides a logical place for adjust business days and business hours independently, ensuring the correct adjustments are made based on the sign of `self.n`. Additionally, this design allows easier handling of off-by-one errors and ensures deterministic adjustments.
