The buggy function is `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is related to custom business hours and is used to apply the custom business hours to a given datetime object.

The buggy function appears to be causing incorrect behavior for date range generation with custom business hours and holidays, as indicated by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The test generates a date range with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday, but the result does not match the expected output.

The GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" further explains the problem and provides an example where using periods and adding a holiday does not produce the expected result.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified as the sections where adjustments and calculations are made to the `other` datetime object based on the custom business hours and the provided frequency.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the logic in the `apply` function, where the adjustments to the `other` datetime object based on the custom business hours, business days, and remaining business hours are not correctly taking into account the provided holiday.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime object based on the custom business hours. It should ensure that the resulting datetime object is correctly aligned with the expected business hours, considering any holidays that may affect the calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other

            # Adjust for the holiday to get the next business day
            while self.next_bday.holiday_name(other) in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)

            # Adjust other based on business hours
            if self.n > 0:
                while self._is_on_offset(other) or (
                    other.time() not in self.end
                    and not self._is_on_offset(other)
                ):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while other.time() not in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to business hour adjustments and holidays by iterating through the datetime object and adjusting it based on the custom business hours and holidays. This should ensure that the resulting datetime object aligns with the expected business hours, producing the correct output for date range generation with custom business hours and holidays.
