## Analysis
The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to the improper functioning of the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` when used with the `pd.date_range` function and specified holidays. The issue is that when holidays are added, the `periods` parameter in `pd.date_range` does not work as expected and produces more than the specified number of periods.

## Error Locations
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file contains the potential error locations. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and holidays seems to be flawed.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect adjustment of the datetime when specifying holidays. The code logic for adjusting to the next business day, handling business hours, and handling holidays appears to be incorrect, which leads to the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves revising the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays. The datetime adjustment logic needs to be modified to correctly adhere to the specified business hours and holidays, ensuring that the number of periods produced by `date_range` matches the expected output even when holidays are included.

## Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        holiday_dates = getattr(self, "holidays", [])  # Get list of holiday dates
        business_hour_freq = int(getattr(self, "n", 0)) * 60  # Business hours frequency in minutes
        adjusted_datetime = other

        if other.date() in holiday_dates:
            # Adjust to the next business day if the date is a holiday
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(business_hour_freq), 360)
        if business_hour_freq < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            adjusted_datetime += business_day_offset

        # Adjust the remaining business hours
        if business_hour_freq >= 0:
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                business_hour = next_opening - adjusted_datetime
                if remaining_hours < business_hour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    adjusted_datetime += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0
                else:
                    # Go to the next business time interval
                    remaining_hours -= business_hour.total_seconds() / 60
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
        else:
            while remaining_hours < 0:
                previous_opening = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                business_hour = adjusted_datetime - previous_opening
                if remaining_hours > -business_hour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    adjusted_datetime += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0
                else:
                    # Go to the previous business time interval
                    remaining_hours += business_hour.total_seconds() / 60
                    adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(previous_opening)

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays has been revised to correctly handle the specified holidays and produce the expected output when used with `pd.date_range`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
