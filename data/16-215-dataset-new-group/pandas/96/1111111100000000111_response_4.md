### Analysis:
The bug is in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. The function is not correctly handling the adjustment of the `other` time for business hours, leading to incorrect behavior when adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment of the `other` time based on the business hours and holidays.
2. Calculation of business days and remaining business hours and their adjustment.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing incorrect behavior when adjusting business hours with holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. It's likely due to incorrect calculations or adjustments in the `apply` function when adding holidays.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the `other` time based on business hours and handle holidays properly.
2. Review and correct the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ...

    # The corrected apply function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Handle holidays and adjust based on business hours
            business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
            other = self._adjust_for_holidays(other)
            other = self._adjust_for_business_hours(other, business_hours)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _adjust_for_holidays(self, other):
        if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
            other += self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other

    def _adjust_for_business_hours(self, other, business_hours):
        # Adjust the other time based on business hours
        remaining_time = 0
        if self.n >= 0:
            while remaining_time < self.n * business_hours:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    remaining_time += 1
        else:
            while remaining_time > self.n * business_hours:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    remaining_time -= 1

        return other
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function is fixed to accurately handle holidays and adjust the `other` time based on business hours. The adjustments also consider the direction of the adjustment based on the value of `n`.
