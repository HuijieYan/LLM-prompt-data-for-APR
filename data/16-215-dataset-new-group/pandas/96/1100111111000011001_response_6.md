The buggy function has issues with the handling of business hours in the datetime method. To fix this, we need to update the logic for adjusting business hours and validate the data.

I have fixed the buggy function as follows:

```python
from functools import wraps

# other functions remain unchanged

def apply_wraps(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if (
                    other.time() in self.end
                    or not self._is_on_offset(other)
                ):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    return wrapper
```

The above fix applies a wrapper to the `apply` function, which ensures that the `other` parameter is a datetime and then performs the necessary logic to adjust business hours.

This fix should resolve the issues with the original buggy function and pass the failing test.
