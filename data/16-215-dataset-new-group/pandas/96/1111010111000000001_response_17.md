The buggy function `apply` is a method of the class `BusinessHourMixin` which takes an input `other` and performs a series of calculations to adjust the business hours based on the input datetime. The buggy function is intended to work with custom business hours, but it fails to produce the correct adjusted datetime in certain cases, as demonstrated by the failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, as well as the calculations for moving to the next business time interval.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustments made to the datetime for custom business hours are not correctly handling the case when the business day falls on a holiday, resulting in incorrect adjustments and ultimately failing the test.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the adjustments consider holidays when calculating the business days and remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (other code remains unchanged)

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # ... (other code remains unchanged)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we added conditionals to handle the case when the adjusted datetime falls on a holiday, ensuring that the adjustments are accurate and correctly handle holidays. This should allow the function to pass the failing test and work as intended for custom business hours.
