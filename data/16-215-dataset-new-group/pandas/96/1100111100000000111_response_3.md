The buggy function seems to be in charge of adjusting the input datetime object based on the business hours and holidays associated with it. The bug may be related to the logic of adjusting dates and times based on business hours and holidays. The GitHub issue suggests that the `pd.date_range` function produces unexpected results when holidays are added, specifically generating more than the expected number of periods.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. The buggy function uses conditional statements to adjust the input datetime based on whether the number of business hours is positive or negative. There might be issues with these conditional statements and the calculation of remaining business hours.

Based on this analysis, a suggested strategy for fixing the bug in the function could be to review and potentially refactor the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and holidays. This may involve debugging the conditional statements and the calculation of remaining business hours to ensure that the adjustment logic is correctly handling both positive and negative business hour cases in the presence of holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if isinstance(n, int) and n != 0:
            raise ValueError("n must be an integer and not equal to zero")
        
        # Adjust the datetime to remove timezone and nanoseconds
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        
        if n >= 0:
            # Check if the input datetime is on the offset
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Business hours calculation
        business_hours_minutes = [(en - st).seconds/60 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)]
        business_hours = sum(business_hours_minutes)
        
        # Initial calculations for business days and remaining hours
        remainder, hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours)
        if n < 0:
            remainder, hours = -remainder, -hours
            
        # Adjust by business days first
        if remainder != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=remainder)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=hours)
        
        # Loop for adjusting remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            next_interval = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)
            bhour = (next_interval - other).seconds // 60
            if bhour_remain >= timedelta(minutes=bhour):
                other = next_interval
                bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=bhour)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function includes additional error checking and refactored logic to more accurately adjust the input datetime based on business hours and holidays. This revised logic should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.
