The buggy function `apply` is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to produce incorrect output. This is evident from the error message, which indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the test. The buggy function `apply` attempts to adjust a given datetime according to custom business hours, but the adjustments result in an incorrect output.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the misalignment of business hours with the custom business hours and possibly the handling of holidays. Specifically, the adjustment of business days and business hours in the `apply` function is not producing the correct result, leading to unexpected output in the test case.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and revising the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours. Additionally, the handling of holidays needs to be considered to ensure that the adjustments in the function are compatible with holidays.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            if self.n > 0:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return self._prev_opening_time(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours. It directly checks if the datetime is on the business offset, and if not, it adjusts the datetime to the next or previous opening time. This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
