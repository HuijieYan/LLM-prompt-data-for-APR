Based on the given information, I will analyze the buggy function and the failing test, identify potential error locations, explain the bug's cause, and suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

### Analysis
The buggy function, `apply`, is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, and it applies business hour offsets to a given datetime. It includes multiple calculations to adjust the datetime based on business hours, business days, and other criteria. The failing test, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, aims to create a date range using custom business hours and holidays. The function takes a datetime as input and adjusts it based on the specified business hours and days.

### Identified Error Locations
1. In the `while` loop for adjusting remaining business hours, the conditions for comparing timedelta objects are flawed.
2. The adjustment with `skip_bd` (CustomBusinessDay) doesn't consider business hour details or whether the time is within business hours.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug is primarily caused by the flawed logic for adjusting business hours and days. The failing test is attempting to create a date range using custom business hours and holidays, but the buggy function does not handle the adjustments properly. This leads to incorrect datetime outputs, as seen in the failing test's expected vs. actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic for adjusting remaining business hours in the while loop to ensure correct comparisons and adjustments.
2. Improve the handling of CustomBusinessDay adjustments to consider business hour details and verify if the time falls within business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # existing code remains unchanged ...
        # ...
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            # modify the logic to adjust based on business hours
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                # adjust based on specific business hours
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(minutes=1))
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # modify the adjustment logic to ensure consistent comparisons and adjustments
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the flawed comparisons and adjustments in the while loops and modifies the logic for adjusting based on business days to consider business hour details. Applying these changes should resolve the issue reported in the failing test case.
