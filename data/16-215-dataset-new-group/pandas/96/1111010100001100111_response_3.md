The issue with the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be related to the manipulation of datetime values within business hours. This is causing unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The issue appears to be with the logic that adjusts the datetime value to the next business time interval. When adjusting the datetime value, the function is not handling the case of transitioning to a new business day correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic related to the adjustment of the datetime value within the `apply` function. Specifically, pay attention to the part where the adjustments are made based on the total business hours and the adjustment by business days.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Adjust for business days
        if n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            num_skipped_days = 0
            while num_skipped_days < n:
                if self._next_opening_time(other) - other < timedelta(0):
                    num_skipped_days += 1
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            num_skipped_days = 0
            while num_skipped_days > n:
                if other - self._prev_opening_time(other) < timedelta(0):
                    num_skipped_days -= 1
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        remaining_secs = n * 60 * businesshours
        delta = timedelta(seconds=remaining_secs)
        other += delta

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:

- The adjustment for business days is handled with a loop that counts the number of skipped days according to the required shift (`n`).
- The adjustment for remaining business hours is calculated directly using the total business hours and the required shift.

With these adjustments, the `apply` function should behave correctly and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
