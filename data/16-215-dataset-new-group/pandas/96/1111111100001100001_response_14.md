The buggy function seems to be improperly adjusting the input datetime value according to business hours and days (e.g., opening and closing times, skipping holidays, and adjusting business hours).

The potential causes of the bug are:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input datetime in the case where `self.n >= 0`.
2. Incorrect adjustments of business days and remaining business hours for negative values of `self.n`.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the input datetime should be done carefully considering the different cases of business hours and days, especially when `self.n` is negative.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond,
            tzinfo=None,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end[0] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjusting input datetime based on business days
        if n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
            else:  # For negative n
                adjustment = BusinessDay(n=n)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other - adjustment

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if bhour <= timedelta(minutes=r):
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    other = next_opening
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    break
        else:
            while r < 0:
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = other - prev_opening
                if bhour.seconds // 60 >= abs(r):
                    other = prev_opening
                    r += bhour.seconds // 60
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                    break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the flawed adjustments and edge cases related to business days and business hours. It also improves the handling of the input datetime when adjusting for business days.

Make sure to replace the buggy function with the above corrected version in the relevant file. After making this change, re-test the cases to verify the fix.
