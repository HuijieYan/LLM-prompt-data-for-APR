The issue is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, which does not handle holidays correctly and produces an incorrect number of periods when used in `pd.date_range()`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the blocks of code that handle the adjustments to the specified date and time based on business hours and holidays.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function does not correctly handle holidays. The code is using the `apply` function to adjust the given dates based on business hours, but the adjustments do not account for holidays, causing the `pd.date_range()` function to produce more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function should be updated to handle holidays properly and adjust the date and time accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # The corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Handling logic for holidays
            other = self.handle_holidays(other)

            # Rest of the adjustment logic
            ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def handle_holidays(self, other):
        holidays = self.holidays
        if other.date() in holidays:
            # Adjust other to the next business day after the holiday
            other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
        return other
```

By introducing a new method called `handle_holidays`, we isolate the logic for handling holidays, which will now properly adjust the given date if it falls on a holiday.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `pd.date_range()` function works correctly with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, even when holidays are specified as input.

Note: Additional testing should be conducted to ensure that the corrected function works as expected across a range of inputs and edge cases.
