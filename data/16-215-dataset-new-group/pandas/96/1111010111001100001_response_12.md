From the failing test, it seems that the apply function of the BusinessHourMixin class in the offsets.py file of the pandas library is failing. The failing test is related to custom business hours and holidays.

After analyzing the buggy function's runtime input/output values, it appears that the problematic areas within the buggy function include the adjustment of dates and times, calculations for business hours, and business day adjustments.

The given buggy function is failing to handle the adjustments related to custom business hours and holidays, causing it to produce incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we will need to make adjustments to the logic for handling custom business hours and holidays, as well as the calculations for business hours and business day adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function, with the necessary adjustments:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Remove any timezone information
            n = self.n

            # Adjust for custom holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                business_day = CustomBusinessDay(n=1, start=self.start, end=self.end, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
                if n > 0:
                    other = other + business_day
                else:
                    other = other - business_day

            # Adjust for custom business hours
            business_hours = self._get_business_hours(other)
            new_time = other.time()

            # Check if the current time is outside of business hours
            if new_time < self.start:
                other = datetime.combine(other, self.start)
            elif new_time >= self.end:
                other = datetime.combine(other, self.start) + timedelta(days=1)

            # Calculate the number of business hours to skip
            business_hours_to_skip = n * business_hours

            # Skip the specified number of business hours
            while business_hours_to_skip:
                new_time = other.time()
                if new_time < self.start:
                    other = datetime.combine(other, self.start)
                elif new_time >= self.end:
                    other = datetime.combine(other, self.start) + timedelta(days=1)
                elif self.end <= new_time < self.start:
                    other = datetime.combine(other, self.start)
                else:
                    if n > 0:
                        other += timedelta(hours=1)
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(hours=1)

                business_hours_to_skip -= 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the buggy function should now pass the failing test.
