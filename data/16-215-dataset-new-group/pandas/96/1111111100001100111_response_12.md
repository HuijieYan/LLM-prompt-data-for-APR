The `apply` function has a bug that causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected when holidays are added to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. Based on the runtime input/output values and types, and the GitHub issue description, it seems that the bug is related to the custom business hours not being handled correctly when holidays are involved.

The cause of the bug is a flaw in the adjustment of business days using the `BusinessDay` when modifying the `other` parameter. The logic does not handle holidays and other edge conditions properly, leading to an incorrect adjustment of the datetime values.

To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic for adjusting business days to make sure that holidays and edge cases are properly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Get the total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Adjust the other parameter based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Handle holidays and edge conditions in the adjustment
        offset = 0
        while offset < abs(n) - 1:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            offset += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of business days has been revised to properly handle holidays and edge conditions. The logic ensures that the datetime adjustments are performed accurately based on the holiday schedule and the value of `n`, preventing unnecessary periods from being added to the `pd.date_range` output.
