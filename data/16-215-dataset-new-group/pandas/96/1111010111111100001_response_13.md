The bug is caused by an infinite loop in the code, which results in an incorrect computation of the date and time. The issue is related to the adjustment of the time to reduce the number of cases to handle, as it does not handle negative business hours correctly and fails to account for midday transitions. 

To fix the bug, you should revise the conditional statements and loops to ensure that the adjustments are correctly made for both positive and negative business hours. Additionally, handle the cases where skip business days are involved in the adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get the total business hours by second in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the function should now handle all the edge cases and return the correct values, passing the failing tests.
