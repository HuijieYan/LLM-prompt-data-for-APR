The buggy function `apply` attempts to apply a custom business hour frequency on a datetime using the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the failing test. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

### Analysis:
1. The `apply` function attempts to adjust the input date based on a custom business hour, but there is a problem with the adjustment logic.

2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` attempts to use the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency, but the resulting index does not match the expected index due to the issue in the `apply` function.

3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` that occurs inside the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class as a result of the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the logic for adjusting the input date in the `apply` function when dealing with negative values of business days. The adjustment logic for negative values may be incorrect, leading to the generation of an index that does not conform to the expected frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug:
1. The logic in the `apply` function related to the adjustment of dates for negative business days should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the adjustment produces the correct output for all scenarios.
2. Special attention should be given to the cases where the number of business days is negative, as this is where the bug is suspected to originate from.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary classes from pandas library
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessDay, BusinessHourMixin
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Corrected version of the buggy 'apply' function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        freq = self.freq
        if self.n >= 0:
            other += pd.Timedelta(n * (freq.after_freq + freq.before_freq), unit="D")
        else:
            other += pd.Timedelta(n * (freq.after_freq + freq.before_freq), unit="D") - pd.Timedelta(-1, unit="ns")
 
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments are made based on the specific attributes of the custom business hour frequency and a check for negative business days. This approach aims to address the faulty logic that caused the failing test.
