The issue described in the failing test and GitHub issue is related to the `pd.date_range` function not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays. The output of the `pd.date_range` function with holidays is producing more than the specified number of periods, which indicates that there is an error in handling holidays within the `pd.date_range` function.

The identified location for the source of the bug is the implementation of the `apply` function inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The `apply` function is responsible for calculating the adjusted datetime based on custom business hours, but it seems to be incorrectly adjusting for holidays, which leads to the erroneous output in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function. The function is not properly accounting for holidays when calculating the adjusted datetime, causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime based on holidays, ensuring that the `pd.date_range` function behaves as expected when adding holidays to custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
        # (the rest of the code remains unchanged)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we've added a condition to account for holidays within the `apply` function. If the input datetime `other` matches any of the holidays specified in `self.holidays`, it will be adjusted to the next opening time, ensuring that the adjusted datetime respects the specified holidays.

By making this modification, the corrected `apply` function should ensure that the `pd.date_range` function works as expected when using periods and adding holidays, addressing the issue described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
