The bug seems to be related to the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is used in combination with `pd.date_range` to generate periods based on a CustomBusinessHour frequency offset. The error occurs when a holiday is provided, and the resulting period count is incorrect.

Looking at the function, it appears that there's an issue with adjusting the frequency when holidays are present. The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for handling holidays and adjusting the frequency to account for them.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling holidays needs to be reviewed and adjusted in the `apply` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing methods ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Existing logic ...

            # New logic to handle holidays
            if self.holidays is not None:
                for holiday in self.holidays:
                    if other.date() == holiday.date():
                        if n >= 0:
                            other = other + timedelta(days=1)
                            while CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).is_on_offset(other):
                                other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                        else:
                            other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                            while CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).is_on_offset(other):
                                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
                        break

            # Remaining existing logic ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, when a holiday is encountered, it adjusts the `other` datetime object based on the holiday and the direction of the business hours. This should resolve the issue of incorrect period counts when using `pd.date_range` with a CustomBusinessHour and holidays.

Please note this code correction is a hypothesis and may not be the final solution. It is advisable to run further tests to ensure that this modification addresses the issue as described in GitHub.
