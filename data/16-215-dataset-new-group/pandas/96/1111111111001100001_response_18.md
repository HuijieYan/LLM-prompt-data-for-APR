The cause of the bug is that the business hour adjustment algorithm inside the `apply` method is not handling the cases for adjusting the time correctly. The function is overcomplicating the logic and leading to incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, we need to simplify the logic for adjusting the business hours in both positive and negative scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other_time = other.time()

            if n >= 0:
                if other_time >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other_time <= self.start[0]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this simplified logic, the corrected `apply` method should now handle the adjustments correctly and pass the failing tests.
