It is clear from the buggy function's implementation that this is a method within a class and that it is supposed to return a `datetime` object.

The potential errors in the function include incorrectly handling edge cases, incorrect handling of business hours, and incorrect adjustments when reducing the number of days to handle.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect date and time adjustments in the function. Specifically, there can be issues in the logic used to adjust the business hours, calculate the remaining business hours after adjusting by days, and adjusting the business hours in each business time interval.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business hours, calculating the remaining business hours, and adjusting the business hours in each business time interval should be carefully reviewed and corrected.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if self.n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif self.n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if self.n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculations for business hours
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days 
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if self.n >= 0:
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other += skip_bd
                else:
                    other -= skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if self.n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in adjusting the business hours and calculating the remaining hours. It also takes care of adjusting the business days before calculating the remaining hours. This should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the function.
