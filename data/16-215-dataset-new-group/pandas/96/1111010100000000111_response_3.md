The bug in the `apply` function is causing unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function. The function is not properly handling holidays, resulting in more periods than specified.

The bug seems to be related to the way the `apply` function handles holidays within the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. It is not correctly adjusting for holidays, leading to incorrect period generation in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays and adjust the periods accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # rest of the function remains unchanged
            # ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

In the corrected version, we included an additional check for holidays in the `apply` function. If the date falls under the list of holidays, adjustments are made accordingly to handle the periods properly.

This should help resolve the issue experienced with the `pd.date_range` function and the unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays.
