The issue posted on GitHub suggests that the `pd.date_range` function produces an unexpected output when using periods and adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency. Instead of the expected 14 periods, the output contains more periods with unexpected dates. The user has noted that replacing the periods with the corresponding end produces the correct output.

The runtime input/output values provided indicate that the buggy function is failing to adjust the date correctly based on the specified business hours and holidays. In each case, the values of `other` and related variables show signs of misalignment with the expected business hours and holiday adjustments.

It seems that the buggy function is not efficiently handling the adjustment of dates based on the custom business hour frequency, particularly when it encounters holidays, leading to the unexpected behavior reported by the user. Additionally, the loop representing remaining business hours and adjustments seems to be functioning incorrectly based on the provided values.

To fix the bug, the algorithm needs to be revised to ensure the correct handling of business hours, holiday adjustments, and remaining adjustments based on the custom business hours frequency.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        business_day = BusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays)
        adjusted_date = other

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(other if n > 0 else adjusted_date)
                n -= 1
            else:
                adjusted_date = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_date)
                n += 1
        
        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function iteratively adjusts the date based on the custom business hours frequency, considering holidays and the sign of the adjustment. This approach aims to ensure the correct adjustment of business days, holiday offsets, and remaining business hours.
