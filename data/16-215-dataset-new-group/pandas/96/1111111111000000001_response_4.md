Based on the given code for the buggy function and the failing test, it seems like the issue lies in the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of time based on business days. The failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" uses the "pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour" function to calculate a date range, and the expected result does not match the actual result due to incorrect business hour calculations.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the calculation logic for business hours and adjustments to ensure that it accurately handles the business day logic and time intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_day_start_time = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute
            )
            business_day_end_time = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute
            )

            # If the given time is after the business day end time or not on offset, adjust to the next opening time
            if other > business_day_end_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                while True:
                    if other < business_day_end_time:
                        break
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                while True:
                    if other > business_day_start_time:
                        break
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the function includes the following changes:
- The calculation of the business day start and end times is simplified.
- The adjustment logic is modified to correctly handle the cases where the given time is after the business day end time or before the business day start time.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays".
