The bug in the `apply` function is causing an unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when used with periods and holidays. It is producing more periods than expected when holidays are added. The bug seems to be with the logic for adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the logic for adjusting the dates based on business hours and holidays. The `apply` function has a complex logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the defined business hours and holidays. The calculation of business hours, the adjustment of dates, and the handling of edge cases seem to be the potential error locations. This is evident from the unexpected behavior observed in the runtime input-output values.

To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the logic for adjusting the dates based on business hours and holidays should be reviewed and simplified. Additionally, the logic for checking holidays and adjusting the dates needs to be thoroughly reviewed. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a business hour
        if other.hour < self.start.hour or (other.hour == self.start.hour and other.minute < self.start.minute):
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute, 0)

        # Check if other is a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self.next_bday._next_business_day(other)

        # Calculate the adjusted date based on business hours
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
        if self.n >= 0:
            # Adjust for positive n
            delta = timedelta(seconds=((business_hours * self.n * 60) / 60))
            other += delta
        else:
            # Adjust for negative n
            delta = timedelta(seconds=((business_hours * self.n * 60) / 60))
            other -= delta

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the dates has been simplified and does not contain redundant conditions and functions. It first checks if `other` is a business hour, then checks if it's a holiday, and then proceeds to adjust the date based on the business hours and the specified `n` value.

This should resolve the unexpected behavior observed with the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays.

Note: This corrected version assumes that the corrected logic aligns with the intended behavior of the `apply` function. If further adjustments are needed to align with specific business rules, additional review and testing may be necessary.
