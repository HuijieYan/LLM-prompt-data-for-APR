### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The error seems to be related to the way the `apply` function is handling the business hours and holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated by `pd.date_range`.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information.
The error message indicates a discrepancy between the expected number of periods and the actual number of periods generated by `pd.date_range`. This is related to the `apply` function, particularly its handling of holidays and adjustments to the datetime input.

The GitHub issue further confirms that when adding holidays, the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` no longer matches the expected output.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic in the `apply` function that computes the number of periods and adjust it to properly handle holidays and business hours while generating the date range.

### Provide a corrected version of the function.
```python
# Import existing libraries
# ...

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Previous code...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # previous processing logic...
            
            # Introduce holiday check
            if self._is_holiday(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            # Adjust remaining business hours for holidays
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other - bhour)
                        )
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for holidays and adjusted the remaining business hours based on the holiday and business hour intervals. This revised logic should properly handle the holidays and generate the correct number of periods when calling `pd.date_range`.
