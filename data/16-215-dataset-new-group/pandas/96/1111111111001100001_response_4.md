### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is not handling the business hours correctly when adjusting the datetime. It is using conditionals and calculations that do not accurately adjust the time according to business hours. As a result, the function returns incorrect values for the datetime. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be rewritten to accurately adjust the datetime according to business hours, taking into account the start and end times, as well as any holidays or weekends.

### Corrected Code
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            business_hours_start = min(self.start)
            business_hours_end = max(self.end)
            delta_to_start = (business_hours_start - other).total_seconds()
            delta_to_end = (other - business_hours_end).total_seconds()
            delta_to_weekend = 0
            while delta_to_end > 0:
                if other.weekday() == 4:
                    delta_to_weekend += 2 * 24*60*60
                else:
                    delta_to_weekend += (4-other.weekday()) * 24*60*60
                other += timedelta(days=4-other.weekday())
