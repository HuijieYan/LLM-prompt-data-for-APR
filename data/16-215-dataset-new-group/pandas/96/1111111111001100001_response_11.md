The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to calculate business hours based on a given timestamp and the current business hours. The function seems to have a number of issues, including potential incorrect calculations and deviations from the expected behavior. Based on the failing test, the function is not correctly calculating the next business day and applying business hours correctly. 

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and the buggy function, it is evident that the function is not handling business days and business hours as expected. The calculations for adjusting the input timestamp do not seem to be working correctly for both positive and negative 'n' values, which is causing the inaccuracies in the return values.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Ensure that the conditions for positive and negative 'n' values are correctly handled to adjust the timestamp for the next business day and remaining business hours.
2. Evaluate the logic for adjusting business hours and ensure it accurately applies the business duration to the timestamp.
3. Verify the conditions to check if a specific timestamp is on a business offset.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# import statements keep the same

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # existing function definitions here
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:  # changed comparison to include equal condition
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjust_time = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        other = self._get_closing_time(adjust_time)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function aims to address the issues found in the original function and should now pass the failing test.
