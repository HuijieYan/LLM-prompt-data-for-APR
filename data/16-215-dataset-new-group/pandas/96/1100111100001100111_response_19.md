The bug in the `apply` function appears to be related to the adjustment of business hours. Specifically, when adjusting the business hours to reduce the number of cases to handle, there is an issue when the number is greater than or equal to 0. Based on the provided runtime values and the GitHub issue, it seems that this adjustment is not working as expected, resulting in unexpected output.

The bug seems to be stemming from the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function. There are multiple if-else conditions handling the adjustment based on the value of `n`. Incorrect handling of these conditions could result in the unexpected return from the function as observed in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the other to reduce the number of cases should be reviewed and potentially revised. Particularly, the conditions based on the value of `n` need to be carefully examined to ensure that the adjustment is being performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if bd != 0 and not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version makes changes to the adjustment logic based on the value of `n`, ensuring that the adjustment is performed correctly, and is based on the observed behavior from the failing tests and the described issue.

With this corrected logic, the function should now properly adjust the time according to the specified business hours and the value of `n`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

As a final step, once the corrected function is validated, it should be contributed back to the Pandas repository.
