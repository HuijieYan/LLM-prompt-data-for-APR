The issue with the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be related to unexpected output values when working with `date_range` and custom business hours that include holidays. The error message suggests that the date range does not work as expected when adding a holiday, leading to an output that differs from the expected number of periods.

The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is likely related to the logic for adjusting the datetime values within the custom business hours. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime values in the `apply` function and ensuring that the adjustments are consistent with the expected behavior of the custom business hours, especially when holidays are involved.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues listed in the failing test cases and align the behavior with the expected outputs. Due to the absence of the full implementation details and the specifics of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, the above correction provides a basic outline for addressing the issue. Further testing and integration within the `BusinessHourMixin` class might be needed to ensure the correct behavior.
