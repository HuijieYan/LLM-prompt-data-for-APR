The buggy function contains a number of large and complex conditional statements that can lead to bugs and hard-to-find issues. It's prone to errors based on the inputs and possibly introduces bugs due to its complexity. The function receives a datetime object as input and performs a series of calculations and time adjustments, based on a series of conditional statements, before returning the modified datetime object. 

The potential error locations are in the series of conditional statements that involve time calculations, adjustments, and comparisons.

There are also multiple references to other functions and methods like `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `is_on_offset`. Any issues in these referenced functions may also cause unpredictable behavior in the buggy function.

To effectively debug and fix this function, it is recommended to break down the large conditional statements and implement unit tests for each unit of the functionality. Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of the expected behavior of the function is necessary in order to thoroughly test and validate its correctness.

Here is a corrected version of the function based on the expected input/output values:
