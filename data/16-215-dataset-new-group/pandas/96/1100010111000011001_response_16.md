The code contains an issue related to the logic of skipping a business day that results in the incorrect output. After analyzing the code and the failing test, it seems that the issue resides in the `apply` function, specifically in the `skip_bd` section. The logic for skipping business days needs to be adjusted to align with the expected output.

To resolve the bug:
- The `skip_bd` variable should be set with the correct value based on the business day calculations.
- Adjust the logic to consider the correct calculation in various scenarios when arriving at the next business day.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Existing code remains unchanged

        # adjust by business days first
        adjusted_other = other
        if self.n > 0:
            # Calculate business days to be skipped and change the adjusted_other value
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=self.n)
            adjusted_other = adjusted_other + skip_bd
        else:
            # When self.n is less than 0, subtract the business days
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=self.n)
            adjusted_other = adjusted_other - skip_bd

        # Existing code remains unchanged

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the `apply` function should produce the correct output for the failing test cases.
