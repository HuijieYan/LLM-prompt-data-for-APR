The buggy function `apply` in the pandas library is causing issues with the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays. The function is located in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.

The issue seems to stem from the calculation within the `apply` function, which results in unexpected output when combined with the `date_range` function.

The problem can be attributed to the calculations within the `apply` method, specifically when adjusting the timestamps based on business days and business hours. This causes the unexpected output, adding extra periods to the date range when holidays are involved.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be updated to properly calculate and adjust the timestamps based on business hours and holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (datetime, np.datetime64)):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = np.datetime64('NaT')

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for business hours and holidays
            for i in range(n):
                adjusted_time = pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
                    start=self.start,
                    end=self.end,
                    holidays=self.holidays
                ).apply(other + pd.Timedelta(i, 'D'))
                if adjusted_time.month == other.month:
                    break
        else:
            # Adjust for negative business hours and holidays
            for i in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_time = pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
                    start=self.start,
                    end=self.end,
                    holidays=self.holidays
                ).apply(other - pd.Timedelta(i, 'D'))
                if adjusted_time.month == other.month:
                    break

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Add the corrected function to the library
CustomBusinessHour.apply = apply
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue should be resolved, and the function should work as expected with the `date_range` function.
