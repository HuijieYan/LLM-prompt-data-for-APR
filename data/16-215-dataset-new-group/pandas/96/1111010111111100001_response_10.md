Based on the analysis, the bug in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing incorrect behavior, leading to failures in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test. The root cause of the bug is related to the incorrect application of CustomBusinessHour frequency, which is not being handled properly in the `apply` method.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to resolve the issues related to offset calculation and business hour adjustment within the `apply` method.
2. Correct the logic related to adjusting the business day and remaining business hours.
3. Handle the CustomBusinessHour start hour, holidays, and business day adjustments appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other to the next opening time if the timestamp is outside business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.hour not in range(self.start[0].hour, self.end[0].hour) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.hour < self.start[0].hour:
                # Adjust to the previous business day end
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            elif other.hour > self.end[0].hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate business hours
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), (business_hours // 60))
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours
        
        if business_days != 0:
            other += pd.DateOffset(days=business_days)
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if remaining_hours != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_hours > 0:
                    business_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if remaining_hours < business_hour.seconds // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= business_hour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + pd.DateOffset(days=1)
            else:
                while remaining_hours < 0:
                    business_hour = other - self._get_closing_time(self._prev_closing_time(other))
                    if abs(remaining_hours) < business_hour.seconds // 60:
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(remaining_hours))
                        remaining_hours = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_hours += business_hour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + pd.DateOffset(days=-1)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected code handles the adjustment of business hours and business days to accurately apply the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

By replacing the buggy `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class with the corrected version, the failing test should pass successfully.
