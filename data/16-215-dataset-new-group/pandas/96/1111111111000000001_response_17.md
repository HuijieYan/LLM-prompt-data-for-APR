The buggy function applies a custom business hour frequency with a start time of "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26" to a date range. The expected output is a date range with four periods, skipping the holiday and adjusting the business hours accordingly. However, the buggy function is not handling the holiday correctly and is not adjusting the business hours as expected, causing the failing test to fail.

The buggy function seems to be not handling holidays and business hours adjustments correctly, leading to incorrect output for the given test case. To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays and adjust business hours based on the specified frequency.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the date is a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            # adjust to the next business day
            other = self.next_bday(other)
        
        # Reset time to start of business hours
        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)

        # Increment by one hour if the time is within business hours
        if self.start <= other.time() < self.end:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
        
        # Adjust to the next business day if time is after business hours
        if other.time() >= self.end:
            other = self.next_bday(other)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the date is a holiday, and if so, adjust it to the next business day. Then, we reset the time to the start of business hours and increment by one hour if the time is within business hours. If the time is after business hours, we again adjust it to the next business day and reset the time to the start of business hours.

This corrected version should address the issues with handling holidays and adjusting business hours, ensuring that the function passes the failing test.
