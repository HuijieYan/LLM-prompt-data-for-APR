The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrectly adjusting the given timestamp `other` based on the business hour and the frequency `n`. The bug causes the function to produce incorrect timestamps when applying business hours. 

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. This occurs when adding or subtracting the next business time interval and handling the remaining business hours, often leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly adjusts timestamps based on the business hour and frequency without discrepancies.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not self.on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if self.n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours_by_sec = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours_by_sec // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            while not self.next_bday.on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying these corrections, we can resolve the issue and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test.
