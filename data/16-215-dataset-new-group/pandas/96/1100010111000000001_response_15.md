The buggy function is `apply` in the pandas `tseries/offsets.py` file. It is failing the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file.

The potential error locations within the `apply` function are where it handles the adjustment of business days and the adjustment of remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function is not properly adjusting the business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect results in the test. The adjustments for business days and business hours are not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours based on the input provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if r != 0:
            roll = self.roll('r')
            other = roll.apply(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with adjusting business days and remaining business hours. With these changes, the `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
