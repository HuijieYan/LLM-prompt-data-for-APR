The buggy function `apply` is causing an error when trying to run the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The function is supposed to manipulate the input datetime, adjusting it for business days and business hours, but it's failing to do so correctly.

The bug is likely to be caused by incorrect manipulation of the datetime object within the `apply` function, leading to unexpected offsets and resulting in a failure in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime to business days and business hours within the `apply` function is correctly implemented. Additionally, we need to make sure that the CustomBusinessHour offset is being properly handled and applied to the datetime objects.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            hour = self.start.hour
            minute = self.start.minute
            adjusted = pd.Timestamp(other)
            adjusted = adjusted.replace(hour=hour, minute=minute) if adjusted.time() < self.start else adjusted.replace(hour=hour, minute=minute) + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
            shift = pd.Timedelta(hours=adjusted.hour - hour, minutes=adjusted.minute - minute, seconds=adjusted.second)
            if n >= 0:
                adjusted = adjusted + shift * int(n)
            else:
                adjusted = adjusted - shift * int(abs(n))
            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function above should address the issue, ensuring that the CustomBusinessHour is handled correctly and applied to the datetime objects as intended.
