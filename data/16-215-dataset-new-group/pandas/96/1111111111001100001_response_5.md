The bug in the function appears to be related to the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the input `other` and `self` parameters. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the cases where `n` is negative and certain conditions related to the business hours themselves. The cases provided in the test function and the resulting values from running the failing tests have been analyzed to understand the cause of the bug.

The bug occurs when the function tries to adjust the business hours based on the input `other` and `self` parameters. The logic for adjusting the business hours based on the `n` parameter (which represents the number of business hours to adjust) is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect outputs.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review and update the logic for adjusting the business hours. This may involve identifying the incorrect branching conditions within the `if` statements, revisiting the calculations for business day adjustments, and ensuring that the operation of adding or subtracting business hours is correctly applied based on the input `n`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Business day adjustments
            if n != 0:
                new_date = other
                while n > 0:
                    new_date = self.next_bday(new_date)
                    n -= 1
                while n < 0:
                    new_date = self.prev_bday(new_date)
                    n += 1
                other = datetime(
                    new_date.year,
                    new_date.month,
                    new_date.day,
                    other.hour,
                    other.minute,
                    other.second,
                    other.microsecond,
                )

            # Adjusting business hours
            adjusted_hours = timedelta(minutes=self.business_hours * abs(n))
            if n < 0:
                adjusted_hours = -adjusted_hours

            other += adjusted_hours

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test. Don't forget to ensure that the referenced methods like `self.next_bday()`, `self.prev_bday()`, and `self.business_hours` are correctly implemented elsewhere in the class.
