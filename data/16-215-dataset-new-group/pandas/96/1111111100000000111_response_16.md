The buggy function is part of the `pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub relates to unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when using the `periods` parameter and adding holidays. The provided code works fine for generating the date range with custom business hour frequency and no holidays, but when holidays are added, it produces more dates than specified in the periods.

The cause of the issue could be a flaw in the logic of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, as this function is responsible for adjusting the business hours based on the specified parameters and is utilized by the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The bug may be causing incorrect calculations when holidays are involved, leading to the unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, you need to review the logic in the `apply` function and ensure that the calculations for adjusting business hours with holidays are handled accurately.

Now, I'll provide a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                other += bd * BDay()
    
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if r <= bhour.seconds // 60 or nanosecond != 0:
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")    
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `other` datetime is adjusted based on the start time of the business hours.
2. Business days are handled using `pandas.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` to ensure correct adjustment when applying business days.
3. The remaining business hours are adjusted based on the calculated time intervals.

By making these adjustments, the logic for applying business hours and handling holidays should be more accurate and aligned with the expected behavior of `pd.date_range`.
