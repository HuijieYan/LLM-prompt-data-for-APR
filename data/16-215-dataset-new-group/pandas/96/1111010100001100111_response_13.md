The bug in the `apply` function is likely caused due to the incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours. This results in unexpected output when adding a holiday to the frequency.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it appears that the calculation involving `bd` and `bhour_remain` leads to incorrect results. The logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours might be flawed, leading to the unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. It's also important to consider the handling of holidays in the calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (remaining code)
    
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to previous business time interval
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for remaining business hours have been revised to ensure the correct time intervals are considered, and the handling of negative business hours (for previous business days) has been updated accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the `apply` function should now produce the expected output, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
