The buggy function consists of a complex algorithm for business hour calculation, including conditionals and loops. It appears to be related to determining business hours and adjusting time based on a custom business hour frequency.

The bug might be caused by the mishandling of time adjustments and increments within the algorithm, leading to incorrect results and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the logic that adjusts the datetime based on the given custom business hour frequency.
2. Check the conditions for handling positive and negative business hour adjustments.
3. Ensure that the adjustments and calculations are correctly reflecting the custom business hour frequency provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n > 0:  # Adjust by business days first
            other += self.next_bday
            n -= 1
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n < 0:
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open - self.next_bday
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + remain
            n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised version aims to improve the logic and adjustments for business hour calculations, ensuring that the adjustments are correctly made according to the custom business hour frequency. After applying these modifications, the function should pass the failing test while also handling various business hour adjustment scenarios.
