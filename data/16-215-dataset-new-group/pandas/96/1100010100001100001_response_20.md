The buggy function applies business hour offset to a given datetime, considering the opening and closing times of the business hours. The function seems to be incorrectly calculating the business day and remaining business hours to adjust, leading to incorrect output.

The bugs in the function are related to the calculation of business days and remaining business hours to adjust, which affects the final result. It is causing the function to return incorrect datetime values, and this can be observed in the runtime variable values right before the function's return.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating business days and remaining business hours needs to be corrected. Additionally, the logic for checking the current time against the business hours start and end times also needs to be reviewed. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += self.offset
                if other.isoweekday() in (6, 7) or other in self.holidays:
                    continue
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= self.offset
                if other.isoweekday() in (6, 7) or other in self.holidays:
                    continue
                n += 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the business days and hours are adjusted using a simple while loop that applies the business hour offset to the input datetime while considering weekends and holidays. This logic should address the issues with incorrect adjustments and return the correct datetime value.
