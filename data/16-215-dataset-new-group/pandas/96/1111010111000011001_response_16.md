One potential issue in the `apply` function is in updating the `other` parameter where it is being overwritten with a new value without maintaining the original value. To fix this, we can create a new datetime object to store the adjusted datetime and use it throughout the function.

Another issue is with the adjustments to handle the business days, where the calculation of `skip_bd` is not used properly, leading to incorrect dates being returned.

Below is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
        adjusted_datetime = None

        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_datetime = other  # store the original datetime
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjusting other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by seconds in one business day
            business_hours_sec = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
