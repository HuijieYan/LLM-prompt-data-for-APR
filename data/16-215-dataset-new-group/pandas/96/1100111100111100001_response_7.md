The bug in the provided function is causing a ValueError to be raised while validating the frequency for a given DatetimeArray/Index or TimedeltaArray/Index, specifically in the step when the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The buggy function applies the business hours offset to a given timestamp `other`. It adjusts the timestamp based on various conditions and business hour calculations.

The potential cause of the bug is due to incorrect calculations related to business day adjustments and remaining business hours in the original function.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours and ensure that it accurately reflects the business rules and requirements based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

# The declaration of the class containing the correct function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)

            other += bd * self.next_bday.freq
    
        business_time = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
        shift = r // business_time * self.freq

        if n >= 0:
            while shift > timedelta(0):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + self.freq)
                shift -= self.freq
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other + shift)

        return as_datetime(other)
```

After making these changes, the corrected version of the function should address the logic issues causing the ValueError and ensure that the frequency and business hour offset adjustments are properly handled.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
