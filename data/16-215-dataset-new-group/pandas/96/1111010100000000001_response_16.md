1. The buggy function "apply" is defined within the class BusinessHourMixin, which is a subclass of BusinessMixin.
2. Potential error locations within the buggy function could be related to the calculations and adjustments made to the "other" datetime object based on business hour offsets.
3. The buggy function causes incorrect adjustments and calculations related to business hour offsets, leading to potential errors in the resulting datetime object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the calculations and adjustments made within the function to ensure that the business hour offsets are correctly applied to the "other" datetime object.
5. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Perform adjustments based on business hour offsets
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Update the "other" datetime object based on business hour offsets
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if n >= 0 and bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                elif n < 0 and (
                    bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0)
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The corrected version includes adjustments to accurately handle the business hour offsets and apply them to the "other" datetime object.
