The issue with the buggy function is that it produces unexpected output when adding holidays to the frequency while using the `pd.date_range` function. The output includes more periods than expected, causing discrepancies in the generated `DatetimeIndex`. This is causing failing tests and generating the error message.

The cause of the bug is due to the implementation of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function does not handle the addition of holidays properly, resulting in incorrect business days being calculated and affecting the `date_range` function's output.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the adjustments necessary to accommodate holidays when calculating business days and hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# ... (other imports)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods and functions)

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            dt = other

            # Create a CustomBusinessHour object with holidays
            custom_hour = CustomBusinessHour(
                start=self.start[0],
                end=self.end[0],
                weekmask=self.weekmask,
                holidays=self.holidays
            )

            if n >= 0:
                # Use apply_holiday parameter to verify if the date (other) is a holiday
                adjusted_date = custom_hour.apply_offset(dt, n=n, apply_holiday=True)
            else:
                # For negative offset, check if the given date is a holiday
                # If it is, move to the previous business day
                if custom_hour.on_offset(dt):
                    adjusted_date = custom_hour.apply_offset(dt, n=(n-1), apply_holiday=True)
                else:
                    adjusted_date = custom_hour.apply_offset(dt, n=n, apply_holiday=True)

            return adjusted_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the `apply` function properly handles the adjustments based on holidays, reducing the chances of discrepancies in the generated `DatetimeIndex`.

By including the `holidays` parameter in the `CustomBusinessHour` constructor, it enables the `apply` function to correctly handle business days and hours while taking holidays into account.

This modification directly addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and is expected to resolve the failing test and the unexpected output.
