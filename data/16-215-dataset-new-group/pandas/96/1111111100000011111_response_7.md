The bug in the `apply` function appears to be related to the calculation of business days and hours. The function should adjust the datetime according to business hours, but it seems to be miscalculating the adjustments, leading to unexpected behavior when adding holidays in the `date_range` function.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect adjustment of the datetime based on business days and hours
- Calculation errors when checking for holidays
- Incorrect handling of edge cases when moving to the previous business day

The cause of the bug:
The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues with correctly adjusting the given datetime according to business hours and days. This results in unexpected behavior when the datetime is used in the `date_range` function, especially when holidays are included.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime to ensure that it accurately moves through business days and hours, considering the start and end times, holidays, and edge cases.
2. Ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the expectations set by the `date_range` function when holidays are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin:

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0], holidays=self.holidays)
            return cbh.rollforward(other) if self.n > 0 else cbh.rollback(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `CustomBusinessHour` offsets directly to adjust the given datetime according to business hours, considering the provided start and end times as well as any holidays.

Please integrate this correction into the `BusinessHourMixin` class and verify that it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
