The potential bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the given datetime based on the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function should adjust the given datetime to the next or previous business hour based on the value of `self.n`, which is the number of business hours to adjust.

However, it appears that the adjustment logic is flawed and is not correctly handling cases where `n` may be positive or negative, leading to incorrect adjustments in different scenarios. Furthermore, there are conditions where time intervals are not being handled properly, potentially leading to incorrect adjustments.

Based on the provided test case, it seems that the adjustments for going to the next or previous business day are not properly handled, as well as the remaining business hours to adjust.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly based on the given `CustomBusinessHour` object and the value of `self.n`. We can also improve the handling of time intervals and business day adjustments to ensure accurate adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        adjustment_period = n * 60
        adjustment_days, adjustment_remainder = divmod(abs(adjustment_period), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            adjustment_days, adjustment_remainder = -adjustment_days, -adjustment_remainder

        if adjustment_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=adjustment_days)
            other = other + skip_bd

        business_hours_to_adjust = timedelta(minutes=adjustment_remainder)

        if n >= 0:
            while business_hours_to_adjust != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if business_hours_to_adjust < bhour:
                    other += business_hours_to_adjust
                    business_hours_to_adjust = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    business_hours_to_adjust -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while business_hours_to_adjust != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if business_hours_to_adjust > bhour:
                    other += business_hours_to_adjust
                    business_hours_to_adjust = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    business_hours_to_adjust -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with the original implementation and ensure that the adjustments are made accurately based on the specified input parameters and the `CustomBusinessHour` object. After applying these changes, the failing test cases should pass.
