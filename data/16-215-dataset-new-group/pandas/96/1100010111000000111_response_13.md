The buggy function `apply` is likely causing the incorrect behavior when using holidays in `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency (e.g., `CustomBusinessHour`). The function is designed to adjust the given datetime according to the custom business hour frequency, including accounting for holidays and business days. However, there seem to be issues with the calculation and adjustment logic, leading to unexpected results when holidays are incorporated.

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours when calculating the date range with holidays. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this, where using periods with holidays results in more than the expected number of periods in the output.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and business hours, especially with respect to holidays, needs to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the implementation for adjusting for holidays might be missing or incorrect, which can result in an incorrect date range.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust for holidays by omitting the hours in the holidays
        while other.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') in self.holidays:
            other += timedelta(days=1)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0, 0)

        # rest of the logic for business hour adjustment remains the same
        n = self.n
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        # ... (other logic remains the same)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment for holidays is added at the beginning of the function to ensure that the given datetime aligns with the custom business hour frequency, accounting for any holidays. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the date range with holidays works as expected for the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
