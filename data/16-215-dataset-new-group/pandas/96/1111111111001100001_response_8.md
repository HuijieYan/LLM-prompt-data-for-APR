The bug in the code lies in the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours. The adjustment to move to the previous business day is incorrect, and the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours is flawed. Additionally, the calculation for `bd` (business days) and `r` (remaining minutes) is not handling negative values correctly. This is leading to incorrect output when the function is applied to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours, handling negative business days and remaining hours correctly, and fixing any incorrect calculations that are causing the erroneous behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
  ...
  
  @apply_wraps
  def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= CustomBusinessDay(n=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = divmod(-r, -businesshours // 60)
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                other += CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours, handling negative business days and remaining hours correctly, and addressing the incorrect calculations, we have provided a corrected version of the code. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
