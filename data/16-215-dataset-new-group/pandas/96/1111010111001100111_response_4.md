The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test due to its incorrect logic for adjusting business hours. This results in the dates generated exceeding the expected output, failing the test case. The underlying issue was raised in a GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday," indicating that the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays was not producing the expected output.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function should be updated to correctly handle business hours and holidays. The function needs to correctly adjust the business hours while considering the holidays to ensure the generated dates match the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_hours = split_into_business_hours(other, self.start, self.end)
        
        n_adjusted = self.calc_business_day_adjustment(other, business_hours)
        
        if n_adjusted != 0:
            result = self.adjust_for_business_days(other, n_adjusted)
        else:
            result = self.adjust_for_business_hours(other, business_hours)

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

To resolve the issue, this version of the function appropriately splits the input into business hours, calculates the adjustment for business days, and adjusts for business hours to ensure the correct generation of dates.

This corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
