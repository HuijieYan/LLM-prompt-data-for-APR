The bug in the function `apply` causes the CustomBusinessHour to not be applied correctly, resulting in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic where the adjustment of the business hour is calculated and applied to the given datetime. There are multiple conditional checks and calculations that might lead to incorrect adjustments and thus an incorrect output.

The bug is caused by the logic in the `apply` function failing to properly adjust the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour, leading to an incorrect result in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start = self.start
        end = self.end

        if n >= 0:
            shift = 0
            while shift < n:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.hour in end:
                    shift += 1
        else:
            shift = 0
            while shift > n:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.hour in start:
                    shift -= 1
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    return other
```

With this corrected version, the logic has been simplified to handle the adjustment of the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour. This version is expected to pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
