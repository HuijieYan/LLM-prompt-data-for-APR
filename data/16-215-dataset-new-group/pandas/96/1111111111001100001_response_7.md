The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the business hours. The adjustments should be made based on the start and end times of the business hours, as well as the offset, but it seems that the logic for adjusting the business hours is not correct in all cases. The adjustments should consider the scenarios when the specified time is not within the business hours, when the offset is negative, and when the adjustments involve moving to the previous or next business day.

Based on the analysis, the bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the specified time, resulting in unexpected output.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected based on the specific scenarios outlined in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_opening_time = self.start[0]
        business_closing_time = self.end[0]

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > business_closing_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < business_opening_time:
                other = other.replace(hour=business_closing_time.hour, minute=business_closing_time.minute)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting the specified time based on the business hours and the offset has been carefully reviewed and revised to handle the scenarios outlined in the failing test cases. With these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
