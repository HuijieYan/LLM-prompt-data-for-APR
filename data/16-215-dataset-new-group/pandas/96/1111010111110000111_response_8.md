The `apply` function has a bug in the logic that handles the adjustment of business hours and business days. This has led to the failing test and the corresponding error message, as well as the GitHub issue where the user experienced unexpected behavior with the `date_range` function when using periods and adding a holiday.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of business hours and business days in the `apply` function when adjusting the timestamps according to the provided BusinessHour offset. This results in the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the timestamps based on business hours and days needs to be reviewed and updated. Specifically, the adjustment of business days and business hours should be carefully implemented to ensure the correct behavior when holidays are added.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Initial timezone and nanosecond adjustments
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust the timestamp based on the BusinessHour offset
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Business day and business hours adjustments
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

These changes to the `apply` function aim to improve the handling of business days and business hours, ensuring that adjustments are made correctly, accounting for holidays, and addressing the issue observed in the failing test and described in the GitHub issue.
