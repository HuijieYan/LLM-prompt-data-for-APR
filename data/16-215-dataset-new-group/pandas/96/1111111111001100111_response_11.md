The buggy function fails to properly adjust the date and time when a CustomBusinessHour with holidays is used in date_range. This leads to the incorrect generation of periods in the resulting DatetimeIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustments performed on the "other" datetime object within the "apply" function are not correctly handling the presence of holidays, leading to the additional periods being generated.

To fix the bug:
1. Check for the presence of holidays when adjusting the "other" datetime object.
2. Update the adjustment logic to properly account for holidays and adjust the date and time accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the "apply" function:

```python
# Other imports
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Remaining logic remains the same
        # ...
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected logic, the "apply" function should effectively handle the adjustments of the "other" datetime object, accounting for holidays, and returning the correct date and time values. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the date_range with CustomBusinessHour and holidays works as expected.
