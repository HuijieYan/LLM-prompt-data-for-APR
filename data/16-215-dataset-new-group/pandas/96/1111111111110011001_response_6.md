The buggy function is failing to handle the datetime offset correctly, and the error is occurring in its internal calculations. There are several components inside the function, including condition checks, adjustments, and a loop to update the `other` variable based on different conditions. The error might stem from incorrect condition checks, adjustments, or the loop itself.

Based on the test, the function is not providing the expected output, and at certain times, it is returning incorrect dates. The function is intended to apply business hours to a datetime object, and the incorrect output suggests that it is not correctly following the business-hour rules defined within the function. 

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic inside the function and ensure that it correctly applies business hours to the datetime input.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime.combine(
            other.date(),
            time(other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        )
        n = self.n
        start_times = [t for t in self.start]
        end_times = [t for t in self.end]
        
        if n >= 0:
            is_on_offset = other.time() in end_times and not self.is_on_offset(other)
            if is_on_offset or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in start_times:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(start_times, end_times))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function applies the business hours to a datetime object following the given business-hour rules and conditions. It is designed to meet the expected input and output values provided in the test cases.
