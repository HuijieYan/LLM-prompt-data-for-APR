The buggy function seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime input when the custom business hour only falls partly or not at all within a business day. This is likely contributing to the failing test cases.

The buggy function, `apply`, is designed to manipulate datetime objects based on custom business hour logic. However, it has several points where logic might produce incorrect results. The primary issues seem to be related to handling custom business hour logic that extends into different days and partially overlaps with different business intervals.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:

1. Review the logic for adjustment of datetime objects to ensure that it correctly handles cases where custom business hours overlap multiple days and/or partial business intervals.
2. Validate the adjustments made to the datetime objects against expected behavior to identify discrepancies.
3. Consider simplifying the logic in the `apply` function to improve its readability and maintainability.
4. Test the modified function against the failing test cases to ensure that it produces the expected results.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        start_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start).replace(tzinfo=other.tzinfo)
        end_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end).replace(tzinfo=other.tzinfo)
        
        if other.time() < start_time.time() or other.time() >= end_time.time() or not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = start_time if other.time() < start_time.time() else end_time  # Adjust to the start or end of the next business interval
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This modified implementation aims to directly adjust the input `other` datetime based on the start and end times of the business interval, as well as checking if the datetime is on the correct offset. This should address the issues related to misaligned adjustments and overlapping business day intervals.

After making these changes, the corrected function should be thoroughly tested against the failing test cases to ensure that it now passes them. If further issues are encountered, additional adjustments and validation may be necessary.
