The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the pandas library appears to be incorrectly calculating the next opening time in certain cases, resulting in unexpected behavior when used with custom business hours and holidays.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The logic for adjusting time to reduce the number of cases to handle.
2. The adjustment for positive and negative business days.
3. The calculation for remaining business hours to adjust, especially in the while loops for positive and negative business days.
4. The return statement at the end of the function that raises an `ApplyTypeError` if the input is not a datetime.

The cause of the bug is that the logic within the function to calculate the next opening time, adjust business days, and remaining business hours is not correctly handling the custom business hour start time and holidays.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing and adjusting the logic for determining the next opening time, handling positive and negative business days, and calculating remaining business hours to ensure that it properly accounts for custom business hours and holidays.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() == self.end:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self.end - other.time()
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                else:
                    bhour = other.time() - self.start
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()`.
