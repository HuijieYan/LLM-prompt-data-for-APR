The issue lies in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. 

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method is not adjusting the generated dates based on holidays, leading to unexpected results in the output of `pd.date_range`. The method is not correctly handling holidays when adding frequencies to `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method should be modified to properly handle holidays when applying business hour offsets. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Handle holidays and weekends
        while n != 0:
            other += pd.offsets.BDay() * np.sign(n)
            if other in self.holidays:
                continue
            n -= np.sign(n)
  
        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we loop through the dates based on the number of business days and handle holidays appropriately, bypassing them in the adjustment process.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class behaves correctly when adjusting dates.
