The cause of the bug in the given function is that the function has several lines of code with slow conditions and adjustment cases, which are complex and difficult to understand. Moreover, there are many nested loops that need to be optimized.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the given function to remove unnecessary conditions and nested loops, which would also help in improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            return self._adjust_future_date(other, businesshours, n)
        else:
            return self._adjust_past_date(other, businesshours, n)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")


def _adjust_future_date(self, other, businesshours, n):
    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

    remaining_business_hours = self._get_remaining_business_hours(other, businesshours, n)

    return self._calculate_future_date(other, remaining_business_hours)


def _adjust_past_date(self, other, businesshours, n):
    if other.time() in self.start:
        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    remaining_business_hours = self._get_remaining_business_hours(other, businesshours, n)

    return self._calculate_past_date(other, remaining_business_hours)


def _get_remaining_business_hours(self, other, businesshours, n):
    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    if bd != 0:
        other = self._adjust_by_business_days(other, bd)

    return self._adjust_remaining_business_hours(other, r, n)


def _adjust_by_business_days(self, other, bd):
    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        remain = other - prev_open
        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    else:
        other = other + skip_bd
    return other


def _adjust_remaining_business_hours(self, other, r, n):
    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)
    if n >= 0:
        for _ in range(r):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if remaining_business_hours < bhour:
                other += remaining_business_hours
                break
            else:
                remaining_business_hours -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    else:
        for _ in range(r):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if (
                remaining_business_hours > bhour
            ):
                other += remaining_business_hours
                break
            else:
                remaining_business_hours -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._next_opening_time(
                        other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
                )
    return other


def _calculate_future_date(self, other, remaining_business_hours):
    return other + remaining_business_hours


def _calculate_past_date(self, other, remaining_business_hours):
    return other - remaining_business_hours
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
