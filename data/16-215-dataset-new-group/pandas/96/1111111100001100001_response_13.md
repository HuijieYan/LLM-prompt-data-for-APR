Looking at the buggy function and the runtime values of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the issue could be related to the calculation and adjustment of the `other` datetime within the loop. Specifically, the adjustment to move to the previous business day and the adjustment to the remaining business hours seem to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic within the while loops for adjusting the remaining hours and handling business days needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# import the necessary classes
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

# ... (other imports)

# class declaration here...

# ... (other function definitions)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other class methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) 
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BaseOffset(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of `other` to move to the previous business day and the adjustments of remaining hours have been restructured to properly handle different cases based on the value of `n` and the conditions related to `self._is_on_offset` and `other.time()`. Additionally, the while loops have been adjusted to compare timedelta values using the comparison operators.

It's important to test the corrected function with adequately selected testing cases to ensure the bug has been effectively fixed.
