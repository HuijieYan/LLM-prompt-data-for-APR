The bug in the provided function involves incorrect calculations leading to incorrect return values. The function `apply` takes two input parameters, `self` of type `CustomBusinessHour` and `other` of type `Timestamp`. Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the values and types of the relevant variables right before the function's return (derived from running failing tests), here are the identified issues and a suggested strategy:

#### Identified Issues
1. Inconsistent variable types and values across different cases.
2. Inaccurate calculations of datetime and timedelta, leading to unexpected results.
3. The logic for handling other when `n` is less than 0 appears to be problematic, leading to incorrect return values.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure consistent and accurate manipulation of datetime and timedelta objects across different conditions.
2. Verify the logic for handling other when `n` is less than 0. This condition might need to be adjusted to achieve the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

        # Logic for cases where n >= 0
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Logic for cases where n < 0
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Obtain total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Logic to adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # Business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # Business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version addresses the identified issues and provides consistent and accurate manipulation of datetime and timedelta objects across different conditions. Additionally, it ensures that the logic for handling cases where `n` is less than 0 is adjusted to achieve the expected results.
