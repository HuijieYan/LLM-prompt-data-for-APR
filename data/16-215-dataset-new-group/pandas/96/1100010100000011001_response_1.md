The buggy function has several issues such as the adjustment calculations and the returning value. To fix these issues, we need to modify the adjustment calculations and the business days for negative self.n. Additionally, the return statement must be adjusted to meet the expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        timezone_offset = timedelta(seconds=other.utcoffset().total_seconds())
        adjusted_time = other - timezone_offset
        
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                adjusted_time += timedelta(days=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time) and adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                    n -= 1
            else:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(days=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time) and adjusted_time.time() in self.end:
                    n += 1
        
        # Apply any remaining time
        adjusted_hour = adjusted_time.hour
        adjusted_minute = adjusted_time.minute
        adjusted_second = adjusted_time.second
        adjusted_microsecond = adjusted_time.microsecond

        adjusted_time = datetime(
            adjusted_time.year,
            adjusted_time.month,
            adjusted_time.day,
            adjusted_hour,
            adjusted_minute,
            adjusted_second,
            adjusted_microsecond,
        )
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the function and incorporates the necessary adjustments for different dates and times. Now it should return the expected values and types of variables based on the given test cases.
