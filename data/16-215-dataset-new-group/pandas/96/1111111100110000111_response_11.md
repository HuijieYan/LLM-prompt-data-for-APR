To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to address the issue with the incorrect number of periods generated when adding holidays to the frequency. The specific issue seems to be that the `_is_on_offset` and `_next_opening_time` methods are not properly handling holidays. This can lead to date_range producing more periods than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_is_on_offset` method to properly check if the given date is on the offset, taking into account any holidays.
2. Modify the `_next_opening_time` method to skip over any holidays and move to the next valid opening time.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Convert other to datetime if it is a Timestamp
        other = other.to_pydatetime() if hasattr(other, 'to_pydatetime') else other

        # Check if other is on the offset taking holidays into account
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            # Move to the next valid opening time, skipping over any holidays
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function now calls the `_is_on_offset` and `_next_opening_time` methods with the appropriate modifications to handle holidays and move to the next valid opening time. This should address the issue with `date_range` producing unexpected periods when holidays are added to the frequency.
