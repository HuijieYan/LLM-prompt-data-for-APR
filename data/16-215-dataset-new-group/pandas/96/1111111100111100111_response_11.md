The buggy function seems to be exhibiting incorrect behavior when adjusting a given datetime based on a custom business hour frequency. This issue was reported on GitHub and is affecting the creation of a date range when using periods and adding a holiday, leading to more than the expected number of periods being generated.

Upon analyzing the provided cases and error, it appears that the buggy implementation of the `apply` function could be the cause of the issue. The computation involving adjusting the passed datetime object for different business hours and business days does not seem to be functioning correctly, leading to unexpected results in date generation.

To fix the issue, the `apply` function should be revised to correctly handle the adjustment of datetimes based on business hours and business days when a holiday is present. This involves ensuring that the adjustment logic and computations for business hours and days are correctly applied, and that the generated date range corresponds to the expected behavior.

Given these considerations, here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class CustomBusinessHour(pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = self.rollforward(other)
            start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
            end_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute)
            business_hours = (end_time - start_time).seconds / 3600

            if self.n == 0:
                return other

            # Determine the direction of adjustment
            direction = 1 if self.n > 0 else -1

            # Adjust by business days first
            if self.n // business_hours != 0:
                business_days = self.n // business_hours
                other = self.move_to_custom_business_day(other, business_days)
                remaining_hours = self.n % business_hours
            else:
                remaining_hours = self.n

            if remaining_hours != 0:
                current_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute)

                while remaining_hours != 0:
                    current_time = current_time + timedelta(hours=direction)
                    if current_time.hour in range(self.start.hour, self.end.hour):
                        remaining_hours -= direction
                other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, current_time.hour, current_time.minute)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function applies the adjustments to the datetime object based on the specified business hours and holiday, ensuring that the date range generation behaves as expected. This fix should address the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
