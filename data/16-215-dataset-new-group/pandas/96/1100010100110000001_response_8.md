There is a bug in the `apply` function of the Peter 2.3.2 dev production release. The function tries to apply a business hour offset to a datetime, but there are multiple issues with this code that cause it to fail.

The code tries to handle edge cases by manipulating the datetime, and then it calculates the total business hours to determine the shift. However, there are several issues in the calculations and adjustments of the date and time, which result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to re-evaluate the way business hours are adjusted and applied to the datetime in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):

    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # Extract the time part from the datetime
    time_part = other.time()

    # Find the next business time interval in the future
    next_business_interval = self._next_opening_time(other)

    # Find the previous business time interval in the past
    previous_business_interval = self._prev_opening_time(other)

    # Find the closing time for the current business time interval
    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)

    # Check for positive or negative shift
    shift_direction = -1 if self.n < 0 else 1

    # Loop to adjust the datetime based on the business hours
    while True:
        time_until_closing = closing_time - other
        if shift_direction == 1 and closing_time <= other:
            remaining_time = closing_time - other
        else:
            remaining_time = next_business_interval - other

        if remaining_time > timedelta(0):
            if abs(self.n) < 9*60:
                # If the shift is less than 9 business hours
                if time_until_closing <= remaining_time:
                    # Adjust the datetime and exit the loop
                    return other + time_until_closing
                else:
                    # Adjust the datetime and continue looping
                    other = next_business_interval
                    next_business_interval = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    remaining_time = next_business_interval - other
            else:
                # If the shift is more than 9 business hours
                other = next_business_interval
                next_business_interval = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # No remaining time, exit the loop
            return other

    return other
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the business hours offset properly and provide the expected output.
