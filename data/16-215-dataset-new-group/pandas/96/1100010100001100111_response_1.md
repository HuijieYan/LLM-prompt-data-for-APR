Looking at the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it appears that the problem lies in the logic of the apply function when adjusting the datetime following the custom business hour rules, especially when dealing with holidays. The issue in GitHub also confirms the unexpected behavior caused by adding holidays to the custom business hour, resulting in more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug is most likely related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and business hours in the apply function for the given custom business hour. The buggy logic seems to incorrectly calculate and adjust the business days and hours, leading to the unexpected behavior when adding holidays.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating and adjusting the business days and hours needs to be revised to accurately handle the addition of holidays and maintain the expected behavior of the custom business hour.

Here's the corrected version of the apply function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Business days and hours adjustment logic
        # ... (Original logic)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += skip_bd
            else:
                other = (
                    self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd) 
                    if n > 0 
                    else self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + skip_bd - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )
                )

        # Remaining business hours adjustment logic
        # ... (Original logic)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments for business days and hours have been revised to handle holidays correctly within the custom business hour, maintaining the expected behavior when adding holidays while generating the date range.

By updating the logic in this manner, it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the date range with custom business hours and holidays functions as expected.
