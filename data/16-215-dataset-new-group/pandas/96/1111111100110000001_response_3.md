The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file pandas/tseries/offsets.py. This function is responsible for adjusting a datetime based on the BusinessHourMixin properties. The error message from the failing test occurs within a method called `_validate_frequency`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The transformation of the 'other' datetime to remove timezone and nanosecond, which may cause unintended changes.
2. The adjustments made based on the sign of 'n' and whether it's greater than or less than 0.
3. The calculation of the total business hours by second in one business day.
4. The adjustment by business days and remaining business hours.
5. The while loops that adjust the business hours incrementally until the remainders are zero.

The error is likely caused by these potential error locations and how the adjustments are made to the 'other' datetime and the business hours.

To fix the bug, we should review and simplify the logic for adjusting the 'other' datetime and the business hours, considering the edge cases and signs of 'n'. Additionally, we should ensure that the adjustments do not inadvertently violate the frequency constraints.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustments made to the 'other' datetime and ensures that the frequency constraints are not violated.
