The buggy function `apply` seems to be incorrectly computing business hours and handling business time intervals. This results in incorrect adjustments of the `other` datetime parameter and ultimately leads to unexpected outputs. The function should accurately adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and handle the edge cases properly.

A potential cause of the bug is incorrect handling of the remaining time and the adjustment to the next business time interval. It seems the function does not handle negative business days properly and may have issues with calculating the remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately calculate and adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and proper handling of business time intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    if other.time() in self.start:
        opening_time = other
    else:
        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

    business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    if self.n >= 0:
        new_datetime = opening_time + timedelta(seconds=60 * self.n * business_hours)
    else:
        new_datetime = opening_time - timedelta(seconds=60 * self.n * business_hours)

    return new_datetime
```

In this corrected version, we modified the logic to properly calculate the new datetime based on the business hours and the specified business time intervals. We handle both positive and negative business days to adjust the timedelta of the new datetime accordingly.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
