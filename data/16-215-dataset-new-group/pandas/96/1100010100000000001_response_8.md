The buggy function has a few potential error locations, such as the use of a mix of `datetime` and `Timestamp`, incorrect comparison of `timedelta` with `0`, and potential calculation errors with `bhour_remain` and business time intervals.

The main cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all edge conditions and calculations properly, leading to incorrect output in some cases.

To fix the bug, I suggest implementing a strategy to ensure that all conditions and calculations are handled correctly, and that the function can handle both `datetime` and `Timestamp` inputs consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class CustomBusinessHour(BaseOffset):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # add logic to adjust for business days
            if n > 0:
                # adjust for business hours
                businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )
                timedelta_for_hours = timedelta(seconds=n * 60)
                business_day_adjustment, remaining_hours = divmod(timedelta_for_hours, timedelta(minutes=businesshours // 60))
                if remaining_hours < 0:
                    remaining_hours = 0

                if business_day_adjustment.days > 0:
                    other += BusinessDay(n=business_day_adjustment.days)

                # adjust for remaining business hours
                while remaining_hours.total_seconds() > 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    time_interval = closing_time - other
                    if remaining_hours > time_interval or (
                            remaining_hours == time_interval and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += remaining_hours
                        remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        remaining_hours -= time_interval
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + time_interval)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the function has been refactored to handle the edge conditions related to business days, business hours, and time intervals more accurately and consistently. Additionally, the function uses the `apply` method to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly.
