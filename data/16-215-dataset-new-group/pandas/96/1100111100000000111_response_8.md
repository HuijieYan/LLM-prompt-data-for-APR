The buggy function seems to be causing an issue when using periods and adding holidays with the `pd.date_range` function. It is resulting in more periods than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The issue is likely related to the `apply` function, which is intended to adjust the datetime based on business hours. However, it seems to be adjusting the datetime incorrectly when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to carefully review the logic inside the `apply` function, specifically the handling of holidays and how it modifies the datetime. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime when processing holidays are correct and do not interfere with the expected period behavior in the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjusting the datetime based on business hours
        # ... (existing logic remains unchanged)

        # Check if the adjusted datetime falls on a holiday and make necessary adjustments
        is_holiday = other.date() in self.holidays
        if is_holiday:
            # Increment or decrement the adjusted datetime based on the holiday
            adjust = timedelta(days=1) if self.n > 0 else timedelta(days=-1)
            while other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += adjust

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we added logic to detect holidays in the adjusted datetime and make the necessary adjustments. This should ensure that the `apply` function behaves correctly when used in conjunction with the `pd.date_range` function, addressing the reported issue.

It's important to test this fix with various scenarios involving holidays and periods to ensure that the behavior is consistent and accurate.
