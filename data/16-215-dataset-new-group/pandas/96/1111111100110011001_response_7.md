The buggy function has errors related to the manipulation of dates and times and irregularly structured calls to class methods. The buggy function `apply` has instances of "self.next_bday", which is incorrectly structured; it seems to be calling an instance variable or class method like a method, as it misses the parenthesis for the method call. Also, it is calling the undefined object `BusinessDay`. No specific error was reported from a failing test related to `is_on_offset` function that returns incorrect output.

The buggy function `apply` should be structured correctly and follow the appropriate class method calls. Based on the context, it appears that "next_bday" and "`BusinessDay`" are class attributes or methods, and these should be properly referenced.

The following is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):


    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the `self.next_bday` references have been kept in the absence of clear context of its purpose, assuming that it is a valid reference within the codebase. However, it's worth noting that it should be used as `self.next_bday()` instead of just `self.next_bday` if it is a method.
