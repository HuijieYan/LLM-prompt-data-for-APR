## Analysis
The `apply` function appears to be calculating the next open time based on the input `other`. However, it seems to be incorrectly calculating the next business hour, leading to incorrect results when adjusting for holidays.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the logic that calculates the next business hour and adjusts for holidays. This results in an incorrect increase in the number of periods when a holiday is added to the frequency.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect calculation of the next business hour and the handling of holidays.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug is to thoroughly review and adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly account for holidays and the next business hour for different scenarios.

## Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        next_opening = other if self.n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)
        while n != 0:
            adjustment = self.n // abs(self.n) if self.n != 0 else 1  # check for negative N
            if not self.on_offset(next_opening):  # check if next opening is not on offset
                next_opening = self.rollforward(next_opening)  # rollforward the next opening
            next_opening += adjustment * self.get_step()  # adjust next opening
            n -= adjustment

        return next_opening
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should handle the adjustment for business hours and holidays correctly, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
