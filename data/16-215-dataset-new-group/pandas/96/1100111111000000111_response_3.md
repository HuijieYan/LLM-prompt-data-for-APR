The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file contains a logic error when handling periods that include holidays. This error is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce more than the expected number of periods when a holiday is added to the frequency.

The strategy to fix this bug is to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours and holiday periods within the `apply` function. Additionally, the logic for adjusting periods and business days needs to be refined to ensure that it behaves as expected, even when holidays are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function `apply`
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = other.time()

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                if start_time < self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if start_time >= self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n += 1
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the logic issues by adjusting the `other` datetime based on the business hours and holidays. It ensures that the `apply` function handles the adjustment of periods correctly, even when holidays are included in the frequency.

With this correction, the failing test related to the issue on GitHub should pass successfully.
