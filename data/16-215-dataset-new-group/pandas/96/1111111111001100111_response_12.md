The identified issue in the `apply` function is that it incorrectly calculates the business hours, does not handle holidays properly, and does not adjust the BusinessDay when special dates, such as holidays, are involved. This leads to unexpected results when used in conjunction with the `date_range` function, as described in the GitHub issue. 

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to handle the adjustment of business days and hours, taking into account holidays and other special dates.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = next_opening
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r) if r != 0 else timedelta(0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour_timing = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(bhour_timing) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour_timing = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = bhour_timing - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(bhour_timing - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues related to holiday handling, business day adjustment, and business hours calculation. It should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `date_range` functions correctly, even when holidays are involved.
