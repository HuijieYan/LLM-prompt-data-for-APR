 
The cause of the bug is the ApplyTypeError exception because the condition for the isinstance(other, datetime) check is not being met, which results in the exception being raised.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to address the condition for isinstance(other, datetime) so that the exception is not raised. This can be done by checking if the type of other is a subclass of datetime, since pandas.DateTimeIndex is often used for business days and timestamps.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex
    if isinstance(other, datetime) or isinstance(other, DatetimeIndex):
        if isinstance(other, DatetimeIndex) and len(other) == 1:
            other = other[0]

        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # rest of the code for the function
        # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime or DatetimeIndex")
```

In the corrected version, we check if other is an instance of `DatetimeIndex` and has a length of 1, then we extract the element with `other[0]`. If it's an instance of the `datetime` class, we proceed as before. These checks ensure that the exception is not raised when `other` is a suitable object for the function.
