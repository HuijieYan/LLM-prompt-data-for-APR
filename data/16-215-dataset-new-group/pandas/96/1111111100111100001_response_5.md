The bug in the provided function is that the custom business hours are not being calculated correctly. The function is not properly adjusting the datetime for a custom business hour offset.

The main issue in the function is with the adjustment of the business hours and the business days. The logic to adjust business days and business hours within the given custom business hour is not being applied correctly.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for business days and business hours should be revisited and modified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n == 0:
            return other  # no adjustment needed

        if n > 0:
            # For positive n, adjust to the next opening time if not already on offset
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # For negative n, adjust to the previous opening time and then to the next closing time
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected logic, the function should properly adjust the custom business hours for the given datetime input.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure it functions as expected.
