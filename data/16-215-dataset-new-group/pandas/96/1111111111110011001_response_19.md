The buggy function originates in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The `apply` method takes as input an instance of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, `other`, and returns a corrected `datetime`.

The function fails because in several cases, based on the input provided by the failing test, incorrect adjustments are made to the input `datetime` object. This results in the function returning incorrect `datetime` values, leading to a ValueError during the test.

The following adjustments are needed to correct the bug:
- The calculations to adjust to the next opening time should be corrected.
- The adjustment by business days should be handled correctly using the `skip_bd` object.
- The remaining business hours need to be calculated and adjusted correctly to ensure the correct output `datetime`.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other) if n >= 0 else (self._next_opening_time(other) - other)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other += min(bhour_remain, (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other))
                    bhour_remain = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other) if bhour_remain > timedelta(0) else (self._next_opening_time(other) - other)

            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if bhour_remain > timedelta(0) or (bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and nanosecond != 0):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    else:
                        other -= min(-1*bhour_remain, (self._next_opening_time(other) - other))
                    bhour_remain = (self._next_opening_time(other) - other) + timedelta(seconds=1) if bhour_remain < timedelta(0) else (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should be able to satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
