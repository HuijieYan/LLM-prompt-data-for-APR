First, I'll try to fix the bugs found in the function. Then, I'll provide a corrected version of the function based on that fix.

### Analyzing the Bug
From the provided code and expected input/output values, the main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect updating and adjustments made to the `other` datetime object within the function. The logic for the adjustments to `other` seems to be mixed up and might result in incorrect returns.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the value of `n` seem to be incorrect.
2. The logic for handling the business days, business hours, and adjusting `bhour_remain` also seems to be mixed up.

### Bug Cause
The adjustments made to the `other` datetime object for different cases are not properly coordinated and might result in incorrect output. The adjustments are likely overwriting and negating each other, leading to incorrect final values.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve a comprehensive review of the adjustment logic and making sure that the adjustments work coherently to achieve the correct final `other` datetime object.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                n += 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, a clearer logic is applied to handle the adjustments based on the value of `n`. The adjustments use the `_next_opening_time` and `_prev_opening_time` methods to appropriately handle different cases, ensuring that the final `other` datetime object is correctly adjusted according to the provided value of `n`. This should result in a more coherent and correct adjustment of the timestamp.

Please use this corrected version and test it against the expected input/output values to ensure that it satisfies the given cases.
