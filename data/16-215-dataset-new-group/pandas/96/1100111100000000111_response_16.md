After analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` function that is a subclass of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

The buggy function seems to miscalculate periods when adding holidays, leading to more periods in the date range than expected.

The potential error is likely in the logic for adjusting the date-time when holidays are involved, as demonstrated by the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for adjusting the date-time to correctly handle holidays and their effect on the number of periods in the date range.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# ... (previous code)

# Fix the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Get the start and end values from the self object
            start_dt = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute
            )
            end_dt = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute
            )

            # Calculate the number of business hours
            business_hours = (end_dt - start_dt).total_seconds() / 3600

            # Adjust for holidays and business days
            if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() in self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                days = self.next_bday(self.n)
                other = other + timedelta(days=days)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we obtain the start and end values from the `self` object and calculate the number of business hours. Then, we adjust the date-time for holidays and business days accordingly.

By implementing these adjustments, the corrected version of the `apply` method should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the date range behavior when adding holidays in custom business hours.
