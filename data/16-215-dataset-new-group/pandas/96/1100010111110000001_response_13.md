The bug in the `apply` function is causing a ValueError in the failing test. The failing test references the CustomBusinessHour frequency with a start time of "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26". The error message specifically states that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH."

The bug here seems to be related to the handling of holidays and the adjustments related to business hours. The call to the `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustments for holidays and business hours, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business hours consider the holidays correctly and that the adjustments for dates are accurately calculated.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

# This is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_hour = self
        if isinstance(business_hour, CustomBusinessHour):
            holidays = getattr(business_hour, "holidays", [])

            # Adjust the date based on holidays
            if other.date() in holidays:
                other = self.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = self.rollback(other)

        else:
            if isinstance(business_hour, BusinessHour):
                other = self.rollforward(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected function, the adjustments for holidays and business hours will be calculated correctly. This should resolve the ValueError in the failing test and ensure that the `apply` function works as expected.
