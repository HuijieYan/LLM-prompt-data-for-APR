The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is that it does not handle the business hour offsets correctly when holidays are added. This leads to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, resulting in an incorrect number of periods when holidays are specified.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `apply` function to properly handle the offset calculations when holidays are present.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # use the replace method to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

        # get the total business hours for the given day
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(
            start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0]
        )

        # adjust the date to align with business hour boundaries
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            start_time = self.start[0].value
            diff = other - start_time
            periods, remainder = divmod((diff.seconds + diff.days * 86400), business_hours)
            if periods < 0:
                periods = periods - 1
            other = start_time + timedelta(seconds=periods * business_hours)

        # adjust to next opening time if the offset is positive
        if self.n > 0:
            while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # adjust to previous closing time if the offset is negative
            while other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function takes into account the business hours, holiday adjustments, and the direction of the offset to ensure that the date alignment is properly handled. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Applying this fix should address the problem and make the `pd.date_range` function work consistently even when holidays are added to the custom business hour offset.
