The buggy function `apply` seems to have issues handling the custom business hours and properly adjusting the input `other` according to the business hours. The root cause of the bug is likely to be the incorrect handling of the custom business hour adjustments in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to properly adjust the input `other` according to the custom business hours. This could involve handling the holidays and other parameters associated with business hours more accurately.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        adjusted = self.n * 60
        if adjusted > 0:
            other = other + CustomBusinessHour(adjusted, start=self.start, end=self.end)
        else:
            other = other - CustomBusinessHour(abs(adjusted), start=self.start, end=self.end)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this version, the input `other` is adjusted based on the custom business hours, handling positive and negative adjustments correctly. This should address the issue of the failing test and the associated error.
