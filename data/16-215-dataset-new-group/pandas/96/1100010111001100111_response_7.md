The issue with the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file leads to unexpected behavior when creating a date range using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays. The function is failing to correctly adjust the date and time based on business hours, leading to more than the expected number of periods in the date range.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the conditional checks for adjusting `other` to reduce the number of cases to handle, as well as the adjustment by business days and remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of business hours and the adjustment of the date and time when holidays are present, resulting in the wrong number of periods in the date range. This is evident from the failing test case and the runtime input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the adjustments based on business days and business hours are correctly calculated and applied based on the provided holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments based on business days, business hours, and holidays are simplified to ensure the correct number of periods in the date range. This version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
