The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is part of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency. The error message shows that the issue is related to the validation of the frequency, and specifically that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The cause of the bug is an error in the logic for adjusting the business hours. The way the business hours are adjusted for positive and negative values of `n` seems to be incorrect, and it is causing the date range creation to fail.

The buggy function needs to be fixed by revising the business hours adjustment logic, especially for negative values of `n`. The adjustment logic should also handle edge cases more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (other code remains the same)
            # Adjust the business hours by checking for positive or negative values of `n`
            if n >= 0:
                # Adjust for positive `n` values
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Adjust for negative `n` values
                if other.time() in self.start and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                elif other.time() not in self.start and self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                # Other code to handle business days, remaining business hours, etc.

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the logic as indicated above, the corrected version of the `apply` method should resolve the issues observed in the failing test.
