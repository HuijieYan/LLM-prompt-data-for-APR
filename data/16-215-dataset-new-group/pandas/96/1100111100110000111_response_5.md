The bug is related to the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected when adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency.

The bug is located in the `apply` function. The function is not offsetting the date correctly when a holiday is present, resulting in more periods being generated than expected.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When a holiday is present, the function fails to adjust the date correctly, leading to unexpected behavior during date_range generation.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be updated to correctly account for holidays and adjust the dates accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            # If it's a holiday, find the next business day
            other = self.next_bday(other)
        
        # Rest of the logic remains the same
        # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By properly handling holidays in the `apply` function, the issue with generating more periods than expected should be resolved. This fix ensures that the date is correctly adjusted when a holiday is present.
