The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file causes unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, specifically when a holiday is added. This results in more periods than expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `_next_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` methods are not correctly adjusting the `other` timestamp when `n` is greater than or equal to 0. This prevents the `pd.date_range` function from producing the expected number of periods when a holiday is added.

To fix this bug, the adjustment of the `other` timestamp needs to be corrected within the `apply` function. Additionally, the logic for adjusting `other` within the `apply` function needs to be updated to handle holidays properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjust for holidays
        while self._is_on_offset(other) and other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of `other` is updated to correctly handle the presence of holidays, ensuring that the correct number of periods is produced by the `pd.date_range` function.
