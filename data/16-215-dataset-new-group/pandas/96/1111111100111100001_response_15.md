Looking at the buggy function, it appears that the code is trying to adjust the given timestamp (`other`) based on the business hours specified by the object `self`. However, there are several issues with the current implementation, as indicated by the failing test cases.

1. The function is attempting to compare a Timestamp object with a datetime object. This could be a source of errors.
2. The logic to adjust business hours and days seems overly complex and may be resulting in incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic within the `apply` function and ensure that the comparison and arithmetic operations are performed using the correct types of objects. Based on the failing test cases, the key issue seems to be the calculation of business days and adjusting timestamps within the business hours.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # Create a new timestamp to ensure it does not retain any frequency attributes
    other = datetime(
        other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
    )

    # Calculate the difference in hours from the start to the end of the business day
    business_hours = (self.end[0].hour - self.start[0].hour) * 60

    # Calculate the total number of business days and remaining business hours
    total_minutes = self.n * business_hours
    total_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, 60 * business_hours)

    # Add the total business days to the 'other' timestamp
    if total_days != 0:
        other += timedelta(days=total_days)

    # Check if the timestamp is within business hours
    business_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute)
    business_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute)
    
    if other < business_start:
        other = business_start
    elif other >= business_end:
        other = business_start + timedelta(days=1)

    # Add the remaining business hours
    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

    return other
```

It's important to note that the actual logic may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements for handling business hours and day adjustments. Additionally, the code could be further optimized for clarity and efficiency.

Please ensure thorough testing of the corrected function to verify its correctness.
