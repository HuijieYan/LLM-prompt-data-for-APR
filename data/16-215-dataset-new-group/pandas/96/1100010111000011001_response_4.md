To fix the buggy function, we need to address the problem related to the variable `bhour_remain`. The code is not accounting for the negative values of `n` when converting them from minutes to `timedelta`. Additionally, the `BusinessDay` variable `skip_bd` is being used without prior initialization. 

To fix the issue, we can initialize `skip_bd` to be equal to `self.next_bday` before using it. Additionally, we can convert the negative business minutes to represent the business hours properly. 
Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # initialize BusinessDay if needed
        if n < 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=self.n)  # initialize BusinessDay
        else:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay()

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

```

With these correction, the `apply` function should work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
