The bug lies in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub describes unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays. The `CustomBusinessHour` offset is not properly handling the holidays when generating the date range.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function in the `CustomBusinessHour` class is not correctly adjusting for holidays. As a result, when holidays are added, the date range is not being calculated properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the output.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class needs to be updated to properly adjust for holidays when generating the date range.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code goes here
            
            # adjust for holidays
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and self.holidays:
                from pandas.tseries.holiday import Holiday
                from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

                if isinstance(self.holidays, Holiday) or all(isinstance(h, Holiday) for h in self.holidays):
                    index = CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays).apply(pd.date_range(other, other))
                    if other in index:
                        other = index[-1]
                    else:
                        for offset in [self, -self]:
                            index = CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays).apply(pd.date_range(other, other + offset, closed='right'))   
                            if other in index:
                                other = index[-1]
                                break
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Holidays must be a Holiday or list of Holidays")
            # adjust dates
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The updated `apply` function now includes adjustments for holidays using the existing `holidays` attribute. It checks if `holidays` is provided, and if so, adjusts the date range accordingly to account for the holidays. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the date range is correctly calculated even when holidays are added.
