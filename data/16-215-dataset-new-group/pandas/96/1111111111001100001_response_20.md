The bug in the provided function is causing it to fail the test. The issue seems to be related to the adjustment of the new date and time based on the given business hours and holidays.

The buggy function attempts to adjust the date and time based on the business hours and prior business days. There are multiple adjustments and calculations done on the input `other` which may lead to incorrect results.

The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect adjustments done on the `other` date and time when calculating business days and business hours. Additionally, some variable and method references seem incorrect, such as `self.next_bday.is_on_offset`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments and calculations are correctly performed based on the input `other`, current business hours, and holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            while self._get_closing_time(other) <= other:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            while self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the correct method calls and simple adjustments, the updated version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
