Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `apply` function appears to be related to the logic for adjusting business hours and working with datetime objects. The function is designed to adjust the datetime object based on business hours as defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. 

The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime object when considering the business hours and holiday dates. It's also important to note that the function seems to be redundant in some parts, leading to incorrect adjustments.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, holidays, and weekends. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the adjustments consider the business hours correctly and handle edge cases such as holidays and weekends.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            other += BusinessHour(n=n*60)
        else:
            next_bday = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = next_bday + BusinessHour(n=n*60)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for adjusting the datetime object is simplified and explicitly handles the business hours and holidays. Additionally, the adjusted datetime is determined directly and returned appropriately to ensure correct results. This revised logic should address the buggy behavior identified in the failing test cases.
