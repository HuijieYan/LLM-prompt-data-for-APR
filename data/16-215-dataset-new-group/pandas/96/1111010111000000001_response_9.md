The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is part of the `pandas` library. This method is used to apply business hours to a given datetime value. 

The potential error locations within the `apply` method include:
1. No handling for the case where `other` is a `Timestamp` object.
2. Incorrect calculations for adjusting business days and business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` method fails to correctly adjust the datetime value based on the specified business hours, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check for the `Timestamp` type and handle it appropriately.
2. Correct the calculations for adjusting business days and business hours.

Given the buggy function and the failing test, below is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = as_datetime(other)  # Convert to pandas Timestamp
            
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= self.__class__(offset=1)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                curr_diff = (other - self.start[0]).seconds
            else:
                curr_diff = (self._next_opening_time(other) - self.start[0]).seconds
            
            business_hours = sum(en - st for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60 * business_hours), business_hours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + bd * BusinessHour(n=1)
                
            if r != 0:
                while r > 0:
                    if n >= 0:
                        diff = self.end[0] - other.time()
                    else:
                        diff = other.time() - self.start[-1]
                    
                    if diff.seconds <= r*60:
                        r -= diff.seconds // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # move to the next business hour
                    else:
                        other = other + timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                while r < 0:
                    if n >= 0:
                        diff = self.end[0] - other
                    else:
                        diff = other - self.start[-1]
                    
                    if diff.seconds <= abs(r)*60:
                        r += diff.seconds // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # move to the previous business hour
                    else:
                        other = other - timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                        r = 0
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` method, it should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
