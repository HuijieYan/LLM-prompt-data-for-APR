The bug in the provided `apply` function seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables inside the function, it appears that the bug is leading to incorrect adjustments of the date and time when dealing with positive and negative business hour increments.

The primary issue seems to be in how the function calculates and adjusts the remaining business hours and days. The logic for adjusting business days and the remaining business hours may be incorrect, leading to the incorrect output observed during the failing tests.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and correct the logic for adjusting the business days and hours based on the value of `n`, which represents the number of business hours to shift. It might also involve refactoring the calculation of business days and hours to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            # Calculate the adjusted date and time for positive business hour increments
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
        else:
            # Calculate the adjusted date and time for negative business hour increments
            adjusted_date = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))) if other.time() in self.start else other

        # Business days and remaining hours adjustment
        adjusted_date += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(n * 60, start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0]).apply(other - adjusted_date)

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustments for business days and hours have been refactored to ensure proper handling of positive and negative business hour increments. The logic has been simplified to calculate the adjusted date and time based on the value of `n`, and then apply the business hour offset using the `CustomBusinessHour` class for the remaining hours and business days.

This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
