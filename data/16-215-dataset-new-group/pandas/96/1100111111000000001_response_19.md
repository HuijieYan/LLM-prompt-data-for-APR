The bug lies within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, specifically in the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime when the `n` value (number of business hours to adjust) is negative.

The buggy logic in the `apply` function is causing the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` to produce incorrect results when using custom business hours. The test is expecting the adjusted datetime index to skip the non-business day '2020-11-26' and to correctly adjust the business hours as per the business hour offset, but due to the bug, the adjustment is not happening correctly.

The strategy to fix the bug involves correcting the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime when `n` is negative. The adjustment logic should correctly handle moving back to the previous business day, checking the start time, and adjusting the `other` datetime accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)

            # adjust other to the closing time of the previous business day
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = prev_open
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # ... (remaining existing code)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, when handling the case where `n` is negative, the function correctly moves to the previous business day using the `_prev_opening_time` and `_get_closing_time` functions, and then it adjusts the `other` datetime to the closing time of the previous business day if it's not on the offset. This strategy ensures that the custom business hours are correctly adjusted, addressing the bug and allowing the failing test to produce the expected results.
