## Issues with the Buggy Function
1. The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `offsets.py` file is not handling the provided holidays correctly.
2. The code is producing more periods when holidays are added, as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The issue on GitHub suggests that the `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays is not working as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the holidays inside the `apply` function. When providing holidays, the function fails to adjust the resulting datetime index correctly, leading to additional periods.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
The fix should involve modifying the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and ensure that the resulting datetime index is adjusted according to the specified business hours, taking holidays into account.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Other date is a holiday.")

        # rest of the code (unchanged)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding the condition to check if `other` is a holiday, we can ensure that the resulting datetime index will not include holidays in the additional periods. This should resolve the behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
