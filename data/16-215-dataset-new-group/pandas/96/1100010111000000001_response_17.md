The buggy function is the `apply` function, which is expected to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. The function handles cases where `other` is a datetime, adjusts `other` according to the custom business hours, and returns the adjusted datetime.

The potential error location is in the logic for adjusting the datetime according to the custom business hours, specifically in the while loops that handle the remaining business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours in the while loops is not correctly calculating the adjusted datetime when `n < 0`. This causes the function to return an incorrect datetime, leading to the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic in the while loops to accurately handle the remaining business hours when `n < 0`.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # code for detecting edge condition omitted for brevity
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # businesshours calculation omitted for brevity

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first omitted for brevity

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the logic in the while loops to accurately handle the remaining business hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected results.
