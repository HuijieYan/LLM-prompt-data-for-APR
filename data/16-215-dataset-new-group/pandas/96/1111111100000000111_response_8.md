To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the buggy `apply` function to handle the edge condition when adding holidays, as described in the GitHub issue.
2. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly determine the number of periods when holidays are added.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import Holiday

# Rest of the code remains the same as provided in the original buggy function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Check if there are any holidays
            holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
            for holiday in holidays:
                # If the holiday is encountered within the period, adjust the number of periods
                if holiday.date() > other.date():
                    n -= 1
            
            # The rest of the logic remains the same

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

In the corrected `apply` function, the logic has been updated to adjust the number of periods `n` based on the encountered holidays, ensuring that the correct number of periods is returned in cases where holidays are added.

This fix should address the issue experienced by the user who reported the bug in the GitHub issue.
