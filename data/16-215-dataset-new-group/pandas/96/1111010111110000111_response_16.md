To identify the potential error locations in the buggy function, we need to check whether the `apply` function correctly adjusts for the `holidays` argument when provided with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The failure in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` suggests that the `CustomBusinessHour` offset does not handle the holidays correctly when used with `pd.date_range`.

The error message from the failing test indicates a ValueError raised when calling `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and providing holidays. The expected result is different from the actual result, leading to a failure in the validation of the frequency. The provided GitHub issue also aligns with this failure, where the `pd.date_range` does not work as expected when using periods and adding holidays.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to correctly account for the holidays when adjusting the datetime. It's likely that the current implementation doesn't handle holidays properly, resulting in the incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range.

The corrected version of the function should address the issue with the incorrect number of periods when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays.

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... existing logic ...

            # adjust to handle holidays
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # remaining logic remains unchanged
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we introduced a check for holidays and adjusted the `other` datetime accordingly. This change should ensure that the `CustomBusinessHour` offset accounts for holidays, resulting in the correct number of periods being generated when used with `pd.date_range`.
