The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is meant to handle the application of custom business hours to a given datetime.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for adjusting the provided datetime based on business hours and days appears to be causing the unexpected behavior.
2. The calculation for business hours and the adjustment of the datetime might be incorrect, leading to the incorrect frequency in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function, when handling custom business hours with holidays, does not correctly adjust the datetime, leading to an increased number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the provided datetime based on business hours and days.
2. Ensure that the calculation for business hours and the adjustment of the datetime are correct, accounting for holidays.
3. Verify that the application of business hours to the datetime aligns with the expected behavior of `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours and holidays.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
        other = as_datetime(other)
        
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other, n = self._adjust_for_offset_before(other, n)
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = self._get_business_days_and_remain(n, business_hours)
        
        other = self._adjust_by_business_days(other, bd)
        
        other = self._adjust_for_remaining_hours(other, r, n, business_hours, nanosecond)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic of the `apply` function with the corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass as expected based on the GitHub issue provided.
