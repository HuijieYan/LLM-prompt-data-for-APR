The potential error in the `apply` function lies in the way it adjusts the datetime for business hours. It seems to be incorrectly handling the case when the business hour extends past midnight, as well as the logic for adjusting business days. This may be leading to unexpected results when calculating the adjusted datetime for the custom business hour.

To fix the bug, we need to review and update the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class CustomBusinessHour(BaseOffset):
    # ...
    # other methods

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            
            if other in apply_index_wraps:
                result = apply_index_wraps[other]
            else:
                # adjust the input datetime
                start = datetime(
                    other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute
                )
                end = datetime(
                    other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute
                )

                if start.time() <= other.time() <= end.time():
                    result = datetime(
                        other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute
                    )
                elif other.time() < start.time():
                    result = datetime(
                        other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute
                    )
                else:
                    result = datetime(
                        other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute
                    )

                apply_index_wraps[other] = result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
