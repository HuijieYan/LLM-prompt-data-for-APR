Given the error message and GitHub issue, it seems that the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency isn't working properly when using periods and adding holidays. The issue arises because the custom business hour frequency is not properly handling holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the date range.

One potential cause of the bug is the `pandas` library's inability to correctly handle custom business hours when holidays are specified. This likely affects the logic of calculating periods, leading to discrepancies in the date range generation.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic within the `apply` function to ensure that holidays are correctly handled, and the period calculations result in the expected date range.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        business_days = int(self.n / 9)  # Total business days for adjustment
        remaining_hours = self.n % 9  # Remaining business hours for adjustment
        current_datetime = other

        if business_days != 0:
            # Adjust by business days first
            while business_days != 0:
                if business_days > 0:
                    current_datetime = self._next_opening_time(current_datetime)
                    business_days -= 1
                else:
                    current_datetime -= timedelta(days=1)
                    current_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(current_datetime)
                    business_days += 1

        if remaining_hours != 0:
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            if self.n > 0:
                while remaining_hours > 0:
                    current_datetime = self._next_opening_time(current_datetime)
                    remaining_hours -= 1
            else:
                while remaining_hours < 0:
                    current_datetime -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(current_datetime):
                        remaining_hours += 1
                    else:
                        current_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(current_datetime)

        return current_datetime

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that business days and remaining hours are handled separately and adjusted correctly. By making these adjustments, the function should correctly handle custom business hours with holidays and periods.

By implementing this fix, the `date_range` function should work as expected and provide the correct date range even when using periods and holidays with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
