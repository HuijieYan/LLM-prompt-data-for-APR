## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on business hours and holidays. It calculates the business hours, adjusts the datetime for business days first, and then handles the remaining business hours. The buggy function has issues in the `if` condition checks and adjustments, which lead to unexpected behavior when holidays are included. It produces more periods than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Issues:
1. The calculation of business days (`skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)`) and its conditional adjustment based on the next business day is not correctly implemented.
2. The handling of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) is incorrect, and the conditional checks do not handle all cases accurately.
3. The adjustments to `other` based on the remaining business hours have inconsistencies and incorrect logic.
4. The `ApplyTypeError` exception is raised, but the error message may not always provide adequate information about the actual issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the logic for calculating and adjusting business days, ensuring that it adjusts the datetime correctly based on the given business days.
2. Re-evaluate the conditional checks and adjustments for the remaining business hours to ensure that all cases are handled accurately.
3. Improve the error handling by providing more detailed error messages if the input type is not as expected.
