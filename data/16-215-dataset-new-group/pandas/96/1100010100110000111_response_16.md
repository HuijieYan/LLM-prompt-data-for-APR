The buggy function `apply` is causing an incorrect date_range behavior when using periods and adding holidays in the date_range method, as described in the GitHub issue. The issue occurs when adding holidays, causing more than the expected number of periods in the output.

Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is due to incorrect adjustments relating to business hours and the treatment of holidays. The adjustments applied to the datetime `other` within the `apply` function are not properly handling the case when holidays are added, resulting in incorrect business hours in the output.

To fix this bug, I suggest revising the adjustments made in the `apply` function to properly account for holidays when calculating business hours. This may involve customized logic for handling holidays, or adjusting the treatment of business hours when holidays are present.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other_business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=other.time(), end=other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(hours=1))
            holiday_dates = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
            if other.date() in holiday_dates:
                return other

            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other_business_hour.onOffset(other)
            else:
                if other.time() == self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other_business_hour.onOffset(other)
                    other = self.apply(other, -1)

            # adjust business days
            business_days = n // 9
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            business_hours = n % 9
            for _ in range(business_hours):
                other = self.apply(other, 1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    return wrapper
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue by properly accounting for holidays when adjusting business hours. The logic has been updated to consider holidays in the calculations and to handle adjustments for business days and remaining business hours separately.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
