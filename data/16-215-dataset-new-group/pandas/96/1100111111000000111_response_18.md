The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is responsible for applying custom business hours to a given datetime object with handling of holidays, but it is failing to work correctly with periods and adding holidays, as described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is related to the improper handling of holidays within the `apply` function. When holidays are provided, it produces more periods than expected in the output, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that should address the issue and pass the failing test:

```python
# import necessary modules
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# assume the existing related functions and classes as defined in the original code

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # existing functions and classes as defined in the original code

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # original code here
            # ... (all original code)
            # original code here

            # check if the day is a holiday
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # rest of the code remains the same          
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version includes additional logic to check if the day is a holiday and adjust the datetime accordingly.

With these modifications, the corrected `apply` function should properly handle holidays and return the expected number of periods, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
