Given the detailed expected values and types for each case provided, the bug seems to occur because the function is not properly adjusting the business hours and the datetime values when applying the custom business hour offset.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to re-implement the logic for adjusting the business hours and datetime values, possibly by breaking down the process into smaller, more manageable steps.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Extract time information
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other_time = datetime.time(other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

        # Check if the given time is within business hours
        if self._is_on_offset(other_time):
            return other

        # Calculate the start time for the next business hour
        next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate the number of business hours in a day
        business_hours_seconds = sum(
            (en - st).seconds for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        total_seconds = self.n * business_hours_seconds
        total_seconds, sign = (total_seconds, 1) if total_seconds >= 0 else (-total_seconds, -1)
        business_days = total_seconds // (24 * 3600)
        remaining_seconds = total_seconds % (24 * 3600)

        # Calculate the new datetime based on the business days and remaining hours
        new_date = next_opening_time + timedelta(sign * business_days)
        if remaining_seconds:
            remaining_hours = timedelta(seconds=sign * remaining_seconds)
            if sign > 0:
                new_date += self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time) - next_opening_time
                while remaining_hours > timedelta(0):
                    new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                    remaining_hours -= self._get_closing_time(new_date) - new_date
            else:
                remaining_hours = -remaining_hours if remaining_hours.total_seconds() != 0 else remaining_hours
                while remaining_hours > timedelta(0):
                    new_date = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_date))
                    remaining_hours -= new_date - self._next_opening_time(new_date)

        return new_date

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the buggy function should now satisfy all the provided test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
