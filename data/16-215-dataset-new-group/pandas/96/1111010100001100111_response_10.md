The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of `pandas.tseries.offsets` seems to be causing issues with `pd.date_range` when used with periods and adding holidays, resulting in more periods than expected.

After analyzing the runtime values, it seems that the bug might be occurring due to miscalculation in the `apply` function's logic when adjusting the business days and remaining business hours.

The issue stems from the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours when calculating the total number of periods. It appears that the adjustments are not being made correctly, which results in extra periods being included.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic related to adjusting business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. Additionally, handling the edge cases when the current time is on the edge of business hours could help in resolving the issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust timezone to UTC
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
        n = self.n

        offset_delta = self._get_offset_delta(other, n)

        # Adjust other using the offset delta
        other += offset_delta

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime using the `_get_offset_delta` method, which calculates the offset and adjusts the datetime accordingly. This approach should resolve the issue and ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range` with holidays and periods.
