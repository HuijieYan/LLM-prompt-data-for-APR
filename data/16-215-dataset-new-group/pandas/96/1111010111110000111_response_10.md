To fix the bug in the `apply` function that is causing the failing test, we need to adjust the logic for calculating business days and business hours. The error seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business days and hours when applying a custom business hour offset with holidays. 

When adding holidays, the custom business hour offset should adjust the date_range periods accordingly and not produce more periods than specified. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # modify the logic to respect holidays and custom business hours
            bm = self.rollforward(other)
            if bm in get_holidays():
                bm = self._next_opening_time(bm)
            
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                bm = self.rollforward(bm)
                if n > 0:
                    bm = self._next_opening_time(bm)
                else:
                    bm = self._prev_opening_time(bm)
            
            return bm
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function applies the custom business hour offset to the given datetime while respecting holidays and the direction of the adjustment. This will ensure that the date_range periods are correctly adjusted when adding holidays to the custom business hour offset.

With this correction, the failing test for `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass and the issue reported in the GitHub issue "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" should be resolved.
