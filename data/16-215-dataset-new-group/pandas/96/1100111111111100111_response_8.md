Based on the runtime input/output variable values and the failing test, it seems that the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the holidays correctly when computing the next business day.

The cause of the bug is that the adjustment for holidays is not being made correctly, leading to an incorrect result in cases where holidays are involved. The implementation is not taking into account the holidays when calculating the next opening time, resulting in an incorrect series of dates in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment for holidays is correctly incorporated into the calculation of the next business day.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import time for creating Date objects
import time

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

            # adjust other to take into account holidays
            while self._get_closing_time(other) in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # ... (remaining part of the function remains unchanged)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the above correction, the function should now correctly handle holidays and produce the expected output for the failing test.

By incorporating the adjustment for holidays when calculating the next business day, this correction aims to fix the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
