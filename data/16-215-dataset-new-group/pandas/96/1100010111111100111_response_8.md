The cause of the bug is that the CustomBusinessHour's `apply` method is not correctly accounting for holidays when calculating the business hours. As a result, the date range created using `pd.date_range` with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays produces incorrect results, leading to failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method needs to be updated to properly handle holidays and calculate the business hours accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_hours = self._create_business_hour_ranges(other)
        business_hours = self._adjust_for_holidays(business_hours)
        adjusted_datetime = self._adjust_datetime_for_business_hours(other, business_hours)
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `_create_business_hour_ranges` method is called to calculate the business hours based on the start and end times.
2. The `_adjust_for_holidays` method is called to adjust the business hours for any holidays included in the CustomBusinessHour.
3. The `_adjust_datetime_for_business_hours` method is called to adjust the input datetime to align with the business hours, accounting for holidays.

With these adjustments, the `apply` method should now correctly handle holidays and calculate the adjusted datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the date range creation with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays works as expected.
