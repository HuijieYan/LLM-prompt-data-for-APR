Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function is designed to adjust a given date and time value based on a specific business hour schedule. The function uses the logic to adjust a datetime object based on the business hours and business days.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it's evident that the function is failing to correctly adjust the datetime object according to the given business hours and days. Additionally, it seems that the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours is not producing the expected output.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve adjusting the logic for business day and business hour calculations to correctly handle both positive and negative adjustment values. Additionally, the conditional statements for handling whether a time is on or off the business offset need to be reviewed for accuracy.

Here's a corrected version of the function based on the provided information:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        if n >= 0:
            # adjust for positive n
            other_time = other.time()
            if other_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            remaining_hours = (other - datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])).total_seconds() / 3600
            remaining_business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(remaining_hours, businesshours // 3600)
            other = other + timedelta(days=remaining_business_days)
            
            if remaining_hours > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(hours=remaining_hours))
        else:
            # adjust for negative n
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                
            remaining_hours = (datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end[0]) - other).total_seconds() / 3600
            remaining_business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(remaining_hours, businesshours // 3600)
            
            if remaining_hours == 0 and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0:
                remaining_hours = businesshours / 3600
            
            other = other - timedelta(days=remaining_business_days)
            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(hours=remaining_hours)))
        
        return other
        # raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function focuses on adjusting the datetime object based on the given business hours and days, handling both positive and negative adjustment values appropriately. It also removes unnecessary variable manipulations, simplifying the logic for better maintainability.
