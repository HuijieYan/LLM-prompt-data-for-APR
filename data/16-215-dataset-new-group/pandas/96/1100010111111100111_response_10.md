### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and the handling of holidays in the code. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` creates a `CustomBusinessHour` object, `freq`, with a start time of '15:00' and a holiday on '2020-11-26'. When `pd.date_range()` is called with '2020-11-25 15:00' as the start time and 4 periods, it returns unexpected values due to the bugs in the `apply()` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

From the runtime input/output variable values provided, it appears that the `apply()` method fails to handle the holidays correctly, leading to incorrect calculations of business hours and dates.

The failing test returns incorrect values because the current implementation of the `apply()` method doesn't properly handle holidays and their impact on business hours. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by improving the logic within the `apply()` method to correctly calculate business hours while considering holidays. The method should also handle the datetime updates and adjustments more accurately based on the provided holidays. The adjustments of the start and end times based on business hours need to consider holidays and provide the expected output.

The updated implementation should specifically handle the case when the holiday falls within the desired date range and adjust the calculation accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the apply method
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Handle holidays
        holidays = self.holidays if self.holidays else []
        if isinstance(holidays, np.datetime64):
            holidays = [holidays]
            
        # Calculate business hours considering holidays
        business_hours = super().apply(other)
        
        # Adjust other based on business hours and holidays
        adjusted_other = other
        for _ in range(self.n):
            adjusted_other += timedelta(hours=1)
            while adjusted_other in holidays:
                adjusted_other += timedelta(hours=1)

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `apply()` method now checks for holidays and ensures that the adjusted datetime does not fall on a holiday.
2. It calculates business hours using the inherited `apply` method from the parent class.
3. It adjusts the datetime based on the calculated business hours and holidays.
4. It returns the adjusted datetime.

This corrected version should handle the holiday properly and ensure that the adjusted `DatetimeIndex` matches the expected values, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
