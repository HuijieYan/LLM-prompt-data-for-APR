The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class contains several potential error locations:

1. Incorrect handling of the `other` argument when adjusting for business hours.
2. The loop conditions and the logic inside the loops for adjusting business hours are incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function does not correctly adjust the business hours based on the input datetime. This leads to incorrect output when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function to correctly handle the business hours based on the input datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if n > 0:
                if bhour >= timedelta(minutes=0):
                    n -= 1
            else:
                if bhour <= timedelta(minutes=0):
                    n += 1
            other += self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) - other

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrections made to the `apply` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
