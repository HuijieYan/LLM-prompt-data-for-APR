The primary issue with the buggy function seems to be with the calculation and adjustment of business days and hours. It is producing unexpected results when trying to combine business hours with datetime values, as shown in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug could stem from the way the function handles adjustments for business days and remaining business hours. It appears that the conditions and adjustment logic within the function are not properly handling the combination of business hours with datetime values, leading to unexpected results.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the function. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the logic for handling holidays and ensuring that it aligns with the user's expectations in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust to business opening time if necessary
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            n = self.n
            if n > 0:
                # Adjust for forward business periods
                while n > 0:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)  # Move to the next hour
                    if other.time() in self.start and self.is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1  # Reduce remaining periods by 1

            elif n < 0:
                # Adjust for backward business periods
                while n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)  # Move to the previous hour
                    if other.time() in self.start and self.is_on_offset(other):
                        n += 1  # Increase remaining periods by 1

            return other
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Example usage
start = datetime(2020, 11, 25, 10, 0)
cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'])
business_mixin = BusinessHourMixin()

result = business_mixin.apply(start, cbh)
print(result)
```

In the corrected version of the function, adjustments for business days and hours are made based on the provided `CustomBusinessHour` and the input `datetime` values. The function now correctly checks for the start time and applies the necessary adjustments based on the direction of periods.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
