The cause of the bug is that the function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the input times based on the provided business hours. As a result, it is not generating the expected output.

The strategy to fix the bug is as follows:
1. Ensure that the input `other` is correctly adjusted to the nearest business time interval.
2. Calculate the total business hours in one business day.
3. Adjust the input based on the total business hours and the specified number of business days.
4. Repeat this adjustment process until the remaining business hours are zero.

The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    n += 1
            
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
            else:
                other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version implements the adjustments required for the provided business hours and should pass the failing test.
