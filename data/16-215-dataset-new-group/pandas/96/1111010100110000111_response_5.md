The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing a ValueError when using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and adding holidays. The issue posted in GitHub also confirms this behavior. The problem seems to be caused by the incorrect identification of weekends, which results in the incorrect generation of periods when holidays are added.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business hours based on holidays and weekends needs to be updated. In the buggy function, the logic for handling weekends and holidays does not account for the specific working hours and skips periods incorrectly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, Holiday

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Logic to adjust business hours based on holidays
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                if self.onOffset is not None:
                    self.onOffset = other
                return other
            else:
                next_open, next_close = self._nhc(np.datetime64(other))
                if pd.offsets.BDay().onOffset(next_open):
                    next_open = pd.offsets.BDay().apply(next_open)
                periods = self._apply_rule(next_open, next_close)
                periods = self._apply_holidays(periods, [])

            return pd.to_datetime(periods)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    # New private method to apply holidays
    def _apply_holidays(self, periods, holidays):
        if isinstance(holidays, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if self.onOffset is not None:
                self.onOffset = holidays
            holidays = [pd.to_datetime(h) for h in holidays]
        if len(holidays) < 1:
            return periods
        holidays = pd.DatetimeIndex(holidays).sort_values()
        for h in holidays:
            hit = np.where(h <= periods)[0]
            if len(hit) > 0:
                periods = np.delete(periods, hit[0])
        return periods
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` function now includes logic to handle adjusting business hours based on holidays. The updated `apply_holidays` method now accounts for holidays when generating periods, ensuring that the correct periods are returned when holidays are added.

By using the corrected version, the bug causing the `ValueError` should be fixed, and the `pd.date_range` function should work as expected when using periods and adding holidays.
