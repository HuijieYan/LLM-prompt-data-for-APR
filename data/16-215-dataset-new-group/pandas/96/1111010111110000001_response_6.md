The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the custom business hours when adjusting the datetime values. This is evident from the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file, along with the error message which indicates a ValueError related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The potential error locations in the `apply` function are likely related to the adjustments made to the datetime `other` based on the business hours and days, as well as the comparison and calculation of business hours.

The bug causes the custom business hours to not be correctly accounted for when adjusting the datetime values. This leads to the adjusted datetime values not reflecting the expected custom business hours, causing the test to fail.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and revise the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustments to the datetime values based on the custom business hours and days. Additionally, ensuring that the comparison and calculation of business hours accurately reflects the custom business hours defined in the test.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        offset = self.apply_offset(other)

        if n < 0:
            offset -= self.offset
        else:
            offset += self.offset

        return offset
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected `apply` function correctly handles the adjustments to the datetime values based on the custom business hours and offset, which should resolve the failing test.
