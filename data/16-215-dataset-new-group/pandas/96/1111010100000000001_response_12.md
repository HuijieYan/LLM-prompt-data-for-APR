Buggy function analysis:
The function has several potential error locations. It manipulates datetime objects based on certain business hour rules, and the manipulation process is complex and prone to logic errors. The function also compares timedeltas, which could lead to errors.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparisons and adjustments made to the datetime object within the business hour rules. It's also possible that the manipulation of timedeltas is causing unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Break down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable parts.
2. Use clear, concise variable names to improve readability.
3. Test each step of the manipulation process with various datetime inputs and different edge cases to ensure correct behavior.
4. Avoid taking the difference between datetime objects returned by different operations such as `_prev_opening_time` and `_next_opening_time`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        
        n = self.n
        
        # Check if it's within business hours and adjust if necessary
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), business_hours / 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version, I simplified and clarified the logic, replacing the potentially error-prone code with simpler, more readable alternatives. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or need additional assistance.
