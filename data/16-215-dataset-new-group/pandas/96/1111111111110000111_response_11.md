The bug in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class causes `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays. The changes in behavior arise from the special handling of the 'other' variable based on the provided business hour in the frequency.

The cause of the bug is in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable based on the business hour. Specifically, the adjustment logic for positive and negative `n` values is not handling the cases properly. This leads to incorrect adjustments of `other`, resulting in unexpected results in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for positive and negative `n` values in the `apply` method needs to be revised to correctly handle the adjustments to the `other` variable. This will ensure that the adjustments based on business hour are correctly applied, leading to the correct results in the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours within the specified period
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Next business time interval
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected `apply` method addresses the bug by revising the adjustment logic and business hour handling based on the positive and negative values in the `n` variable. This corrected method should ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied, resolving the issue and passing the failing test case.
