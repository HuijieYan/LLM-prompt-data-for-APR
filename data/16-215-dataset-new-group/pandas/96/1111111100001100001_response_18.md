The buggy function seems to be calculating business hours using the input parameters `other` and `self`. However, there are multiple issues that need to be addressed to fix the bug:

1. The function seems to be using time comparisons, but not taking into account the dates. It should consider both the date and time to accurately calculate business hours.

2. The conditional statements seem to be erroneously using logical operators, which may lead to incorrect conditional outcomes and time manipulations.

3. There is an inconsistent use of date and time objects, which could result in incorrect calculations and comparisons.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to review and adjust the logic being used to calculate business hours, ensuring that both the date and time are appropriately considered. Additionally, the conditional statements and logical operators should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions from the class)
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust date and time to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                (en - st).seconds
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self.end[0].replace(date=other.date(), tzinfo=other.tzinfo) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(1)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self.start[0].replace(date=other.date(), tzinfo=other.tzinfo)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that this corrected version of the function addressed the key issues identified and provided a simplified and more accurate way to calculate business hours based on the input parameters.
