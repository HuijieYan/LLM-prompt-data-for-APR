The buggy function applies an offset to a given datetime, adjusting it for business hours and days. However, the function contains several logical errors that cause it to produce incorrect results.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrect usage of the `self.next_bday` attribute, which should be accessed as `self.next_bday()` to call the method.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `other` datetime object, leading to unwanted changes and incorrect adjustments in the resulting output.
3. Incorrect comparison of timedelta values, leading to unexpected conditional branching.

The cause of the bug is related to the mismanagement of the `other` datetime object and inconsistent handling of business days and hours. As a result, the function produces incorrect adjusted datetime values, leading to non-conformant output for the given frequencies and periods.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the adjustments according to business hours and days, as well as the correct usage of class methods and attributes. Additionally, the conditional branching and comparisons need to be reviewed to ensure the accurate adjustment of the datetime object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import required packages
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

# Define the corrected apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Unchanged code

            # adjust by business days first - fixed usage of next_bday()
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust - removed duplicate code
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the fixed function, the problematic behavior identified in the failing test should be resolved, and the function should produce the expected output.
