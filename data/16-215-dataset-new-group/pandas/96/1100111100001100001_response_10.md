The buggy function `apply` is encountering issues due to incorrect handling of the `self.next_bday` attribute. This attribute should be accessed as an instance method `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` instead of just calling `self.next_bday` directly.

The `self.next_bday` attribute is an instance of the `CustomBusinessDay` class and should be accessed using the method `is_on_offset(other)`. This method is used to check whether a given timestamp `other` is on a business day.

Furthermore, the function does not handle the case where `other` may be a Pandas `Timestamp`, which can lead to errors during the datetime adjustments based on business days.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly access the `is_on_offset` method of the `self.next_bday` instance when determining if the timestamp `other` is on a business day.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (Existing code remains unchanged)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # (Remaining code remains unchanged)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Call method is_on_offset on instance of CustomBusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # (Remaining code remains unchanged)

``` 
In the corrected code, we've updated the calls to `self.next_bday` to use the method `is_on_offset` in the context of the current instance `CustomBusinessDay`. This ensures that the correct method is called to determine if the timestamp `other` is on a business day.
