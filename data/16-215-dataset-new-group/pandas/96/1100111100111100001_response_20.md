The bug in the buggy code is likely related to the adjustments made to the `other` parameter to reduce the number of cases to handle. Based on the input parameter values, it appears that the adjustments to `other` might not be correctly handled, resulting in the wrong date and time values generated by the function.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to carefully review the logic of adjusting the `other` parameter, ensuring that it correctly implements the intended adjustments based on the input values and the business hours. Additionally, the calculations for the remaining business hours and adjustments related to business days should be reviewed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate business days adjustment
        if n != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            other += skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n == 0 or bhour >= timedelta(0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += timedelta(hours=businesshours / 60 * n)
                    return other
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while n < 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if n == 0 or bhour <= timedelta(0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += timedelta(hours=businesshours / 60 * n)
                    return other
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised implementation should handle the adjustments to the `other` parameter correctly, considering the business hours, business days, and remaining business hours, and resolve the reported failure.
