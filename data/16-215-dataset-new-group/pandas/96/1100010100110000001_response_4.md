The error message is a `ValueError` which gives a hint that the bug is related to frequency validation of the given date offset.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the frequency validation part.

The cause of the bug is that the function seems to be misinterpreting the given frequency (CBH) with the inferred frequency (None).

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the given frequency.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyFrequencyError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency"
        )
```
