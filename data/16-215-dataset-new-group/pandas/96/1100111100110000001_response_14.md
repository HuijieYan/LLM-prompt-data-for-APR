The buggy code in the `apply` function is not handling the custom business hours correctly, leading to a ValueError in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case.

The cause of the bug is primarily the mishandling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `apply` function. The frequency of `CustomBusinessHour` is not properly being processed, which leads to the failure of the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case. Specifically, the frequency inferred from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.
The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `apply` function handles the `CustomBusinessHour` properly and adjusts the business hours according to the specified custom business hours.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# other imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# ... (other functions and classes)

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions in the class)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Datetime):
            # handle CustomBusinessHour frequency
            if isinstance(self, pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
                return self.rollforward(other + self)
            else:
                return self.apply_other_generic_case(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency specifically. We utilize the `rollforward` method to adjust the date to the next business hour according to the custom business hours specified. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
