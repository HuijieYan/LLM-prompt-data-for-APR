The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The handling of business day adjustment seems to be incorrect.
2. The adjustment of business hours also appears to be incorrect when the number of hours is negative.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly adjusting the business day and remaining business hours, resulting in incorrect output when applying the business hour offset to a given datetime.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.
2. Address the incorrect handling of negative business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain = bhour - bhour_remain
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(minutes=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of business days and remaining business hours to ensure that the function works as intended and outputs the correct result when applying the business hour offset to a given datetime.
