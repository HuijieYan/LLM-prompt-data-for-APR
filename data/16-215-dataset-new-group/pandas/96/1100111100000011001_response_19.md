The bug in the provided function is the dereferencing of a non-existent attribute "next_bday". Also, there are several missing method calls related to the "self" object. The expected input/output values and types are not met due to these bugs. The "next_bday" attribute is actually a method of the BusinessHourMixin class and should be called using self.next_bday(). Additionally, some of the methods of the BusinessHourMixin class are not being called correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other function declarations

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,

The corrected function ensures that the correct methods are called and the correct attributes are accessed to produce the expected output for the specified input cases.
