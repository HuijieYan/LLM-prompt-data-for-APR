The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is attempting to adjust the input `datetime` object based on business hours, but it fails to produce the correct output for certain cases, as evidenced by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The potential error locations within the buggy `apply` function are:
1. The logic for adjusting the input `datetime` object based on business hours.
2. Handling of positive and negative values for `n`.
3. Management of holidays or non-business days.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the input `datetime` object based on business hours is not correctly accounting for holidays, resulting in incorrect output when the custom business hours and holidays are involved.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve:
1. Including a check for holidays within the adjustment logic.
2. Refining the logic for adjusting the input `datetime` object based on the business hours and handling of positive and negative values for `n`.
3. Ensuring that the function produces the correct output even when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)
            if other in self.holidays:
                raise ValueError(f"{other} is a holiday.")

        n = self.n
        if self.on_offset(other):
            if n > 0:
                other = other + self.offset
            elif n < 0:
                other = other - self.offset

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self.offset_on_closest_business_hour(other, True)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self.offset_on_closest_business_hour(other, False)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes appropriate checks for holidays within the adjustment logic, refines the logic for adjusting the input `datetime` object based on business hours and handles the positive and negative values for `n` correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
