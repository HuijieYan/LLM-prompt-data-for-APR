# Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The buggy function applies a custom business hour offset to a datetime object, but there seem to be issues with the adjustments made to the datetime object based on the business hour offset, especially when holidays are involved.

# Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information
The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is attempting to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday. The expected result is that the date range should respect the custom business hour frequency and skip the specified holiday. However, the buggy function is not handling the holiday and the adjustments based on the business hour offset correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The GitHub issue further explains the problem by showing that when a holiday is added, the date range is producing more periods than specified, indicating that the adjustment for the holiday is not functioning as expected.

# Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the adjustments and calculations made in the buggy function related to holidays and business hour offsets need to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially re-implemented to ensure that adding a holiday does not affect the calculation of the date range periods.

# Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version
I will provide a corrected version of the `apply` function below:

```python
# Import necessary package
import pandas as pd

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        target_datetime = pd.Timestamp(other)
        target_date_start = target_datetime.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        # Calculate business hours for each day of the week
        total_business_hours = [self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)]
        
        business_days = (target_datetime - target_date_start).days
        full_weeks, remaining_days = divmod(business_days, 7)
        
        total_business_hours_weekly = sum(total_business_hours) * full_weeks
        
        # Calculate business hours for the remaining days
        daily_business_hours = sum([self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)])
        remaining_hours = daily_business_hours * remaining_days
        
        total_business_hours_target = total_business_hours_weekly + remaining_hours

        closing_times = [self._get_closing_time(target_date_start + pd.DateOffset(days=i)) for i in range(business_days)]
        
        # Skips the holiday if the target date is a holiday
        if target_datetime in self.holidays:
            business_days += 1
        
        target_business_hours = total_business_hours_target * n

        if n > 0:
            end_of_day = self._get_closing_time(target_datetime.replace(hour=23, minute=59, second=59))
            total_seconds = (end_of_day - target_datetime).total_seconds()
            if total_seconds < target_business_hours:
                business_days += 1
                remaining_hours = target_business_hours - total_seconds
                remaining_days += 1
                total_business_hours_target += daily_business_hours
                closing_times.append(self._get_closing_time(target_datetime))
        
        target_date_next = target_date_start + pd.DateOffset(days=business_days)
        
        total_seconds = 0
        i = 0
        while total_seconds < remaining_hours and i < len(closing_times):
            total_seconds += (closing_times[i] - target_datetime).total_seconds() if closing_times[i] > target_datetime else 0
            i += 1
        
        if total_seconds >= remaining_hours:
            target_datetime = closing_times[i - 1] + pd.Timedelta(seconds=remaining_hours)
        else:
            remaining_hours -= total_seconds
            i = 0
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                remaining_hours -= daily_business_hours
                i += 1

                if remaining_hours > 0:
                    target_date_next += pd.DateOffset(days=i)
        
            target_datetime = self._get_closing_time(target_date_next - pd.DateOffset(days=i) + pd.Timedelta(seconds=remaining_hours))

        return target_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for holidays and business hour offsets are recalculated to ensure proper handling. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
