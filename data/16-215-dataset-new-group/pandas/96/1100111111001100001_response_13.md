The buggy function has an issue in the logic of adjusting the time based on the business hours. The function is supposed to calculate the next business time based on the given input parameters, but it fails in some cases as evidenced by the failing tests.

Looking at the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, the expected result is not matching with the actual result. This indicates an issue with the logic inside the `apply` function.

The bug seems to be in the while loops where it tries to adjust the remaining business hours. The conditions and calculations inside these loops are incorrectly adjusting the time, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours needs to be reviewed and potentially re-implemented. 

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            while self.is_on_offset(other):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            while self.is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the given time based on the business hours and should now produce the correct results for the failing test.
