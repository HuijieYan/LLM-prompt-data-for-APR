The error message indicates that there is an issue with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency `CBH`. This implies that the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly adjusting the datetime values based on the provided frequency, leading to a discrepancy between the inferred and passed frequencies.

Upon analyzing the `apply` function, some potential error locations include:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the datetime values based on the provided frequency.
2. The division and modulo operations within the function might not be handling negative business hours correctly.
3. The adjustment and iteration logic for handling business hours within the function could be incorrect.

To fix this issue, it's important to review the logic of adjusting the datetime values based on the provided frequency, especially when dealing with negative business hours and the iteration over the business hours. It is also crucial to ensure that the adjusted datetime values conform to the specified frequency.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_dt = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start_hour, 0)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other < start_dt or other.minute > 0:
                other = start_dt
                n += 1

        else:
            if other > start_dt or other.minute > 0:
                other = start_dt
                n -= 1

        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_sum()
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n), business_hours)
        
        if n < 0:
            business_days = -business_days
            remaining_hours = -remaining_hours

        if business_days != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)
        
        if remaining_hours != 0:
            while remaining_hours != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                remaining_hours -= self._remaining_business_hours(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should handle the adjustment of datetime values, including consideration for positive and negative business hours. It should also ensure that the adjusted datetime values conform to the specified frequency. After applying these changes, the function should pass the failing test.
