The buggy function `apply` is meant to be applied to other datetime objects, and it is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the use of `pd.date_range` when adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The issue reports that using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays produces more periods than expected.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the handling of holidays and the adjustment of business days and hours within the `apply` function. It appears that the function does not correctly account for the holidays when adjusting the business days, leading to an incorrect number of periods in `pd.date_range`.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `apply` function to properly handle the holidays when adjusting the business days and hours. This may involve utilizing the holiday information provided in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and adjusting the date accordingly to ensure that holidays are skipped and the correct number of periods is returned.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        if not _is_normalized(other):
            # convert to local
            offset = other.utcoffset()
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None) - offset

        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.holidays is not None:
            holidays = [as_datetime(hol) for hol in self.holidays]
            holidays = [
                date(hol.year, hol.month, hol.day) for hol in holidays
            ]
            while other.date() in holidays:
                if n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By including the logic to handle holidays within the `apply` function, the corrected version ensures that the holidays are properly accounted for when adjusting the business days and hours.
