The issue seems to be related to the unexpected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding a holiday. The resulting output contains more periods than expected when holidays are added. The expected behavior should be that the date range produces the correct number of periods based on the input parameters. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holidays".

Based on the runtime variable values and types within the buggy function, it seems that the issue stems from the incorrect adjustment of business days and hours when a holiday is added, resulting in a subsequent incorrect frequency in the date range.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function for handling holidays should be revised to ensure that the correct number of business days and hours are accounted for, taking holidays into consideration.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # same as before
            # ...

            # check for holidays
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if holiday.date() == other.date():
                    other += timedelta(days=1)  # move to the next day

            # same as before
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, a loop has been added to check for holidays, and if the date matches a holiday, the function adds a day to the date to skip the holiday and maintain the expected frequency.

This revision to the `apply` function should resolve the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test, and also address the GitHub issue related to adding holidays and the resulting date range output.
