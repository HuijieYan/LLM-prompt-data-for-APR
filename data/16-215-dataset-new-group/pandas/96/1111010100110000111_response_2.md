## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas library. It's used to apply business hour offsets to a datetime or a timestamp. The function uses various conditional checks and date operations to calculate the adjusted datetime. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when using `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adding holidays, more than the specified number of periods are being produced.

## Potential Error Locations
The `apply` function contains several conditional checks, datetime adjustments, and mathematical calculations. The error could be related to any of these areas, such as the adjustment of business days, adjustment of business hours, or conditional checks related to holidays.

## Cause of the Bug
The error message from the failing test indicates a `ValueError`, stating "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH". This indicates that the frequency derived from the passed values is not compatible with the frequency that was passed. This could be due to incorrect adjustments of business days, hours, or other business holiday checks in the `apply` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
In order to fix this bug, the adjustments for business days and hours need to be thoroughly reviewed, and edge cases with holidays should be handled accurately. Additionally, the conditional checks related to holidays and their effect on the frequency need to be validated and adjusted accordingly. It's also important to ensure that the inferred frequency aligns with the passed frequency when holidays are accounted for.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businessdays = self._get_business_days()
            
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other in businessdays:
                        n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    if other in businessdays:
                        n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function simplifies the adjustments for business days and hours. It also ensures that the proper frequency inference and holiday checking related to the frequency are maintained. With this correction, the reported issue on GitHub should be resolved.
