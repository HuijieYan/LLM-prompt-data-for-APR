The buggy function is failing the test due to the incorrect calculation of the `businesshours`. This calculation causes the function to produce incorrect results, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `businesshours` needs to be revised. Also, it seems that the adjustment of `other` based on business days and remaining business hours should be reviewed for accuracy.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, time

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # Convert other to a datetime object with timezone and nanosecond reset
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other based on the value of n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                (en.hour - st.hour) * 3600 + (en.minute - st.minute) * 60
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
