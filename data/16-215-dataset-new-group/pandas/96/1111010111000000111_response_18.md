The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the date_range with CustomBusinessHour to produce more periods than expected when adding holidays, as described in the GitHub issue "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The business hours adjustment process within the apply function.
2. The adjustment to move to the previous business day and the adjustment to the next opening time.

The cause of the bug is that the current logic in the apply function does not handle the addition of holidays correctly, resulting in more periods than expected when generating the date_range with CustomBusinessHour.

To fix the bug, a possible strategy would involve revisiting the logic in the apply function to properly account for holidays when handling the adjustment of business hours and when moving to the previous or next opening time.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # function to check if a given datetime is a holiday
        def is_holiday(dt):
            return dt.date() in self.holidays

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        while is_holiday(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_day_freq = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay()
            other = other + bd * business_day_freq

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment process and moves to the previous or next opening time based on the presence of holidays, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
