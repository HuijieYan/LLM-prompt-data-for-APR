Looking at the buggy function and the tests, it seems that the failure is due to incorrect logic in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The primary issue appears to be the incorrect handling of business hours and adjustments to the datetime based on the business hours.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime variable based on business hours is incorrect. This causes the function to return incorrect results when applied to a datetime index, leading to the failure of the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the input datetime (`other`) based on the business hours (`self`). The adjustments should account for the business day and remaining business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class CustomBusinessHour:
    # ... (other methods)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start[0])
                    elif other.time() > self.end[0]:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                elif not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other.time() > self.end[0]:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these corrections to the logic, the `apply` function should now return the expected results and pass the failing tests.
