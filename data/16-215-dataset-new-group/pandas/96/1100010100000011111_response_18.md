The buggy function seems to be `apply` from the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function is designed to apply custom business hours to a given datetime object. However, the provided cases indicate that the function is not returning the expected datetime values. This is causing issues for pandas users when using `date_range` in combination with custom business hours, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and business hours, as well as the handling of negative offsets.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the improper adjustment of business days and hours, which is affecting the expected output. Additionally, the behavior of the function with negative offsets might not be accurately implemented, causing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for adjusting business days and hours, as well as ensure proper handling of negative offsets. Additionally, we should also ensure that the `apply` function aligns with the behavior expected by users when using `date_range`.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # Adjust for positive or negative offset
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # adjustment for negative offsets
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n += 1
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure that the output aligns with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
