The bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays. The bug is related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and hours using the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the adjustment and calculation of business days and hours, leading to the unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function for users trying to generate date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of business days and hours should be carefully reviewed and potentially re-implemented to ensure the correct behavior when using periods and adding holidays.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        # Adjust other to the next opening time
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        while self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
        
        # Adjust other to the next business day if it's a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + self.next_bday.apply(remain)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments for holidays and business days are made more explicitly to ensure correct behavior. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the `pd.date_range` function work as expected with the `CustomBusinessHour` class and holidays.
