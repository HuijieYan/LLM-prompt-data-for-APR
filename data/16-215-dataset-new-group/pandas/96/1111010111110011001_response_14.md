The cause of the bug in the provided `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is that there are issues with the logic for adjusting the input `datetime` object. There are several conditional and looping blocks that affect the value of the `other` variable, but the handling of the adjustment calculations is not working as expected.

Given the various use cases and expected output values, the logic within these conditional and looping blocks has to be reviewed and corrected. The main issue appears to be in the while loops where the adjustment of time intervals occurs based on the value of `n`.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
                        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised version addresses the issues observed in the buggy function and is expected to pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values. It reformulates the adjustments and business hours calculations to handle the given scenarios appropriately.
