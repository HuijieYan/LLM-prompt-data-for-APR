The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is that it fails to account for holidays when calculating business hours. This results in the incorrect number of periods being generated, as highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function should be modified to include a check for holidays and adjust business hours accordingly. When a holiday is encountered, the function should skip the holiday and resume the business hours calculation on the next available business day.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # Skip holidays
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # resume regular business hours calculation
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # ... (remaining code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this fix, the `apply` function now takes holidays into account when calculating business hours. This modification addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the correct number of periods is generated even when holidays are present.
