In the corrected version of the buggy function, the basic structure and logic remain unchanged. However, several adjustments were made to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue:

1. Improved the `apply` function execution, which had an issue with handling the number of business days and business hours remaining. The `divmod` function was used to correctly calculate the business days and remaining hours, and the logic for updating the `other` datetime variable was adjusted accordingly.
2. Adjusted the error handling to ensure that the ApplyTypeError is raised only when the condition `isinstance(other, datetime)` is not met, as intended.

These changes address the reported issue, ensuring that the output values and types align with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue and the related test cases.
