Based on the provided information, it appears that the buggy function is failing to account for holidays when calculating the date range. Additionally, it doesn't handle the adjustment for holidays when the other datetime parameter is within a holiday. 

The cause of the bug is that the logic to handle holidays is insufficient, resulting in incorrect offsets when dealing with business hours and holidays. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly account for holidays, and adjust the date based on the holiday logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nadate, other = other, as_datetime(dt, maybe_cast=True)
        n = self.n
        ...

        if is_on_offset(nadate):
            nbdays = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            nadate = next_bday(nadate)
            while nbdays != 0:
                if is_on_offset(nadate):
                    nbdays -= np.sign(n)
                if nbdays != 0:
                    nadate = next_bday(nadate)
        return nadate
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version incorporates better logic for handling holidays and correctly adjusts the date based on the holiday logic.

By implementing the changes mentioned above, the modified function should properly handle holidays and fix the issue identified in the GitHub post.
