Multiple issues in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class have led to the failing test.

1. In the calculation of the `other` variable, there's a direct assignment of `other` without considering it as a timestamp. This is inconsistent with how `other` is being used later in the function.

2. There's inconsistency and incorrect handling in the adjustment of `other` based on the value of `n`.

3. Incorrect handling of the adjustment of the business days (`skip_bd`) when `n` signifies a negative value.

4. The calculation of business hours and the adjustment of `other` based on the remaining business hours also seems incorrect.

To fix the bug:
- Ensure `other` is always converted to a proper `datetime` object at the beginning of the function.
- Review the conditional statements and the adjustment of `other` considering the value of `n`.
- Review the adjustment of business days (`skip_bd`) and the calculation of remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ensure other is a proper datetime object
        if hasattr(other, "nanosecond"):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
        else:
            other = as_datetime(other)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self.get_next_business_hour(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self.get_previous_business_hour(other)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected method takes into account the proper handling of `other` and the conditions needed for the adjustments based on the value of `n`. Note that you may need to adjust the method names (`get_next_business_hour`, `get_previous_business_hour`, etc.) according to the actual method names available in the original class.
