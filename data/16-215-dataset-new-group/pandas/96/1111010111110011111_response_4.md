The primary issue with the `apply` function in the provided `BusinessHourMixin` class is that it does not correctly handle the case when a `CustomBusinessHour` includes holidays. As a result, the `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` fails to produce the expected output.

The buggy function does not properly adjust for holidays when calculating the business hours for a given period. As a result, the date range ends up with more periods than expected due to holidays not being properly counted.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles holidays by adjusting the business hours based on the presence of holidays.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n

            # Get the total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Adjust for holidays
            holidays = frozenset(self.holidays)
            periods = pd.date_range(start=other, end=other, freq="B").tolist()
            offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
                start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=holidays
            )
            holidays_hours = 0
            for p in periods:
                # Calculate the amount of time from the previous holiday
                delta = (p.replace(second=0, microsecond=0) - p.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)).total_seconds() / 3600
                holidays_hours += (business_hours // 3600) * delta

            if n >= 0:
                # Calculate the number of increments to move forward
                increments = n + (n // len(self.end)) * len(holidays)
                result = other
                for _ in range(increments):
                    result = result + offset
            else:
                # Calculate the number of increments to move backward
                increments = n - (n // len(self.start)) * len(holidays)
                result = other
                for _ in range(-increments):
                    result = result - offset

            return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected `apply` function, the issue with the failing test case for `pd.date_range` using `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays should be resolved. The corrected function now properly adjusts for holidays when calculating business hours and should produce the expected output.

Please note that this is a sample fixed version of the function, and it may need further validation and testing.
