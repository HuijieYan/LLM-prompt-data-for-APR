The buggy function has issues related to its execution logic and incorrect method calls. It appears to be using some methods that may not exist or may not be used correctly. 

There are numerous potential error locations within the buggy function including:
- Incorrect usage of method calls such as `self._next_opening_time`, `self._prev_opening_time`, `self._get_business_hours_by_sec`, `self._get_closing_time`, and `self.next_bday.is_on_offset`.
- Misuse of conditions and business hour adjustments that may result in incorrect output.
- Improper handling of datetime objects and their attributes.
- Unnecessary code complexity and overuse of loops.

The cause of the bug could be a combination of incorrect method calls, misuse of conditions, and improper handling of datetime objects leading to undesired behavior. 

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
- Reviewing the usage of all the method calls and ensuring that they exist and are called with correct parameters.
- Simplifying the logic and conditions to make the code more readable and understandable.
- Checking the handling of datetime objects and their attributes for correctness and proper handling.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on simplified logic and usage of the appropriate methods from the related classes. This should hopefully address the potential bugs and issues in the original buggy function.
