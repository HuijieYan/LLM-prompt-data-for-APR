The buggy function has issues related to adjusting the business hours for a given timestamp. The bug presents issues in the calculation of business days and remaining business hours to adjust.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect adjustments for business days, particularly at the edges of business days.
2. Issues with handling remaining business hours to adjust for positive and negative values of `n`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle edge conditions for business days and remaining hours, leading to incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Correctly handle adjustments for business days, ensuring that the timestamp is moved to the correct business day when necessary.
2. Properly handle remaining business hours to adjust, considering both positive and negative values of `n`.

Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond

                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,

                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):

            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:

                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
    
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # Finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # Go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version of the function, adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are properly handled for both positive and negative values of `n`.
