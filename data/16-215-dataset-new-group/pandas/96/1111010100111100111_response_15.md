The buggy function is causing the failing tests due to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime object, which leads to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function, as described in the GitHub issue. 

The root cause of the bug is that the adjustment logic for the `other` datetime object inside the `apply` function is not working as expected. This results in an incorrect number of periods being added, causing the failing tests as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be revised to accurately handle the adjustment of the input datetime object.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            if self.n >= 0:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return self._prev_opening_time(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic is simplified to handle the cases where the `other` datetime object is not on the offset. It directly handles the adjustment by returning the next or previous opening time based on the value of `self.n`.

This should resolve the bug and make the failing tests pass, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
