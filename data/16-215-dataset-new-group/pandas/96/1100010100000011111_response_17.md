To fix the buggy function, we need to address several issues related to the incorrect calculation and handling of business days and hours. The buggy function appears to be mishandling certain edge cases related to business hours and holidays. The issue is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of business days and hours when dealing with holidays.

To resolve the bug, we need to make adjustments to the logic for handling business hours, business days, and holidays, as well as the calculation of total business hours for a given time interval. It seems that the business hours and business days are not being properly adjusted, resulting in incorrect output.

Additionally, the code for adjusting the number of business days and business hours seems to be overly complex and may benefit from simplification and refactoring to improve clarity and maintainability.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n

        opening_times = [dt.time() for dt in self.start]
        closing_times = [dt.time() for dt in self.end]

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in closing_times or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in opening_times:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining_time = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remaining_time
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening_time) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour) and other.nanosecond != 0:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have made adjustments to the logic for business day and business hour adjustments, simplifying the code and addressing edge cases that were not properly handled in the original function. We also improved the clarity and maintained consistency with the expected input/output values and types specified in the GitHub issue.

Please note that the corrected function has not been tested in the development environment. It should be thoroughly tested with various test cases to ensure its correctness.
