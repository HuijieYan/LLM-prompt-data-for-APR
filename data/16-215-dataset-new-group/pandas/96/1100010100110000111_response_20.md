### Analysis:
The error message and the GitHub issue provided indicate that the bug is associated with the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding a holiday. The error message specifically mentions that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH".

### Error in the Buggy Function:
The apply function is calculating the business hours incorrectly, leading to issues when generating a range of dates.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours, which results in an incorrect frequency inferred when generating date ranges.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the calculation and adjustment of business hours.
2. Ensure that the frequency inferred after applying CustomBusinessHour is consistent with the intended frequency.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        # Original code had some business hour calculations which are removed
        other = as_datetime(other)

        if self._is_on_weekend(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(int((other - other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)).total_seconds()), businesshours // 60)

        if r < 0:
            # Adjust the business day downwards if negative time
            bd -= 1
            r -= businesshours // 60
        delta = timedelta(days=int(bd))
        other = self.next_bday.apply(other + delta, roll="forward")

        # This block ensures that the frequency inferred from the adjusted datetime conforms to the defined frequency CBH
        inferred = other + self - other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        if inferred.freq != self:
            raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred.freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {self}")

        return other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed CustomBusinessHour frequency when using `pd.date_range`.
