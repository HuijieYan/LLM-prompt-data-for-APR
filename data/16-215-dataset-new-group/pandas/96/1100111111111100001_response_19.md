Looking at the failing test function and the buggy function, it appears that the implementation of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the failure.

The failing test is related to the use of `CustomBusinessHour` in the `freq` parameter of the `pd.date_range` function. The test is intended to generate a date range based on a custom business hour with specific start time and holidays.

The actual `apply` function performs operations to handle business hours based on the input parameters, but there seems to be an issue with the logic, as it is causing the test to fail.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and examining the function logic, it seems that there are multiple issues with the logic and handling of business hours, including the adjustment of datetime, calculation of business hours, and handling of business days.

Based on the analysis, the errors are potentially caused by incorrect handling of business days, adjustments, and remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to review the logic of the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly handles the provided business hours and holidays, adjusts the datetime appropriately, and calculates remaining business hours accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    original_time = other.time()

    if original_time >= self.start and original_time < self.end:
        return other  # It's already within business hours

    elif self.n >= 0:
        while True:
            other += timedelta(hours=1)
            if other.time() >= self.start and other.time() < self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
    else:
        while True:
            other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            if other.time() >= self.start and other.time() < self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
```

By restructuring the conditional checks and using a while loop for the adjustments, the corrected code should handle the business hours and holidays correctly.

With the corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the custom business hours should be successfully applied to generate the expected date range.
