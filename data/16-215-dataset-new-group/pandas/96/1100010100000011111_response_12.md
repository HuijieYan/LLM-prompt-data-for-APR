## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the pandas library, specifically in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. It is used to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime input. The function contains several conditionals and calculations to adjust the input datetime based on the business hour offset.
The GitHub issue reported that using `pd.date_range` with the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays results in unexpected behavior, producing more periods than expected.
The `apply` function manipulates the input datetime based on the business hour offset, and it is likely that the incorrect adjustments are causing the issue with `pd.date_range` when handling holidays.

## Code Issues
1. The function contains complex conditional logic and datetime manipulations, which could lead to errors in calculating the correct business hours and offsets.
2. The adjustment for holidays and custom business hours may not be appropriately handled, leading to discrepancies in the number of periods when using `pd.date_range`.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `apply` function can lead to incorrect adjustments of the input datetime when using custom business hours and holidays. This can result in discrepancies when using `pd.date_range` to generate date ranges based on the adjusted business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for handling holidays and custom business hours to ensure the correct adjustment of the input datetime.
2. Refactor the conditional logic and datetime manipulations in the `apply` function to make it more readable and maintainable, reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # handle holidays
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and self.holidays is not None:
            holidays = [datetime.strptime(h, '%Y-%m-%d') for h in self.holidays]
            if other in holidays:
                return None  # skip the holiday

        # adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset
        if n >= 0:
            # handle positive offset
            adjustment = 0
        else:
            # handle negative offset
            adjustment = -1
        
        # apply the business hour offset to the datetime
        return other + DateOffset(hours=n, minutes=adjustment*60)

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the bug-fixed version, the `apply` function handles holidays and adjusts the datetime based on the business hour offset. The refactored logic should ensure correct adjustments and prevent discrepancies when using `pd.date_range`.
