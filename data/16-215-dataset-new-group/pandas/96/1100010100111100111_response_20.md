The cause of the bug is within the apply function. This function is designed to operate on a Timestamp value, but the algorithm has a logic issue that arises when the frequency specified by the CustomBusinessHour object results in more periods than expected when holidays are included.

The bug resides in the logic that handles the adjustment of business days and business hours. When altering the original time stamp to consider holidays and custom business hours, the function generates an unexpected number of periods.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic that handles the adjustment of business days and business hours in the apply function. Instead of relying solely on datetime calculations, we should consider using the functionality available in the pandas library to handle custom business hours and holidays efficiently.

Here's the corrected version of the apply function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, DateOffset, _offset
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        n = self.n

        # shift using DateOffset
        adjusted_time = other + n * DateOffset(hours=1)
        
        # consider holidays and custom business hours using pandas function
        adjusted_time = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start_time, holidays=self.holidays).apply(adjusted_time)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the pandas DateOffset and CustomBusinessHour functions, we can apply the necessary adjustments to the input Timestamp, taking into account the custom business hours and holidays. The corrected function should now handle the edge cases that were causing the unexpected periods in the output.

This fix leverages the existing functionality within the pandas library to handle custom business hours and holidays, resulting in a more robust and accurate adjustment process.
