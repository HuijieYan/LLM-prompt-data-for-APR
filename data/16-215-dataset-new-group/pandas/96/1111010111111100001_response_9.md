The bug in the function is causing a ValueError when running the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The cause of the bug is that the `apply` function fails to properly calculate the next business day and time. This leads to incorrect results when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, which causes the ValueError when attempting to create the expected DatetimeIndex in the test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for adjusting business hours and business days in the `apply` function. Particularly, the code for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours may need to be revised to ensure correct calculations.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = self._add_n_business_days(bd, other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments to the calculations and making sure the business days are correctly handled, the corrected `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
