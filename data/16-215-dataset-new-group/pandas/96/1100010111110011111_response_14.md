The bug in the `apply` function within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the `pd.date_range` function to behave unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays. The error message from the failing test indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. The expected input and output variables for specific cases are also provided.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the calculations involving `bd` and `bhour_remain`.

The cause of the bug is related to the adjustment of `bd` and `bhour_remain` based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. The incorrect adjustments lead to unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.

To fix the bug, proper adjustments should be made to `bd` and `bhour_remain` based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # ... (other code remains the same)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other - bhour)
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the `pd.date_range` function should work as expected when using periods and adding holidays, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
