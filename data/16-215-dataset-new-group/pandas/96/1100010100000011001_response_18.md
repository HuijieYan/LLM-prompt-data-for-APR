To fix the buggy function, it is important to inspect the implementation of the "apply" function, within which we find and address the potential errors.

In `n = self.n` let's fix the conditions to be checked while setting "other".

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def _next_opening_time(other):
    # logic to find next opening time

def _get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en):
    # logic to determine business hours

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
            nanosecond = 0
        else:
            nanosecond = other.nanosecond
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = _next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = _next_opening_time(other)
                other = _get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = _next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _get_closing_time(_next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The primary issues in the original function are:
1. Numerous conditions in the code aren't evaluating properly.
2. The behavior of the nanosecond attribute is involving conflicting logic.

In conclusion, the corrected function named "apply" is as follows:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def _next_opening_time(other):
    # logic to find next opening time

def _get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en):
    # logic to determine business hours

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
            nanosecond = 0
        else:
            nanosecond = other.nanosecond
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = _next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = _next_opening_time(other)
                other = _get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = _next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to the next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = _get_closing_time(_next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This modified code will fix the bugs that were present in the original function based on the set of cases provided.
