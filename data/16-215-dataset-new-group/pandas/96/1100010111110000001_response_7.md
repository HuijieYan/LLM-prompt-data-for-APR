The buggy function mentioned above is the `apply` function from the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is intended to apply a custom business hour frequency to a datetime object. 

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and expected index, but it fails with a `ValueError` due to an incorrect inferred frequency.

Upon analysis, it appears that the bug stems from the incorrect adjustment of the input `datetime` object based on the business hour frequency. 

The function should correctly calculate the business hours and adjust the `other` datetime object accordingly. However, it seems that the calculations are not handling the custom business hour frequency properly, leading to an incorrect output datetime.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and corrected to accurately handle the custom business hour frequencies. 

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

    return other

```

The corrected function above should address the issues with the adjustment logic and handle the custom business hour frequency properly. This should enable the function to pass the failing test and avoid the `ValueError`.
