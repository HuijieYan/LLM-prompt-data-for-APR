The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The issue is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` not working as expected when used with `pd.date_range` and when adding holidays. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` confirms the issue by showing that the output is more than the expected 4 periods when holidays are added.

The cause of the issue in the `apply` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the `other` datetime object when adding holidays. This leads to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when used with `CustomBusinessHour`.

To fix the bug, we can modify how the `other` datetime object is handled when adding or adjusting for holidays. Then we can create a corrected version of the `apply` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # handle holidays
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and self.holidays is not None and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # rest of the function remains unchanged
            # ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

In the corrected version, we have added logic to handle holidays specifically within the `apply` function. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test case pass.
