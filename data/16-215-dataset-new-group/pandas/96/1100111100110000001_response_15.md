It seems that the buggy code is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, which is a custom business hour from 15:00 to 17:00. The error occurred in a test for `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`. 
The error message provides a clue that the issue is likely due to an invalid frequency as the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

In the buggy function, one potential error is in the logic for adjusting the passed datetime (`other`). This logic involves several conditional statements and updates to the `other` variable based on various conditions. It's possible that a miscalculation is leading to an incorrect adjustment of the datetime, resulting in the discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

Another potential error is the use of the `next_bday` attribute, which is incorrectly accessed as an attribute of the `self` object instead of calling the method.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for adjusting the passed datetime and verify that it accurately handles the specified business hour offset. Additionally, the use of the `next_bday` attribute should be modified to correctly call the method, and any other conditional statements or variable updates should be reviewed for accuracy.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
