The buggy function fails to correctly handle business hours when adjusting a given datetime, leading to incorrect outputs in the failing tests. The issue appears to stem from the logic used to adjust the datetime for business hours and business days.

The buggy function modifies the input datetime 'other' based on certain business hour rules, but it seems to produce incorrect results in various cases. The incorrect logic is evident from the inconsistent adjustment of 'other' as well as the assumptions made about the business hours and business days.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the input datetime 'other' needs to be thoroughly reviewed and revised. The logic for adjusting the business days and business hours should be reconsidered, ensuring that it accurately reflects the intended behavior of the CustomBusinessHour class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods from the class remain unchanged

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and focuses on accurately adjusting the input datetime 'other' based on the business hour rules. It avoids unnecessary manipulations and ensures that the adjustments align with the intended behavior of the CustomBusinessHour class. With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests provided.
