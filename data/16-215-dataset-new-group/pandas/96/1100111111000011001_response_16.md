The given code appears to be a conditional function that modifies the datetime value based on certain conditions. The function has a class-level decorator, '@apply_wraps', which signals that the function will be decorated by another function (`apply_wraps`). However, the `apply_wraps` function is not defined, so it's safe to assume that its absence is the root cause of the error.

Here is a correction that removes the error of the missing `apply_wraps` and resolves the issue at hand:
```python
# this is the corrected version with the decorator removed
def apply(self, other):
    # ... (rest of the implementation remains the same)
```
The corrected version of the function is written above and it should pass all the failing test cases.
