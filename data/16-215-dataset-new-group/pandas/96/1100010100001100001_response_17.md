The bug in the given function causes incorrect adjustments to be made to the datetime input based on the calculated business days and remaining business hours, which leads to unexpected output. The adjustments fail to accurately handle both positive and negative values of `self.n`.

To fix the bug, it's important to correctly adjust the datetime based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, the conditions and logic for adjusting the datetime need to be accurately handled based on the sign of `self.n` and other related variables.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        total_minutes = self.n * 60
        businessdays, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(total_minutes), businesshours // 60)

        if total_minutes < 0:
            businessdays, remaining_minutes = -businessdays, -remaining_minutes

        # Adjust by business days first
        if businessdays != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=businessdays)
            if businessdays > 0:
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() not in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if remaining_minutes != 0:
            current_time = other.time()
            if self.n >= 0:
                while remaining_minutes > 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(next_open) - other.replace(hour=next_open.hour, minute=next_open.minute)
                    if remaining_minutes < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        remaining_minutes = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = next_open
            else:
                while remaining_minutes > 0:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = other.replace(hour=prev_open.hour, minute=prev_open.minute) - prev_open
                    if remaining_minutes < bhour.total_seconds() // 60 or (remaining_minutes == bhour.total_seconds() // 60 and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        remaining_minutes = 0
                    else:
                        remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(prev_open)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the above changes, the function has been corrected to accurately adjust the `other` datetime based on the number of business days and remaining business hours, and correctly handle both positive and negative values of `self.n`. This should resolve the previous issues and produce the expected results for various scenarios.
