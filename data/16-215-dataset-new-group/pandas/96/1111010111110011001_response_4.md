The buggy function has issues with its logic and calculations relating to business hours. The failing test is related to a CustomBusinessHour frequency class.

Here are the potential error locations in the buggy function based on the failing test:
1. In the case when n is positive and `other.time()` is in `self.end` or not on a business hour offset.
2. In the case when n is negative and `other.time()` is in `self.start`.
3. The logic of adjusting business days and hours might encounter issues with incorrect calculation of business days when adjusting time.

The cause of the bug is that the logic used for adjusting the business hours and days for different time intervals within the function is not handling the adjustments correctly. This leads to the output values not matching the expected values for the failing test case.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve reviewing and correcting the logic used to handle adjustments for business days and hours. In addition, it may be necessary to check the calculations made within the function to ensure its correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessMixin
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            # Additional check for midnight business hour
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            while r != 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
