The bug in the given function is that when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', a new background is created and the original image is pasted onto it. However, the index values of the paste function are not correct. 

The cause of the bug is that the paste function is called with the `image` object as the first argument. It should be called with (0, 0) as the first argument to specify the position where the pasted image should start.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function by correcting the index values while pasting and converting the image.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
