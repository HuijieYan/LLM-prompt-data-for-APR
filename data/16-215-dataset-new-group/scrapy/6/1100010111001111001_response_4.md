The bug in the `convert_image` function is that when dealing with images in RGBA format, the function is not appropriately handling transparency. 

In Case 1, the input image is in JPEG format and RGB mode, so it should not face any transformation. However, the function is unnecessarily processing the image. 

In Case 2, the input image is still in RGB mode. After calling the `thumbnail` method with the size of (10, 25), the resulting image is expected to have the mode 'RGB' and size (10,10), but the provided implementation is failing to produce the expected result.

In Case 3, the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. The function should remove transparency and convert the image to RGB mode, but it only changes the mode without addressing transparency.

In Case 4, the input image is in PNG format and palette (P) mode with transparency. The function should have transparent areas changed to the background color, but it fails to handle transparency correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle all types of transparency by converting RGBA images to RGB and dealing with transparency appropriately. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the thumbnail resize operation more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now handle RGBA images correctly, handling transparency and converting them to RGB as required. Additionally, the thumbnail operation should maintain the correct aspect ratio and produce the expected results for all test cases.
