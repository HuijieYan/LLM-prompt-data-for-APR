## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function seems to have a bug related to converting PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB mode.

The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of both JPEG and PNG images and also checks whether thumbnails maintain the image ratio. It is expected to pass for both JPEG and PNG images.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not be triggering the expected conversion.
2. The conversion logic and thumbnail generation may not be working as expected for PNG images with RGBA mode.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be related to the PNG image with an RGBA mode not being converted to RGB as expected. This could be due to a condition that doesn't trigger the required conversion or incorrect conversion logic.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add a new condition to explicitly check for PNG images with an RGBA mode for the required conversion.
2. Update the conversion logic to properly convert PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Change RGBA to RGB mode
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Specify the paste position
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By changing the background mode to RGB when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode and specifying the paste position, the conversion should work as expected for both JPEG and PNG images.
