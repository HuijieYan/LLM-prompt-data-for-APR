The buggy function `convert_image` fails the `test_convert_image` test because it does not correctly handle images with the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA'. It fails to properly handle transparency and convert RGBA images to RGB as expected by the test.

The cause of the bug is that when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA background and pastes the original image on it. However, the pasting operation is incorrect and the conversion to RGB is incorrect as well.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle RGBA images by converting the RGBA background correctly and then pasting the original image on it. Additionally, the function should ensure that the image format is 'JPEG' after conversion from RGBA to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function ensures that the RGBA background is correctly created and the original image is correctly pasted on it. It also ensures that the image format is 'JPEG' after conversion from RGBA to RGB.
