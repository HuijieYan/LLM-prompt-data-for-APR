The issue in the `convert_image` function is likely in the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is creating a new background, pasting the original image onto it, and then converting it to RGB. However, this process is not correctly preserving the transparency of the original image. This is causing the failing test for images with transparency to produce incorrect results and validation errors.

To fix this issue, the strategy would be to ensure that when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the transparency is preserved in the converted image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # convert the RGBA image to RGB without altering transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, when the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, we directly convert the image to RGB without altering its transparency. This approach ensures that transparency is preserved during the conversion process.

After making this correction, the failing test for images with transparency should pass, and the issue with the failing validation error should be resolved.
