The buggy function has several potential error locations, including:
1. The conditional statements to check the format and mode of the image may not be handling all possible cases properly.
2. The background.paste(image, image) line is not functional, and could be causing an error when trying to paste the original image onto the new background.
3. The image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS) line may not be resizing the image correctly.


The causes of the bugs are as follows:
- In case 1, the conditional statement can fail to properly handle all cases where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
- In case 2, the code needs to correctly size the image to the provided size without distortion or corruption.
- In case 3, the function does not handle the conversion correctly when the image mode is not 'RGB'.
- In case 4, the code needs to correctly convert the image to RGB mode when necessary.


To fix these bugs, we can use the following strategy:
1. Replace the conditional statements with a more comprehensive check for image formats and modes.
2. Use the resize() method instead of the problematic paste() and thumbnail() methods.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and types for all the provided test cases.
