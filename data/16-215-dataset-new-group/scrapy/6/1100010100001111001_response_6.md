The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed. 
Firstly, the logic inside the condition block for PNG format images with RGBA mode is incorrect. It attempts to create a new RGBA background image and paste the original image onto it, but the correct approach is to use the `Image.alpha_composite` method. 
Secondly, the function does not handle the case of images with a mode other than RGB or RGBA correctly. It should convert such images to RGB mode.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly, and the conversion of images with modes other than RGB or RGBA is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function should check the mode of the input image and take appropriate actions based on its format and mode. For PNG images with RGBA mode, it should use `Image.alpha_composite` to create a new RGBA image with a white background and composite the original image onto it. For images with modes other than RGB or RGBA, it should simply convert them to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes the proper handling of PNG images with RGBA mode using `Image.alpha_composite` and corrects the conversion of images with modes other than RGB.
