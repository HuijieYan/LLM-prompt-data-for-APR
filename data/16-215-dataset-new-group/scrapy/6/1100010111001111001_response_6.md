## Correction:

The issue is that the wrong image object is being returned in certain cases. The function is not handling transparency correctly for PNG images, and it is not correctly handling the conversion from a palette (P) mode to RGB mode.

The bug-fix strategy involves in correcting the image conversion for PNG images with transparency, as well as ensuring the correct conversion when the image has a palette mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles the special case of PNG images with transparency, ensuring that the transparency is maintained when converting to RGB. It also correctly handles the conversion from palette (P) mode to RGB mode.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
