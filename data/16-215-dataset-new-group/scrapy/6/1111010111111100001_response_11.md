The issue with the provided `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle transparency correctly for PNG images. It should ensure that any transparency is properly handled and converted to a solid background color.

The issue arises from the conditional statements in the `convert_image` function which incorrectly handle different image formats and modes. It fails to consider that PNG images with transparency should be converted to RGB with a solid background to avoid color discrepancies.

To fix the bug, the function needs to explicitly check for the presence of transparency and handle it appropriately, ensuring that the alpha channel is properly handled and converted to a solid background. Additionally, the image mode should be checked and converted if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA']:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])
        image = background
    elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'L']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles RGBA and LA image modes properly, ensuring that any transparency is converted to a solid white background. Additionally, it provides a more robust check for the image mode, ensuring that it's either RGB or L before performing any transformations.

With this corrected implementation, the provided failing test should now pass without errors.
