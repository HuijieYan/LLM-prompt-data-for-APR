The bug in the provided function is that the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode is incorrect, leading to failing test cases for transparency issues. To fix this, we need to handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode correctly.

In the first section of the buggy function, the bug causes PNG images with RGBA mode to be converted incorrectly to RGB mode, leading to mismatched color values and failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition for handling PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode conversion by preserving the alpha channel and fill the image with a white background.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Fill with white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Preserve the alpha channel during RGBA to RGB conversion
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode correctly, allowing the failing test cases to pass.
