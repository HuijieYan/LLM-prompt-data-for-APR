The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the handling of images with RGBA mode and PNG format. The function should convert the RGBA image to RGB and, if needed, resize the image. However, the current implementation incorrectly processes the RGBA image and does not handle the resizing behavior correctly.

The failing test case is related to the transparency case, where an RGBA image with PNG format is provided. The expected outcome is that the image should be converted to RGB, and the resulting colors should be (205, 230, 255).

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the RGBA images when converting them to RGB and also ensure that resizing is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the transparency case correctly and also ensure that resizing is done accurately.
