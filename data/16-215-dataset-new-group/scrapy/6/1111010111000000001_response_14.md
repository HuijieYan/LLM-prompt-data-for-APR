The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle the transparency case correctly when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It tries to directly convert the transparency mode to 'RGB', leading to loss of information. Additionally, in the first conditional block, when creating a new background image, the `paste` function also needs to specify the mask argument to handle the transparency properly.

By analyzing the failing test, we can see that the test cases related to transparency and RGBA mode are not passing as expected, indicating that the bug lies within the handling of these cases.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `convert_image` function needs to be updated to properly handle the transparency case when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. This can be achieved by creating a new background image with a white background color and then pasting the input image onto the new background with the mask. Then, convert this new image to 'RGB' mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the above fix, the transparency case when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' will be handled correctly, ensuring that the failing test cases related to transparency and RGBA mode will pass as expected.
