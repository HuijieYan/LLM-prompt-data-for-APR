Based on the given buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the bug could be caused by incorrect image format and mode handling inside the `convert_image` function. The failing test indicates that the converted image does not match the expected result for some specific cases.

In the `convert_image` function, the logic for handling images with different modes and formats seems to be problematic. The issue is likely related to the handling of images with transparency or specific color modes, as indicated by the failing test cases that involve PNG and RGBA color mode.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Check the image format and mode at the beginning of the function.
2. If the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, convert it to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. Then convert the new image to RGB.
3. If the image is in a mode other than RGB, simply convert it to RGB.
4. After these conversions, perform the thumbnail operation and save the image in JPEG format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the start for reading
        return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now handle different image modes and formats correctly, addressing the bug that caused the failing test. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
