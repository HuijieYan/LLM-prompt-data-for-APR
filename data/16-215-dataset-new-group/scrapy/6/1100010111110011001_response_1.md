The buggy function is failing to properly convert the input image to the desired format, resulting in a failing test and the given error message. The function appears to have issues with logic in the conditionals, as well as the thumbnail resizing function.

The first issue is related to the logic for converting images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. The function is not properly handling transparency (alpha) channel, which is leading to incorrect color values in the output.

The second issue is with the thumbnail resizing of the image, where the function is not keeping the correct image ratio, resulting in incorrect image size in the output.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
- When the input image is in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, it should be properly converted to 'RGB' mode after handling transparency.
- The thumbnail resizing should maintain the aspect ratio of the original image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert image to RGBA mode and fill the image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and calculate thumbnail size while maintaining aspect ratio
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image to buffer in JPEG format
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should correctly handle the different image format and mode combinations, and produce the expected output for the failing test.
