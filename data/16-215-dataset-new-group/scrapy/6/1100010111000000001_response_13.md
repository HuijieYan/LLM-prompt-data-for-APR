The bug in the given function is that the condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' doesn't handle the transparency correctly. When the image has transparency, the white background should be blended with the image. However, the code just pastes the original image on top of a white background, which will result in an incorrect image when converted to RGB.

To fix the bug, the code should handle the transparency by blending the image with the new background before converting it to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the white background
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the composited image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the corrected function should handle the transparency correctly for PNG images with RGBA mode, and also handle the conversion to RGB for other modes. The corrected function should pass the failing test.
