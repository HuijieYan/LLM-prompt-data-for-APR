The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing tests due to incorrect conversions of image formats. Based on the failing test, it looks like the function fails to preserve the image colors and dimensions during the conversions, resulting in assertion errors.

The potential error locations are:
1. The conditional block that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode, where the background color is pasted onto the image and then converted to RGB. This seems to be causing color mismatches and size distortions.
2. The conditional block that checks for non-RGB mode and immediately converts the image to RGB without preserving the original format or mode.

It seems that the bug is causing the function to lose information during format and mode conversions, leading to incorrect output image attributes. To fix the bug, we can implement a strategy that ensures preserving the original image format and mode during conversion, and correctly resizing images when a `size` argument is provided.

Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Preserve the original format and mode
    img_format = image.format
    img_mode = image.mode
    
    if img_format == 'PNG' and img_mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency before conversion
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif img_mode != 'RGB':
        # Preserve the original format and mode when converting to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Preserve the original format and mode when resizing
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image with the original format
    image.save(buf, img_format)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we preserve the original format and mode of the input image using the `img_format` and `img_mode` variables. We then use these variables to save the image with the original format at the end of the function.

By maintaining the original format and mode throughout the conversion process, and correctly handling transparency and resizing, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
