The bug in the given function is that it incorrectly converts transparent PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB mode without preserving the transparency.

The bug is located in the `convert_image` function, where it incorrectly handles images with the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. When trying to convert a transparent PNG image to an RGB mode, it does not preserve the transparency, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function simply replaces the transparent PNG image with a white background and converts it to RGB without considering the transparency channel.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to preserve the transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB mode. This can be achieved using the `alpha_composite` method in PIL library to composite the image over a white background while preserving the transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the `alpha_composite` method to composite the image over a white background, we ensure that the transparency is preserved when converting from RGBA to RGB mode.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
