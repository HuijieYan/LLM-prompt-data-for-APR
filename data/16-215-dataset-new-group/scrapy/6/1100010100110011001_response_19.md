The buggy function has several issues. The main issue is that when converting from RGBA to RGB, it is not properly handling the transparency values, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA' properly. We need to fix these issues.

The first error is causing the transparency values to be ignored when converting from RGBA to RGB, leading to incorrect colors in the output. The second error is not properly handling the case where the image format is PNG and the mode is not RGBA.

To fix the first error, we can use the `Image.alpha_composite` method to handle transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB. For the second error, we can add a condition to convert the image to RGBA if the format is PNG and the mode is not RGBA.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = Image.alpha_composite(Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255)), image).convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should handle transparency properly when converting from RGBA to RGB, and it should also handle cases where the image format is PNG and the mode is not RGBA correctly. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
