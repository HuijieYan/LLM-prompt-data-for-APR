The issue in the `convert_image` function seems to be that the color channels are not being handled correctly, which causes the `getcolors` method to return incorrect values. This is likely due to the conditional statements not accurately converting the image to the desired format.

The function should be updated to handle transparency and palette cases properly, so that the resulting image's colors match the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional statements for handling transparency and palette cases are implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with transparency and palette cases, ensuring that the resulting image's colors match the expected values and pass the failing test.
