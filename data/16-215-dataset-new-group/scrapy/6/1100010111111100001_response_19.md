The problem is in the if-elif block. When the input image is PNG and has an RGBA mode, the code creates a new RGBA image with a white background and then converts it to RGB. However, this does not preserve the transparency of the original image, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if-elif block to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. We will create a new RGBA image with the appropriate background, and then convert it to RGB while preserving the transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and preserve transparency, thus passing the failing test.
