The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test. The problem arises when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', as the function is not applying the correct conversion.

The bug is in this section of the code:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
elif image.mode != 'RGB':
    image = image.convert('RGB')
```

The bug is caused because the condition to convert the image to 'RGB' is triggered when the image mode is not 'RGB', but it should only be triggered when the image format is not 'PNG' and mode is not 'RGBA'.

To fix the bug, we need to change the conditional statements to check for the correct conditions for converting the image to 'RGB'. Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format != 'PNG' or image.mode != 'RGBA':
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the conversion of images in the specified conditions and pass the failing test.
