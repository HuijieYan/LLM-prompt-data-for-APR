The function `convert_image` has several issues that need to be fixed in order to pass the failing test. The main problems are related to image format and mode conversions. The failing test cases provide important insights into the expected input and output values.

When looking at the failing test cases, it's clear that the function should handle images with different formats and modes properly, and it should also handle image thumbnail generation correctly.

Based on the failing test cases and known issues with the function, the following steps can be taken to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that transparency in PNG images is handled properly, and that the conversion to JPEG is done correctly.
2. Check the condition for converting images from RGBA to RGB and handle it appropriately.
3. Ensure that thumbnail generation maintains the image ratio and produces the correct size.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':  # Handle transparency in PNG images
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':  # Convert non-RGB images to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:  # Generate thumbnail with the correct size
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the beginning before returning
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with image format and mode conversions, and also ensures proper thumbnail generation. It should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
