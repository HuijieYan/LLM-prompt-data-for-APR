The `convert_image` function converts an input image to a different format and size. It appears that the function has a bug as the failing test indicates that the returned image mode and colors are not as expected.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conversion of the input image format and mode.
2. The handling of image size using the `thumbnail` method.
3. The operation of saving the image buffer.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the PNG RGBA case correctly. When converting from PNG RGBA to RGB, the transparency is not being handled properly, leading to differences in the returned image colors.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the RGBA transparency when converting from PNG RGBA to RGB by setting a background color.
2. Ensure that the thumbnail method maintains the image ratio correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Handle transparency for PNG RGBA
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected version of the function takes into account the handling of PNG RGBA images by setting a white background and then converting to RGB. Additionally, the function maintains the image ratio when using the thumbnail method.

After applying these changes, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
