The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling images with transparency, causing the mode and colors to be incorrectly converted. Additionally, the function is not resizing the image correctly when a size parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Address the incorrect handling of transparency for PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. Ensure that the image is resized correctly when a size parameter is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```
After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle the transparency of PNG images with RGBA mode and resize images as expected.

This corrected version should pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
