The potential error locations in the buggy function are as follows:
1. The condition for checking the image format and mode may not cover all scenarios, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.
2. The size may not be correctly handled when creating the thumbnail.

The cause of the bug is the inadequate conditions for checking the image format and mode, as well as potential issues with handling the size for thumbnail generation.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that the image format and mode are properly handled to cover all possible scenarios.
2. Correctly handle the image size for thumbnail generation to avoid unexpected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ("RGBA", "P"):
        image = image.convert("RGB")
        
    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we handle the image mode more inclusively by checking for "RGBA" and "P" modes and converting them to "RGB". We also directly use `image.thumbnail` to handle the size for thumbnail generation.
