The buggy function has multiple issues that need to be addressed:
1. The conditional statement for checking if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA is incorrect, as it should be checking if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
2. In the first conditional block, when creating the background image, the paste function is being called incorrectly. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
3. In the second conditional block, the conversion from any other mode to RGB is invalid. It should use another approach to handle this case.

Given the input/output values and the expected input/output values, we can conclude that the cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of different image formats and modes, leading to incorrect mode conversion and size change.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional blocks to handle the different scenarios properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
In the corrected version, the conditional statements have been updated to properly handle different image formats and modes, resolving the issues identified. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
