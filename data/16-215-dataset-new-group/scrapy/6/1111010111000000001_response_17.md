The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The code does not handle the case where the image format is neither 'PNG' nor 'JPEG'.
2. The conversion logic for RGBA and PNG images is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the convert_image function is not handling all possible image formats and color modes correctly, as evidenced by the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should update the convert_image function to handle all image formats and color modes correctly and ensure that the thumbnail keeps the image ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the code to correctly handle all image formats and color modes while maintaining the image ratio when generating thumbnails. This should fix the bug and make the convert_image function pass the failing test.
