The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for the image format and mode may not be sufficient to handle all types of images.
2. Converting the image to RGB format may not handle all cases, especially if the image has an alpha channel.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks for the image format and mode may not cover all possible cases, leading to incorrect conversion and saving of the image.

To fix the bug, you can use the `image.convert()` method with the `L` mode to remove the alpha channel from RGBA images and then convert to RGB format. Additionally, handle the case where the image mode is not 'RGB' or 'RGBA' by converting to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
