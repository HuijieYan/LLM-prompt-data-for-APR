The buggy function has several issues:
1. The condition for checking the format and mode of the image is incorrect, leading to possible issues with converting the image.
2. There is a bug in the image conversion process, especially when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA.
3. There is no need to convert the image to RGB if its mode is already RGB.

The cause of the bug is that the current code does not properly handle the conversion and image format checks. The incorrect conditions and unnecessary conversion are leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the condition for checking the image format and mode to accurately identify PNG format and RGBA mode, and handle the conversion accordingly.
2. Remove the unnecessary conversion to RGB if the image is already in RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
