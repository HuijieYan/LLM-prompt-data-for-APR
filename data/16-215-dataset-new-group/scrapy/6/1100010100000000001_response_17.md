Potential error locations:
1. The `background.paste(image, image)` statement looks suspicious as it's trying to paste the image onto itself.
2. The `image = image.convert('RGB')` statement is missing a condition to check whether the image is in 'P' mode.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method and the missing condition to check the mode of the image before converting it to 'RGB' which may result in an error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `background.paste(image, image)` statement to use the correct syntax for pasting the image onto the background.
2. Add a condition to check the mode of the image before converting it to 'RGB' to avoid potential errors.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background

    if image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
