The bug lies in the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` which converts the image from RGBA to RGB. This condition does not handle transparency properly and results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to handle transparency correctly by checking for transparency in the image. We can use the `split` method of the image to extract the alpha channel and then apply the background for transparency.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if 'A' in image.getbands():  # Check if the image has an alpha channel
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This version checks if the image has an alpha channel and applies the alpha channel as a mask when pasting over the background. This approach ensures that transparency is handled correctly and the function will now pass the failing tests.
