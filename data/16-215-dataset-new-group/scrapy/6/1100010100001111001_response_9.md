The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the RGBA mode image with PNG format correctly. When the input image has PNG format and RGBA mode, it should be converted to RGB mode, and if it has a different mode, it should be converted to RGB mode.

Also, the function is saving the image in JPEG format, which can cause loss of transparency for PNG images with an alpha channel.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode should be updated to properly handle the conversion to RGB. Additionally, the image should be saved in PNG format to preserve transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf
```
