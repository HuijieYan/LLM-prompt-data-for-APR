The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for image format and mode, and the resizing of the image.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of the image format and mode, and the resizing of the image may not be performed properly in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can add proper error handling to ensure that the image is correctly converted to the desired format and mode, and that the resizing is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
