The `convert_image` function is used to transform the input image and save it in the JPEG format, and then return the transformed image and the buffer object. The expected behavior is to check the format and mode of the input image and perform the appropriate conversion logic based on the format and mode.

The potential error locations in the `convert_image` function are within the conditional blocks that handle different image formats and modes. There might be issues with the conversion of RGBA to RGB, and the creation of thumbnails, specifically when dealing with transparency.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the conversion logic for images with RGBA mode and transparency, and the calculation of the thumbnail size might not preserve the image's aspect ratio. This leads to failing assertions in the test, as seen in the error message.

To fix the bug, the conversion logic for RGBA images should correctly handle transparency, and thumbnail creation should correctly preserve the image aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, resample=Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
