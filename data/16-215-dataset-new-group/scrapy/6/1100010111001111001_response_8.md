The issue with the convert_image function is that it incorrectly handles PNG images with transparency and palette modes. It also doesn't properly handle thumbnail resizing. 

To address these issues, we need to make the following changes:
1. Check for transparency and palette modes in PNG images and convert them to RGB.
2. Correctly handle resizing the image when creating a thumbnail.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
            image = image.convert('RGBA' if image.mode == 'P' else 'RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

These changes will fix the issues with handling PNG images with transparency and palette modes, as well as properly resizing the image when creating a thumbnail. With these changes, the function should pass all the failing test cases.
