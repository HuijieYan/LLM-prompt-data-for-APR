The issue with the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The failing test shows that the function is not converting the RGBA images to RGB mode correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual colors.

The potential error locations within the `convert_image` function are:
1. The condition to check for PNG and RGBA mode might not be handled correctly.
2. The conversion from RGBA to RGB might not be performed accurately.
3. There could be issues with resizing and the final output format.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode in the `convert_image` function. The failing test is specifically checking for the colors for the converted image and finding a mismatch between the expected and actual colors. This indicates that the conversion from RGBA to RGB mode is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode, it is correctly converted to RGB mode. Additionally, the resizing and saving of the image should also be performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the paste operation and ensuring that the RGBA to RGB conversion is done correctly, this corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
