The buggy function `convert_image` has two potential error locations. 
1. The first potential error is in the if condition where it checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, it creates a new background to paste the image onto and then converts it to RGB. This block should also check if the image mode is RGBA.
2. The second potential error is in the `image.save` method at the end of the function. This method saves the image as a JPEG but does not reset the buffer position, causing the JPEG to be incomplete.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling RGBA images correctly when converting to RGB, and it is not resetting the buffer position after saving the image.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the first if condition to check for image mode instead of just the image format and mode, and to reset the buffer position after saving the image.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
