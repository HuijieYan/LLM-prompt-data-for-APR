The causes of the bug in the `convert_image` function are related to incorrect handling of the image format and mode. 

In the first conditional block, the function is intended to handle images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' by creating a new background, pasting the original image onto it, then converting the image to 'RGB'. However, the code `background.paste(image, image)` is incorrect and should be replaced with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This is why the test case involving PNG and RGBA images is failing.

In the second conditional block, the function is intended to handle images with a mode other than 'RGB' by converting them to 'RGB'. However, the code uses `convert` method which is incorrect. The `convert` method does not change the mode, for this purpose, the `'.convert('RGB')' line should be replaced with `.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)`. This is why the test case involving images with a different mode is failing.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditional blocks to handle the images with the correct methods, and where necessary, use the right parameters.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
