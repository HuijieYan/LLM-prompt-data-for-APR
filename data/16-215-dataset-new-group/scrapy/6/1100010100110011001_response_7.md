The `convert_image` function is expected to convert the input image to the RGB mode and resize it to the given size if specified. The function saves the converted image as a JPEG file and returns the converted image and its in-memory byte buffer.

### Identified bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle transparency in PNG images correctly. When the input image is in PNG format and has the RGBA mode, it fills the transparent areas with white color instead of preserving the original transparency.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the RGBA mode specifically for PNG images. Instead of creating a new background with white color, the transparent areas should be retained in the background while pasting the original image. Then, the mode of the image should be checked and converted to RGB if it is not in the RGB mode.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function now handles PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, preserving transparency by creating a transparent background. It also checks the mode of the image and converts it to RGB if needed.
The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
