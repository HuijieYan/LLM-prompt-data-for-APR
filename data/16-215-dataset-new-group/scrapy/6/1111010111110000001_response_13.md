The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class processes images for thumbnail generation, conversion to RGB, and saving as JPEG. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks that this image processing is working correctly for different image formats and modes.

The failing test consists of assertions that check if the `convert_image` function properly converts images to RGB mode, creates thumbnails while maintaining the image ratio, and handles transparency in images with different modes and formats.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the output of the `convert_image` function differs from the expected output, specifically when converting a PNG image with RGBA mode to RGB.

The potential error location in the `convert_image` function could be in the conditional statement that checks if the input image has the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA'. The code block that creates a new image with a white background and then converts it to RGB might not be handling this process correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for handling PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect, and this leads to an unexpected result in the conversion process. The failing test and the corresponding error message indicate that this conditional block is not working as expected.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve debugging the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode and ensuring that the image processing steps for this specific condition are carried out correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    image = Image.open(buf)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, modifications have been made to the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode. The creation of a new RGB image with a white background and the correct conversion process should ensure that the bug is fixed.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test by producing the expected image outputs and modes across different image formats and modes.
