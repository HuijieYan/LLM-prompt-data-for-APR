The bug is caused by the wrong conversion of images with RGBA mode to RGB mode and the wrong resizing of images. The image conversion from RGBA to RGB mode is incorrect, and it leads to the failing test in the transparency case with RGBA and PNG.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditions for image mode and format checks, use the correct conversion method for RGBA images, and ensure that the image size is maintained when creating the thumbnail.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        original_size = image.size
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        if original_size[0] < size[0] or original_size[1] < size[1]:
            # If the image is smaller than the given size, create a new image with the background color as white
            background = Image.new('RGB', size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, ((size[0] - original_size[0]) // 2, (size[1] - original_size[1]) // 2))
            image = background

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values in the test.
