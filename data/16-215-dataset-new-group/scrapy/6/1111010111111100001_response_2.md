The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle transparency correctly when converting images. This causes the function to fail when handling transparent images.

The problem arises from the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, which only checks for the image format and mode, but doesn't handle the scenario where the image may have transparency in different modes (e.g., when the image is converted to 'P' with a transparency palette).

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement and handle transparency appropriately for various image modes.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA'] or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the image mode is 'RGBA' or 'LA', or if it is a palette-based image with transparency. If any of these conditions are met, we convert the image to 'RGB' to handle transparency correctly. We then proceed with thumbnail creation and image saving as before.

With this fix, the `convert_image` function should be able to handle transparent images correctly and pass the failing test.
