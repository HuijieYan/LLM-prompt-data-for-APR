The bug in the code is causing the images to be converted incorrectly, resulting in failing tests.

The issue with the buggy function `convert_image` lies in the conditional statement that checks for the image format and mode. The image format and mode are not being handled correctly, causing the conversion to be inaccurate and failing the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to add separate conditions for handling PNG and RGBA images. Specifically, for PNG and RGBA images, an additional step is required to handle the transparency and convert the background before converting the image to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the image using its alpha channel as mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the updated function handles the RGBA and PNG cases properly, ensuring that the images are converted and saved correctly. This should fix the failing tests.
