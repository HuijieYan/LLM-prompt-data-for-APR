The issue with the provided function seems to be in the logic for converting images, especially when handling different image formats and modes. 

It appears that the conversion logic is not correctly handling the transparency of PNG images and converting them to RGB. This results in incorrect color values and the failure of the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to specifically handle the conversion of PNG images with an alpha channel and handle transparent pixels appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Handle transparency for PNG images with alpha channel
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        # Convert all other images to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function now handles PNG images with alpha channels correctly and converts them to RGB without losing transparency. It also properly converts other images to RGB format. This should address the issues and ensure that the tests pass.
