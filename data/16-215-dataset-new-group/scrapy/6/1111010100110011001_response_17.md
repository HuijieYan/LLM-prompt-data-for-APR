The bug in the convert_image function appears to be related to the conversion of images to a specific format.

To begin, the test_convert_image method from the test_pipeline_images module is failing when it expects certain values from the converted images, but the buggy function is not returning the expected values. This suggests that the bug is likely in the logic of the convert_image function.

Upon analyzing the convert_image function, it seems that the bug may be due to the `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line. This line is explicitly saving the image in JPEG format, which may be overriding the format being tested in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line should be updated to dynamically save the image in its original format, rather than hardcoding it to 'JPEG'. This will ensure that the images retain their original formats and prevent unintended changes.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    original_format = image.format  # Store the original format
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, original_format)  # Save in the original format
    return image, buf
```

By using the original_format variable to dynamically save the image in its original format, the bug should be fixed. Running the failing test cases should now result in the expected output, thereby satisfying the requirements.
