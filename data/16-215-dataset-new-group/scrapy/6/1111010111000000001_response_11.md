The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to a specific format and thumbnail size. However, the bug occurs due to incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function fails to properly handle the conversion to RGB mode along with the handling of the transparency issue, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we should include a specific handling for PNG images with RGBA mode to properly convert and handle the transparency issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGB image with a white background replacing the transparency
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Apply the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, we use the `paste` method to handle the transparency by creating a new RGB image with a white background and applying the alpha channel as a mask.

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test.
