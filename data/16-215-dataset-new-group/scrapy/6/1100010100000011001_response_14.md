The buggy function is supposed to convert an input image file to a specified size and format. The buggy function has several potential errors in the conditional statements and the image manipulation process. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The first conditional statement seems to incorrectly handle PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. The second conditional statement does not handle the conversion of non-RGB mode images correctly.
3. The thumbnail function may not be working as expected.
4. The save method might not be converting the image to the JPEG format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode and non-RGB mode images. Additionally, the image format may not be correctly handled when converting to JPEG.

### Fixing Strategy:
We can address these potential errors by improving the conditional statements and verifying the conversion process to ensure that PNG images with RGBA mode and non-RGB mode images are handled correctly. Additionally, we need to verify that the image is saved in the correct JPEG format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=90)
    return image, buf
```
