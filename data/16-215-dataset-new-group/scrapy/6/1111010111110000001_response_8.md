The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:
1. It mishandles PNG images with RGBA mode and does not properly convert them to RGB.
2. The function saves all images as JPEG, no matter the original format, which may cause issues with transparency.
3. The image thumbnail logic is not being applied correctly, as evidenced by the failing test case.

The failing test is comparing converted images to expected values and is failing for RGBA mode images in the `convert_image` function.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly and convert them to RGB.
2. Modify the code to save images in their original format instead of always saving as JPEG.
3. Ensure that the thumbnail logic is properly applied.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version properly handles images with RGBA mode, saves images in their original format, and properly applies the thumbnail logic. After making these changes, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test.
