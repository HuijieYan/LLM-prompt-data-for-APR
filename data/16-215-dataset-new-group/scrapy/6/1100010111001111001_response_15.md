The issue with the current implementation is that when the input image is in RGBA mode, the code creates a new RGBA background and pastes the image onto it. Then it converts the resulting image to RGB mode, which causes the transparency data to be lost. Additionally, there are issues when handling an image in mode 'P' which is indexed mode.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for converting images, ensuring that we handle RGBA mode images properly without losing transparency data, and also handle indexed mode images appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the input image is in indexed mode ('P') and convert it to RGB mode. Then, for other modes, we handle the thumbnail resizing if a size is provided. Finally, we save the image to a buffer and return the image along with the buffer.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
