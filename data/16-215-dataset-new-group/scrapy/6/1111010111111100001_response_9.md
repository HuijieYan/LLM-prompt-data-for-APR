The buggy function `convert_image` is currently not handling all image formats correctly. It is failing to convert images to the required format before saving them, which is causing the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not appropriately handling transparency and palette modes when converting images. The failing test case expects certain formats and modes after conversion, which the buggy function is not providing.

To fix the bug, the function needs to explicitly handle the different image modes and formats and convert them to the desired mode and format before saving the image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'L':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now handles RGBA mode correctly by creating a new RGBA image with a white background, then pasting the original image on top of it before converting it to RGB.
- It checks for palette mode (L) and handles it appropriately.
- It explicitly converts images to RGB mode before saving them, which addresses the failing test cases related to image mode.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
