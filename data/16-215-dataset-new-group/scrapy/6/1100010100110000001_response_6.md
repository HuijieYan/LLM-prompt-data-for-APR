The issue with the 'convert_image' function is that it is not handling the RGBA format correctly. When the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function is converting it to RGB format without handling transparency properly, leading to a change in colors. This is causing the test case to fail.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. If so, handle transparency and convert it to RGB format properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Convert the image to bytes
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the 'convert_image' function should handle transparency in PNG images with RGBA mode properly and pass the failing test case.
