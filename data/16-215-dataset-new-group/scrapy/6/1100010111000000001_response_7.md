There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The first potential issue is the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`. The issue may be occurring due to the comparison operator `==` being used with the image format and mode.
2. Another issue is with the `background.paste(image, image)` statement. It seems that `background.paste` is being used incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the PNG format with an RGBA mode properly, resulting in the failing test for transparency cases.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the PNG format with an RGBA mode and correctly paste the image onto the background when converting to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
