The buggy function has a couple of issues. 

First, the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is incorrect because it's checking the image format when it should only be checking the mode for 'RGBA'. The correct condition should be `image.mode == 'RGBA'`.

Secondly, when checking if the image mode is not 'RGB', the current code is converting the image to 'RGB'. However, the correct approach would be to convert it to 'RGBA' if it's not in that mode.

Another issue is that the background is not being pasted correctly. The correct way to do it is to use `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.

Finally, the image should be returned as the first argument and the BytesIO object as the second argument.

To fix the above-mentioned issues, we need to update the `convert_image` function as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
