The bug in the `convert_image` method of the `ImagesPipeline` class seems to be related to incorrect handling of image formats and modes. The bug is leading to failing tests as the format and mode of images are not being handled correctly, causing the color and transparency channels to be incorrect in the output images.

The bug can be seen in the failing tests where the expected color values don't match the actual color values in the output image. This indicates that the image format and mode are not being handled properly in the `convert_image` method.

The potential error locations within the `convert_image` function include the conditional statements for handling different image formats and modes. These conditional statements are not handling all cases properly, leading to incorrect conversions.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of image formats and modes in the `convert_image` function. For example, when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function is not correctly converting the image to the desired format and mode. Similarly, when the mode is not 'RGB', the function is not handling conversion properly.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the image format and mode are correctly handled in all cases. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements to correctly handle different image formats and modes and perform the appropriate conversions.

The corrected version of the `convert_image` method is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as mask
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the BytesIO buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the method, the handling of PNG and RGBA format and mode is fixed by creating a new RGB background and pasting the original image using the alpha channel as a mask to preserve transparency. Additionally, the method ensures that the BytesIO buffer is reset to the beginning before returning it along with the converted image.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
