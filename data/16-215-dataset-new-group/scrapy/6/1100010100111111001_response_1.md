The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test. The bug is likely located within the conditional statements for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. In these cases, the function is creating a new background image using a white color and then converting it to an RGB mode. However, there is no check for transparency in these conditional statements, which is causing the incorrect results when comparing color values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to properly handle transparency in RGBA images and preserve the alpha channel if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA') or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the image with the alpha channel as the mask
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles transparency in RGBA images and preserves the alpha channel when converting PNG images with a transparency palette (mode 'P').

It should now pass the failing test and produce the expected results.
