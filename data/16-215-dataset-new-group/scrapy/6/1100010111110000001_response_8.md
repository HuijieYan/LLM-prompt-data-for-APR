The cause of the bug is that the function `convert_image` incorrectly handles images with transparency (RGBA and PNG). When the function encounters an image with transparency, it does not properly handle the transparency and ends up producing incorrect results.

The `test_convert_image` test function creates various images with different formats and modes and then calls the `convert_image` function to check if the output image matches the expected mode and colors. The failing test specifically checks the mode and colors of the converted image and reports a failure with the error message that the lists of colors differ.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle images with transparency by retaining the alpha channel if present, and then perform the necessary image processing to convert it to the desired format and mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA'] or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        alpha = image.split()[-1]
        background = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=alpha)
        image = background
    elif image.mode not in ['L', 'RGB', 'CMYK']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the image mode is RGBA, LA (Luminance with Alpha), or has a transparency palette. If so, we extract the alpha channel, create a new RGB image with a white background, and then paste the original image onto the new background using the alpha channel as a mask to preserve transparency. This correctly handles the transparency in the image.

After making these changes, the `convert_image` function should properly handle images with transparency and produce the expected results, passing the failing test.
