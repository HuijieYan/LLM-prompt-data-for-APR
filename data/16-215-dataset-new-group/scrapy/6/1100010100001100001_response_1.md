The bug in the provided function occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', resulting in an incorrect conversion process. In this case, a new background image is created using the 'RGBA' mode and pasted with the original image. The updated background is then converted to 'RGB', which does not ensure the correct output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode in a way that correctly converts the image without losing transparency. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the image mode is not 'RGB' but require conversion to 'RGB'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBa')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the image is directly converted to 'RGBa', preserving the alpha channel. If the image mode is not 'RGB', it is converted to 'RGB' as previously done. This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct conversion of images with different formats and modes.
