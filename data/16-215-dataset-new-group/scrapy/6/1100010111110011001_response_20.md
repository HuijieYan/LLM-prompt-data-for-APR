The bug is caused by the incorrect conversion of images with transparency from RGBA to RGB. When the input image is in PNG format and has transparency (mode='RGBA'), the function creates a new image named `background` with a white background and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. However, this approach fails to handle transparency properly and results in a loss of information, causing the failing test case that checks for the expected color values to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle images with transparency correctly and preserve the alpha channel data if it exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'P':
        # If the image mode is 'P' (palette), convert it to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        # If the image is in PNG format and has transparency, convert it to RGBA mode
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    else:
        # Otherwise, convert the image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the image is in 'P' mode, and if so, converts it directly to RGB. Then, it checks if the image is in PNG format and has transparency using the `image.info` dictionary. If so, it converts the image to RGBA mode to preserve the alpha channel data. Otherwise, it converts the image to RGB. This approach ensures that the function handles different image modes and formats correctly, including images with transparency.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
