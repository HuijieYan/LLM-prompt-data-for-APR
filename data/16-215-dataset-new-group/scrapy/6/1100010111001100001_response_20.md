The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. 

The function currently converts RGBA images to RGB by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image on it, and then converting it to RGB. This does not handle transparency correctly and often results in an incorrect image.

To fix this bug, we need to change the way RGBA images are handled. Instead of creating a new background and pasting the image, we should use the `image.convert` method to convert the image directly to RGB. 

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and pass all the failing tests.
