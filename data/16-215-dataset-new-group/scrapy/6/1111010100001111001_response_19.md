The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely due to the incorrect image format conversion and handling of different image modes. The function is failing to handle PNG images with mode 'RGBA', it's not correctly converting them to RGB.

Based on the runtime and expected input/output values, it seems that the function should convert images to RGB if their mode is not 'RGB' or if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. It should also handle resizing images.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to add a condition to handle PNG images with mode 'RGBA' separately and convert them to RGB. Additionally, the function should properly copy and resize the images if a size parameter is given.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version introduces separate handling for PNG images with mode 'RGBA' and converts them to RGB. It also correctly resizes images if a size parameter is given.
