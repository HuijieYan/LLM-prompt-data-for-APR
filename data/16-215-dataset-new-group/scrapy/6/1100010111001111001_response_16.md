Based on the analysis, the identified issues in the buggy function are as follows:

1. Incorrect conditional check for image format and mode.
2. Improper handling of image transparency.
3. Incorrect image conversion for thumbnails.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for image format and mode need to be corrected, and the handling of transparency and thumbnail conversion needs to be improved.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes proper checks for image mode and transparency handling, as well as correct image conversion for thumbnails.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
