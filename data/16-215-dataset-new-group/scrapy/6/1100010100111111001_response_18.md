The problem with the buggy function is that it does not handle transparent images properly, resulting in an incorrect conversion. This is reflected in the failing tests and the comparison of colors not matching the expected values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the code that handles the conversion for transparent images. Specifically, for RGBA images, we need to create a new image with a white background and then paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. This should ensure that the transparency is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This updated function correctly handles transparent images by creating a new RGBA image with a white background and then pasting the original image onto it. It then converts the resulting image to RGB as before. This should ensure that the transparency is handled correctly, and the failing tests should now pass.
