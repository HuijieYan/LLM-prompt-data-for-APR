The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't check for the input image format before making conversions. The function assumes that the input image is always in the 'PNG' format, and it tries to check if the mode is 'RGBA' for PNG images. Additionally, it doesn't account for the case when the input image is already in the 'RGB' format. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for the image format before performing any conversions. We also need to handle the case when the input image is already in the 'RGB' format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle images of different formats and modes, ensuring that the image conversions are done correctly.
