The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of the image mode and format. It tries to convert images to RGB and then saves them as JPEG, but there are some discrepancies in how it handles different image modes and formats.

The failing test is mainly related to the `getcolors` method, which is used to check the colors in the image. It seems that the function is not correctly converting the image to the expected mode and is therefore failing the test assertions.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function to properly handle different image modes and formats and ensure that the output matches the expected values and types provided in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

This version of the function should address the issues related to different image modes and formats and ensure that the output matches the expected values and types in the failing test cases.
