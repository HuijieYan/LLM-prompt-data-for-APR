The buggy function has a few potential error locations based on the provided runtime input/output values. The function has conditional statements based on the image format and mode, and then it performs various operations including pasting the image onto a background and converting it to a different mode, and resizing the image if a size parameter is provided.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling all cases properly. For example, in Case 1, the function incorrectly converts the image to JPEG format and ignores the input image format.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements to properly handle the different image formats and modes, and ensure that the operations performed are consistently applied in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the conditional statements and adjusted the `paste()` method to properly handle the pasting of the image onto the background. Additionally, the `save()` method now includes the `format` parameter to specify the output format as 'JPEG'. We also added `buf.seek(0)` to ensure the buffer's pointer is reset to the beginning before returning it.

With these updates, the function should now handle different image formats and modes correctly and consistently.
