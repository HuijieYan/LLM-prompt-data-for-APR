The bug in the given function is that it converts images to RGB format, even when they are already in the correct format. It also creates issues with transparency for PNG images.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle transparency correctly and avoid unnecessary conversion of images to RGB format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass all the provided failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values.
