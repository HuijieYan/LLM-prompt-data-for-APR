Based on the failing test and expected output values, it appears the bug occurs when the function attempts to convert images with PNG format and RGBA mode. The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of transparency in PNG images.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conversion logic to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, ensuring that transparency is preserved when converting to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the inaccurate handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, ensuring that transparency is preserved during the conversion process. The updated logic uses `Image.alpha_composite` to composite the RGBA image over a solid background before converting it to RGB.
