```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

Explanation:
The bug within the original function stems from the conditional statement checking the image format and mode. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the code incorrectly tries to create a new RGBA background and paste the original image onto it, which results in an incorrect mode conversion to 'RGB'.

To fix the bug, the background should be created using the 'RGB' mode and the original image should be pasted onto it. Additionally, the original conversion of the image to 'RGB' is unnecessary and has been removed in the fixed version.

The corrected version of the function properly handles images of different formats and modes by treating them according to the specified conditions and prerequisites.
