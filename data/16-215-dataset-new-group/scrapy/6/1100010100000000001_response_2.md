## The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

## Error Analysis
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `paste` method is called with the wrong syntax. It was missing the position argument.
2. The `image.save` does not reset the file pointer to the beginning of the buffer, which may cause issues when trying to read from the buffer later.

## Bug Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the `paste` method needs to be called with the correct syntax, including the position argument. Additionally, the file pointer of the buffer needs to be reset to the beginning after saving the image to the buffer.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should provide the correct syntax for the `paste` method and reset the file pointer of the buffer after saving the image.

The corrected version of the function shown above includes these fixes.
