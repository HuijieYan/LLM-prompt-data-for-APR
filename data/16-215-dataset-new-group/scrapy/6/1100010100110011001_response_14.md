The bug in the provided function is caused by the logic for handling PNG images with an RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts these images to RGB mode without taking into account the alpha channel. This results in a loss of transparency and incorrect color compositions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle PNG images with an RGBA mode properly. Specifically, we need to account for the alpha channel and preserve transparency in the output image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image onto it
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the composite image to RGB

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode, preserving transparency and ensuring correct color compositions.

With the corrected function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
