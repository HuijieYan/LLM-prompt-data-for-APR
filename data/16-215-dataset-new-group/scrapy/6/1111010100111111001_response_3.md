The bug in the provided function is likely due to incorrect handling of images with transparency. Specifically, the function incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB images by applying a white background and then converting the image, which results in incorrect color values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional logic that handles RGBA images to ensure that the transparency information is correctly preserved.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # ... (other functions)

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            return background, BytesIO(background.tobytes())
        else:
            # For other image modes, simply convert the image to RGB and apply the thumbnail
            image = image.convert('RGB')
            
            if size:
                image = image.copy()
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
            
            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
            return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we handle RGBA images differently by creating a new RGBA image with a white background and pasting the original image on top of it. This preserves the transparency information and ensures that the resulting image is correct.

By using this corrected version, the failing tests should pass, and the function will produce the expected output for the given input cases.
