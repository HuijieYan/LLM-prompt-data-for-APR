### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `convert_image` function does not handle RGBA PNG images correctly. When it encounters an RGBA PNG image, it creates a new RGBA background and pastes the original image onto it but then incorrectly converts it to RGB mode. This results in a loss of the alpha channel and causes the test to fail. Additionally, the function incorrectly converts other image modes to RGB even if they are not RGBA.

### Fix Strategy
The `convert_image` function needs to be modified to correctly handle RGBA PNG images and preserve their alpha channel. It also needs to only convert non-RGB images to RGB, and leave already RGB images as is.

### The Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
