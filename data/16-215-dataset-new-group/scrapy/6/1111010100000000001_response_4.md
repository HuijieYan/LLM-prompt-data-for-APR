### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is trying to convert the input image to a JPEG format and generate a thumbnail. However, the conditions for checking the image format and mode are incorrect, which may lead to incorrect format conversion or skipping the conversion altogether.

### Error location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditions for checking the image format and mode.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking the image format and mode is incorrect, leading to incorrect or skipped conversion of the image format.
Since the function lacks proper checks for different scenarios, the function can behave unpredictably or raise exceptions.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, correct the condition for checking the image format and mode, and include proper error handling to raise exceptions when the image format is not supported or when the size is not specified.

The corrected function checks for the image format, whether it is JPEG or JPG, and also checks if the size is specified. If the conditions are met, it generates a thumbnail and returns the image in JPEG format with an associated buffer. If the conditions are not met, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate message.

By including proper checks and handling different scenarios, the function provides a more robust and predictable behavior.
