The issue with the buggy function lies in the conditional statements and the handling of the input image. The function is expected to handle images of different formats and modes correctly, but it fails to do so in some cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

The first issue is with the transparency case when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function incorrectly converts the image to 'RGB' without preserving the transparency information. This leads to a mismatch in expected and actual colors when the test compares the image colors. The conversion should preserve the alpha channel information when converting from RGBA to RGB.

Another issue is with the case when the image mode is 'P' (palette). In this case, the function incorrectly converts the image directly to 'RGB' without considering the original color palette. This leads to a mismatch in expected and actual colors when the test compares the image colors. The conversion should preserve the original color palette when converting from 'P' to 'RGB'.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly handle images of different formats and modes, preserving transparency and color palette information during conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB
        image = image.convert("RGBA")
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        # Preserve original color palette when converting from P to RGB
        image = image.convert("RGB", palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the transparency case by converting the image to 'RGBA' and preserving the alpha channel before performing the conversion. Similarly, we handle the palette case by preserving the original color palette before converting the image to 'RGB'. These changes ensure that the transparency and color palette information is preserved during conversion, resulting in correct outputs for all input cases.
