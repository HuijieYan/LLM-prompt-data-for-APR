One potential issue is that the function is not handling the case where the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'P', as shown in Case 4. Additionally, the function is not returning the correct values, as seen in the runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return.

To fix the bug, we should add a conditional check for the image format being 'JPEG' and the mode being 'P', and handle it accordingly. Also, we need to fix the return statement to return the correct values.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # move to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```
