The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs because the logic for converting PNG images with an RGBA mode is not handled correctly. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is supposed to create a new RGBA image with a white background and then convert it to RGB. However, the code does not create a new RGBA image with a white background. This leads to incorrect image conversion and incorrect assertions in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for converting PNG images with an RGBA mode. Specifically, we need to create a new RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with an RGBA mode correctly, and the failing test cases should pass.
