The buggy function is throwing an error when the input image has an alpha channel and format is PNG. The error message indicates that the problem is with the color mismatch. It seems that the alpha channel is not handled properly during the conversion of the image.

The bug is primarily caused by the mishandling of alpha channel when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. This causes the color mismatch and eventually leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the alpha channel properly in the PNG format. We should apply the alpha composite or fill the transparent part with white before converting it to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we handle the alpha channel by pasting the image onto a white background before converting it to RGB. This ensures that the image is properly rendered and the alpha channel is handled correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
