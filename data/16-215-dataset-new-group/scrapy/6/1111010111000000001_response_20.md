The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class has a few issues:

1. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it tries to convert the image to RGB, but doesn't handle transparency correctly.
2. When checking the image mode, it doesn't handle the case when the image is in 'P' mode (palette mode).

The test `test_convert_image` is designed to check these specific cases.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a condition to handle transparency correctly when image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
2. Handle the case when the image is in 'P' mode by converting it to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now handle transparency correctly for PNG images in RGBA mode and also handle images in palette mode ('P'). The corrected function should pass the failing test.
