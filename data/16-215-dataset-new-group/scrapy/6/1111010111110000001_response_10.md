The current `convert_image` method of the `ImagesPipeline` class has a few potential issues that are causing the failing test:
1. When checking for image format and mode, it specifically checks for PNG and RGBA and then converts it to RGB format. However, in the test case, the expected result does not match the converted image.
2. The logic for handling the image format and mode does not seem to preserve the alpha channel correctly.
3. The `convert_image` method does not correctly handle the thumbnail size. In the failing test case, the thumbnail size is set to (10, 25), but the returned thumbnail size does not match the expected value.

To fix the issues with the `convert_image` method, the following corrections can be made:
- Correctly handle the PNG format with RGBA mode and ensure that the alpha channel is preserved.
- Make sure that the thumbnail size is correctly generated and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` method:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve alpha channel by removing mode conversion
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Ensure that the thumbnail size is correctly computed
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` method should now correctly handle the image format, mode, and thumbnail size. This should result in the failing test case passing successfully.
