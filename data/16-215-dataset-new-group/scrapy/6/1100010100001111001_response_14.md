The buggy function is expected to take an image as input and convert it to a JPEG, ensuring that the final image is in RGB mode. It also have the option to resize the image.

The potential error lies in the image format and mode checks. The function is incorrectly checking if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', and then attempting to convert it to 'RGB' in a way that is not fully robust. 

The cause of the bug is that the function erroneously converts the image to 'RGB' mode in cases where its format is not 'PNG' or its mode is not 'RGBA'. This can result in a loss of data if the image is already in 'RGB' mode, or if it has a format other than 'PNG'.

To fix the bug, we should perform the format and mode checks using correct conditional statements, and convert the image mode only if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'PNG' or image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we use correct conditional statements to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', and perform the conversion only in that case. We also check if the format is not 'PNG' or the mode is not 'RGBA' to ensure that other image types are handled correctly.
