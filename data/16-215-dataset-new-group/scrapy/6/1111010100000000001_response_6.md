Buggy function analysis:
The function `convert_image` takes an image and an optional size as input and performs some operations on the image, such as checking the format, converting the image to a different mode if needed, resizing the image, and saving it as a JPEG format. The potential error locations within the function are the format checking and the conversion of the image.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is that if the input image has an alpha channel and is in PNG format, the function pastes the image onto a white background and then converts it to RGB format, but it fails to retain the alpha channel, resulting in a loss of transparency. This results in incorrect image conversion and loss of image quality.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to retain the alpha channel when converting the image from RGBA to RGB format. We can achieve this by using the `Image.alpha_composite()` method to compose the original image with the new background, which will preserve the transparency.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 0))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
