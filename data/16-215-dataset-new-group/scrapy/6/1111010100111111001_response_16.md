The bug in the `convert_image` function appears to lie in the conditional logic to convert images with different formats and modes. The bug causes the function to fail in tests where the input image has a mode of 'P' or 'RGBA' and a format of 'PNG'. This results in the function incorrectly converting the image and causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic to correctly handle images of different formats and modes. Specifically, we need to account for images with 'P' and 'RGBA' modes in addition to 'RGB' mode. We should also handle PNG format images with transparency (RGBA mode) correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should handle images with different modes and formats correctly, passing all the failing test cases provided.
