The buggy function is `convert_image`, which is designed to convert an input image to a different format and size. The function is expected to handle different cases based on the input parameters and their properties.

Potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statements for checking the format and mode of the input image.
2. The image conversion and resizing operations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the cases as expected, leading to incorrect image formats and sizes.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements to accurately handle different image formats and modes, and adjust the image conversion and resizing operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function includes the following updates:
1. Using `(0, 0)` as the position parameter in the `paste` method for the background image.
2. Adding `buf.seek(0)` to move the buffer pointer to the beginning before returning the image and buffer.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
