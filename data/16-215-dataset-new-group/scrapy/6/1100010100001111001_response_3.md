The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle all scenarios for image conversion correctly. Based on the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, the bugs in the function can be located:

1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the conversion for the image with size is incorrect. The function is not properly handling the given size for the image conversion.

2. In Case 3, the function is not correctly handling the PNG format with RGBA mode. It tries to convert to RGB directly, which might result in an incorrect image.

3. In Case 4, the function does not accurately handle images with the mode set to 'P'. It should check this mode and convert accordingly.

To fix the bugs in the function, the following strategy can be used:

1. Check the condition for the image size and handle it properly for image conversion.

2. Add a check for PNG format with RGBA mode and convert it to RGB properly.

3. Add a condition to handle the mode 'P' and convert it as required.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle all the different image formats and modes correctly based on the given input parameters and produce the expected output values.
