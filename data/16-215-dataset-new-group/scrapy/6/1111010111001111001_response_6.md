The bug in the provided function in the `ImagesPipeline` class causes the function `convert_image` to return incorrect output when handling images with transparency or different modes. The buggy function does not correctly handle the alpha channel in PNG images and also fails to convert images with mode 'P' (palette) to RGB, which the failing test is trying to cover.


The bug is mainly located in the condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode where it creates a new background and pastes the image onto it without considering the alpha channel. Additionally, it doesn't handle images with mode 'P' correctly.
To resolve this issue, we need to add a check for the alpha channel in the PNG image and consider the transparency while pasting onto the background. Also, we should explicitly convert images with mode 'P' to RGB before thumbnailing.


A corrected version of the function is presented below:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function checks for the PNG format and RGBA mode and creates a new background with an alpha channel, properly pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. It also properly converts images with mode 'P' to RGB before thumbnailing. This should fix the bugs and make the failing tests pass while satisfying the expected input/output values.
