The buggy function has an issue with converting RGBA PNG images and resizing images to create thumbnails. The bug is causing the test case to fail because the function is not handling RGBA images correctly and is not creating thumbnails of the correct size.

The main issue in the buggy function lies in the conditional statement for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and image mode is 'RGBA'. Here, the function fails to handle the proper conversion of the RGBA image to RGB mode. Additionally, the resizing of the image to create a thumbnail is not performed accurately.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statements and address the issue of creating thumbnails of incorrect sizes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- When the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', we create a new RGB background and paste the RGBA image onto it, then assign it back to the original image variable.
- The thumbnail size creation logic has been optimized to accurately preserve the image ratio when creating thumbnails.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
