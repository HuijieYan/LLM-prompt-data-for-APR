The bug in the `convert_image` function appears to be related to the handling of images with transparency. 

When the input `image` has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the input image onto it. It then converts the resulting image to mode 'RGB'. However, this process is incorrect for images with transparency, as the transparent parts will be filled with white before converting to RGB, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle transparent images, ensuring that the alpha channel is preserved during the conversion.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a transparent background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 0))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        
        # Convert the background to RGB while preserving transparency
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that transparency is preserved when converting images from PNG to JPEG, and should pass the failing test cases.
