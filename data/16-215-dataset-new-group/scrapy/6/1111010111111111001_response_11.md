The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be in the handling of images with transparency and converting them to RGB format. The function currently converts PNG images with transparency to RGB format without discarding the alpha channel, which can introduce unexpected results. Additionally, there are some issues with the thumbnail size and output saving.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle images with transparency and to ensure that the thumbnail size is maintained. Additionally, the output format should be determined based on the input format rather than hardcoding it to JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Discard the alpha channel when converting to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert to RGB if not already in RGB format
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    # Create a copy of the image to apply thumbnail operation
    image_copy = image.copy()

    if size:
        # Resize the image to the specified thumbnail size
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Create a buffer to save the image
    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Save the image with the original format
    image_copy.save(buf, image.format)
    
    # Reset the pointer of the buffer to the beginning
    buf.seek(0)
    
    # Return the converted image and the buffer
    return image_copy, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function ensures that images with transparency are correctly converted to RGB format, handles thumbnail sizing, and saves the image in its original format. It should now pass the failing test cases.
