The buggy function `convert_image` is not properly handling the case when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode. In this case, it creates a new background image and attempts to paste the original image onto it, but it doesn't properly handle the alpha channel, resulting in the incorrect conversion.

A potential fix for this bug would be to properly handle the alpha channel when creating the background image and pasting the original image onto it.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha channel for the background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles the alpha channel properly when creating the background image and pasting the original image onto it, ensuring that the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode is done correctly.
