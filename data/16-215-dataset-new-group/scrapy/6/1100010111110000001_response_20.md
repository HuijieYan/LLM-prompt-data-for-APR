Based on the failing test and the error message, the bug in the `convert_image` function is likely related to the handling of images with transparency. The error message specifically states that there is a difference in the colors when the image is converted, and the failing test cases are related to images with transparency (RGBA and PNG).

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle the transparency of PNG images with the RGBA mode.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency is properly handled and that the function converts RGBA images to RGB while preserving the alpha channel, which is responsible for transparency in the image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the image mode is RGBA or P (palette), and then converts these images to RGB to handle transparency. The rest of the function remains the same, and it should now pass the failing test cases.
