The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the test to fail, specifically when dealing with RGBA images in PNG format. The function is not correctly handling the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format. This is evident from the error message which shows that the expected result of the conversion is not being met.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is attempting to handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format, but the implementation is incorrect. Additionally, the conversion is not handling the transparency correctly which is causing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `convert_image` function to correctly handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format and ensure that transparency is handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the conditional block for converting RGBA images to RGB format has been updated to handle transparency correctly, and the type of image created using `Image.new` has been changed to 'RGB'. Additionally, the unnecessary `.convert('RGB')` has been removed from the function, as it is not needed.

These changes should ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format, and the transparency is also properly handled. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
