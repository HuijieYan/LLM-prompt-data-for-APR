The bug in the `convert_image` function is that the conditional statement that checks if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'` doesn't handle the conversion properly. The conversion of a PNG image with an RGBA mode should flatten the transparencies correctly, but the current code pastes the image onto a white background and then converts it to RGB, which causes the transparency information to be lost.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should handle PNG images with an RGBA mode by flattening the transparencies properly before converting to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.load()  # Load the image
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGB image with a white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the white background
        image = background  # Use the new image with the white background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles PNG images with an RGBA mode by using the `load()` method to ensure the image is loaded before pasting it onto a white background. This preserves the transparency information before converting the image to RGB.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases.
