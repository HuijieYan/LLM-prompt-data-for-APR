The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the incorrect handling of image mode and transparency. When the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new background and pastes the original image onto it. However, this operation should retain the transparency of the original image, which is not currently happening.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code so that when the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function keeps transparency in the resulting image.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Ensure the image mode is RGBA
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle image transparency, ensuring that the resulting thumbnail image retains transparency when the input format is PNG and mode is RGBA.
