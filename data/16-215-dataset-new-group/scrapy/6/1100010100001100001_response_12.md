The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly checks the format and mode of the image and tries to convert it to RGB or JPEG without considering the input parameters. Additionally, there is a potential problem with creating and pasting a background image. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then create a white background and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. We should also check if the image mode is not RGB and convert it. Finally, we will resize the image if a size is provided and then save it as a JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This fixed version now properly handles the input parameters and correctly converts images based on their format and mode.
