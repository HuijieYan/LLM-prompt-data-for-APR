# The corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the provided buggy function, there are a few issues to be addressed:

1. In the first condition where `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the background should be created with the 'RGB' mode instead of 'RGBA'. Also, the way the image is pasted onto the background needs to be corrected.
2. The use of `image` inside the `past()` method is incorrect. It should be `(0, 0)` as the second parameter.
3. The condition `image.mode != 'RGB'` seems to convert the image mode to 'RGB', but the function should handle the 'RGBA' mode as well.

After fixing these issues, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
