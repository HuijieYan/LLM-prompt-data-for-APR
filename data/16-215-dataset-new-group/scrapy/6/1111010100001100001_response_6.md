The bug in the 'convert_image' function is that it incorrectly converts images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. It also improperly converts images with different modes to 'RGB' when a specific size is given.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', and the forced conversion to 'RGB' when a size is provided, regardless of the original format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' correctly, and only convert the image to 'RGB' if the original format and mode are different.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' by creating a new RGBA background and then pasting the original image onto it. We also removed the unnecessary conversion to 'RGB' when a specific size is given, and instead, only convert the image if the original mode is different.
