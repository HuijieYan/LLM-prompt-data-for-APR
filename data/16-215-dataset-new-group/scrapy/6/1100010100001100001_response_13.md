The bug in the function is caused by incorrect handling of the input image format and mode. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function attempts to convert it to 'RGB' without changing the mode to 'RGB'. This results in the image mode remaining as 'RGBA' even after the conversion, leading to incorrect image processing.

To fix this bug, the function should explicitly convert the image to 'RGB' and also change the mode to 'RGB' when necessary. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the input image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is not 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
