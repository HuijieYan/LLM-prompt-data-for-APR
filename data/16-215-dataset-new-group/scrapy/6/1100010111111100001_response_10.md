The buggy function has several potential error locations. The first potential location is the conditional statements that check for the image format and mode. The second potential location is the use of the paste() method to blend the image with a new background. Finally, the use of the thumbnail() method to resize the image may also have errors.

The cause of the bug is due to the conditional statements not handling all possible image format and mode combinations. This causes the function to incorrectly convert images and produce unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle different image format and mode combinations, as well as ensure that the blending and resizing operations are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'):
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif (image.mode != 'RGB'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we update the conditional statements to handle both PNG and RGB image formats with RGBA and P modes. We also fix the use of the paste() method to blend the image with a new background. Finally, we ensure that the thumbnail() method resizes the image correctly.

This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
