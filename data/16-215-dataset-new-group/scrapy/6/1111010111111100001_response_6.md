The buggy function `convert_image` has a bug when converting images with transparency, as seen in the failing test cases with PNG images and RGBA mode. The bug occurs when the function checks the format and mode of the input image and tries to convert it to RGB. The function fails to properly handle transparency and converts transparent images to RGB incorrectly.

The bug is causing the failing test cases to have incorrect values and types of the returned `converted` image, which leads to the AssertionError described in the error message.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle transparency correctly and convert images with transparency to RGB without losing transparency information.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle images with transparency, preserving the alpha channel when converting to RGB. This should resolve the failing test cases and prevent the previously observed AssertionError.

After making this correction, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output without errors or exceptions.
