The bug in the `convert_image` function is with the condition where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the code creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. However, it should simply convert it to RGB without creating a new background.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition that handles PNG images with the RGBA mode.

```python
# The corrected version of the convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Update the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By simply converting the image to RGB directly when the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, this should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
