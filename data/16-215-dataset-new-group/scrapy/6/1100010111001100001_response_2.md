The bug in the given function arises from the incorrect conversion of images with RGBA mode and PNG format to RGB, as well as an incorrect conversion of images with mode other than RGB. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the image size when creating a thumbnail.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format, images with mode other than RGB, and thumbnail sizes. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have made changes to the handling of images with RGBA mode and PNG format by creating a new RGB background and pasting the image onto it. We have also updated the conversion of images with mode other than RGB to directly convert them to RGB. Additionally, we have removed the unnecessary use of the `Image.ANTIALIAS` parameter when creating a thumbnail, as it is the default parameter for the thumbnail method.
