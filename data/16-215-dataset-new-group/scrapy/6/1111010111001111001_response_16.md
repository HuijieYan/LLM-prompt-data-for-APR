The issue with the `convert_image` function is that the conditional statements are not handling all scenarios properly. Additionally, after converting the image to RGB mode, it is not resized properly in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle all scenarios properly and ensure that the image is resized correctly after the mode conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
