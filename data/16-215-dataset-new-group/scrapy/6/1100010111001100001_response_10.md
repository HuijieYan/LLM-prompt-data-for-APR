The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely in the first conditional statement, where it checks for the image format and mode and applies specific image conversions. The bug might also be related to the use of `Image.ANTIALIAS` when resizing the image.

The bug causes the failing tests because it leads to incorrect image formats or sizes which do not match the expected outcomes. In particular, the first case for a JPEG image with RGB mode size of 100x100 returns an image in the RGB mode with the size of 10x10, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the image format and mode checks are correctly implemented and that the image resizing is performed accurately in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statement has been modified to correctly handle the PNG and RGBA case by creating a new RGB background and pasting the image onto it only using the alpha channel. Additionally, the image format and mode checks have been refined, and the image resizing has been fixed to maintain aspect ratio. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
