Since the failing tests focus on image mode and format handling, the bug might be related to the code section that checks for the PNG format and RGBA mode to convert to RGB.
The bug occurs when the function tries to convert an RGBA image of format PNG to RGB. The code incorrectly pastes the RGBA image onto a new RGBA background and then converts it to RGB.

The bug is caused because the background image created is in RGBA format, and when pasting the original image onto it, the transparency of the original image is not applied. Then, converting that to RGB results in a flawed image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block for PNG RGBA images. We should create an RGB background, paste the original RGBA image on it, and avoid the unnecessary conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
