The bug in the `convert_image` function is due to incorrect handling of different image formats and modes. The function assumes that all images with a format of 'PNG' and mode of 'RGBA' need to be converted to 'RGB'. This assumption is incorrect, as we need to handle each case independently.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditionals in the function to correctly handle the image format and mode. We should also ensure that the size argument is handled properly for thumbnail creation.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass and return the expected values.
