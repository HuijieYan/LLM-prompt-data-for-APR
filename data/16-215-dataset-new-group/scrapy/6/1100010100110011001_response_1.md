The issue in the provided `convert_image` function is that the condition to check for PNG and RGBA format images is not being properly handled. This is causing the conversion to RGB mode to fail, leading to the test cases failing as well. The buggy function incorrectly converts RGBA format images to RGB by simply creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on it.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode properly. We also need to ensure that the image conversion is done correctly when a size is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function, we have changed the condition to check for PNG and RGBA format images to include the 'P' mode as well. This is because PNG images with transparency can be stored in the 'P' mode. We also removed the unnecessary call to `convert('RGB')` after creating the white background for PNG and RGBA images.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
