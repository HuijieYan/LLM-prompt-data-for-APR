Based on the error message provided, the failing test is asserting that the converted image object does not match the expected value. This suggests that the `convert_image` function is not properly handling the conversion of the image. 

The bug is likely caused by the logic in the `convert_image` function that is not correctly converting images with certain formats or modes. Specifically, the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode seems to be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we'll need to adjust the image conversion logic to correctly handle the given input image and its format/mode. We'll specifically address the PNG and RGBA mode conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        # Convert to RGB mode if not already
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize to the specified size
        in_memory_file = BytesIO()
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image_copy.save(in_memory_file, 'JPEG')
        in_memory_file.seek(0)
        return image_copy, in_memory_file

    else:
        in_memory_file = BytesIO()
        image.save(in_memory_file, 'JPEG')
        in_memory_file.seek(0)
        return image, in_memory_file
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now handle image format and mode conversions properly, addressing the issues identified in the failing test.
