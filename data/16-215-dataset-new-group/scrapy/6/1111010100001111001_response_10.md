The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the if-elif-else block, as the conditions are not mutually exclusive. This leads to behaviors that don't align with the expected outcomes.

To fix the bug, we need to restructure the if-elif-else block so that the conditions are mutually exclusive.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, I removed the `elif` and `else` statements, so that the function now checks for each condition independently of the others. This allows for exclusive behavior based on each condition's outcome.

This new version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values.
