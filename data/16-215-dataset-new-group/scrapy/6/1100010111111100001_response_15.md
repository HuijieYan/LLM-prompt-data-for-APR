The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle the transparency of PNG images correctly. It checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, but it doesn't take into account the transparency channel when pasting the image onto a white background.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the RGBA mode and transparency correctly by using the `paste` function with a mask.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle PNG images with transparency correctly, and the failing test should pass.
