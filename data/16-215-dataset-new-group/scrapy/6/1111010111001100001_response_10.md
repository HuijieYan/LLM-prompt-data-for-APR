The bug in the provided function is causing the failing test because the function is not handling images with a palette mode properly. The function is unable to correctly convert images with a palette to RGB mode, causing the failing test cases that include images with a palette to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to handle images with a palette mode separately, ensuring that they are converted to RGB mode correctly before performing any further operations.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':  # Handle palette mode separately
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles images with a palette mode, converting them to RGB mode before further operations. This should resolve the failing test cases and ensure the function works as intended.
