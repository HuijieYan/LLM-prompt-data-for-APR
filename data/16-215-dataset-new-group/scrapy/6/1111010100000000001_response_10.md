The buggy function `convert_image` is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class. It takes an input `image` and an optional `size` parameter, and is used to convert an image to a specified format and size.

1. Potential errors in the buggy function:
   - The conditional check for `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` might be incorrect.
   - The method of pasting the image may be incorrect, leading to unexpected results.
   - Image format conversion and thumbnail creation may not work as intended.

2. The cause of the bug can be analyzed from the docs of the `PIL` library and `cStringIO` module. The image format and mode conversions, as well as the thumbnail creation logic, need to be handled carefully to avoid incorrect results.

3. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the conditional checks for image format and mode based on the correct attribute names and values.
   - Use the appropriate method for pasting images and ensure the correct mode and format conversions.
   - Handle thumbnail creation carefully, ensuring that the output is as expected.

4. Corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the position of the buffer to the beginning
    return image, buf
```
In the corrected version of the function:
   - The `paste` method is used with correct arguments to paste the image onto the background.
   - The created thumbnail image is now returned along with the buffer.

By making these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now work correctly and handle image format conversion, mode conversion, and thumbnail creation as expected.
