The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of images with transparency (Alpha channel). The error message suggests that the function is not handling the Alpha channel correctly and the resulting RGB image's colors are different from the expected values.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the bug occurs when the input image is of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', and the function tries to convert it to RGB. The issue arises when the conversion from RGBA to RGB is done without taking into account the transparency values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a white background image
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        
        # Composite the original image onto the white background, to handle the alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        
        # Convert the composited image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # If the image is not in RGB mode, convert it to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # If a size is provided, create a copy of the image and resize it
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, when the input image is of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', we create a white background image and composite the original image onto the white background to handle the alpha channel. Then, we convert the composited image to RGB, ensuring that the transparency is correctly handled.

This should fix the bug and make the function correctly handle images with transparency, ensuring that the resulting RGB image matches the expected values.
