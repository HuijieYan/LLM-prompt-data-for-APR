The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to process images by converting them to RGB mode and resizing them if necessary. However, the bug is causing it to fail the test cases, specifically when dealing with PNG and RGBA images. The cause of the bug is related to the handling of transparency in RGBA images and the conversion process.

The conversion process should be modified to properly handle transparency in images and perform the necessary conversions to RGB mode. Additionally, the handling of size and thumbnail generation might also need adjustment.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling PNG and RGBA images, as well as ensuring that the size and thumbnail generation work as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Apply the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks whether the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. If so, it creates a new RGB image with a white background and applies the alpha channel as a mask. Then, it converts the image to RGB mode and proceeds with resizing if necessary.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
