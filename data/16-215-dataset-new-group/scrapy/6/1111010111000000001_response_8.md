Here's the corrected version of the function "convert_image" with a fix to address the bug in the original version:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the buffer before returning
    return image, buf
```

Explanation of bug:
The original buggy function contains a few issues:
1. The paste method on the "background" image did not specify the position of the image to be pasted. This could lead to a TypeError.
2. For images with mode 'P' (palette) and format 'PNG', the original function did not handle the case properly.
3. After saving the image to the buffer, the file pointer was not repositioned to the beginning, which could cause the buffer to be read incorrectly.

Fix strategy:
1. Address the TypeError issue by providing the position for the image to be pasted on the background image.
2. Handle the case of images with mode 'P' and format 'PNG' by not converting them to RGB but keeping the original mode.
3. Reposition the file pointer to the beginning of the buffer after saving the image.

The corrected version of the function addresses all of the issues mentioned above and should pass the failing test.
