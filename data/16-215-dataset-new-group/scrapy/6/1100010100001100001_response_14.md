The bug in the function is that it does not handle the case where the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'P'. This causes the function to always convert the image to 'RGB' format, regardless of the input image format and mode.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to handle the case where the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'P', and only perform the conversion if the image mode is not 'RGB'. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' to ensure that the background is created properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and not (image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'P'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This version of the function handles the different image formats and modes correctly, and should now produce the expected output for the given input cases.
