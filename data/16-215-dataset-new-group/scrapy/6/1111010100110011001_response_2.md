The bug in the provided code is that when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new image with an RGBA mode, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. However, this process changes the transparency values of the image, causing the test case to fail.

To fix this bug, the function `convert_image` needs to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently to retain the transparency values. The `Image` class from the PIL library provides the `paste` method which can handle this by creating a new image with RGBA mode and pasting the original image onto it, without changing the transparency values.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The changes made in the corrected version include:
1. Checking if the image mode is 'RGBA' instead of checking the image format.
2. Creating a new RGBA image using the `Image.new` method.
3. Pasting the original image onto the new background using the `paste` method to retain transparency.
4. Returning the modified image along with the buffer.
