The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect conditional statement in the first if block which checks for image format and mode.
2. Incorrect usage of the paste() method within the first if block.
3. Improper handling of the image size when creating the thumbnail.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the conditional statement for PNG format and RGBA mode is not evaluated correctly. Additionally, the paste() method is not used properly, and the image size is not properly handled when creating the thumbnail.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional statement for PNG format and RGBA mode and use the paste() method correctly. Additionally, we should handle the image size properly when creating the thumbnail.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the start
    return image, buf
```
