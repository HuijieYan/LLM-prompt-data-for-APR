The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the image format and mode handling. It also seems to have an issue when dealing with the size parameter.

The potential error locations in the code are the conditions for checking the image format and mode, and also the image resizing logic.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the image format and mode, and improperly resizes the image.

To fix the bug, we can revise the conditions for checking the image format and mode, and also modify the image resizing logic to ensure it behaves as expected for different image modes and sizes.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif (image.format != 'JPEG'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- We remove the condition for checking the image mode when the format is PNG. Instead, we directly convert the image to RGB for PNG format.
- We also remove the unnecessary condition for checking the image mode when the format is not JPEG, and directly convert the image to RGB in that case as well.
- We modify the resizing logic by using the `resize` method instead of `thumbnail`, and passing the `size` parameter directly to it.

This revised version should now handle different image formats, modes, and sizes correctly.
