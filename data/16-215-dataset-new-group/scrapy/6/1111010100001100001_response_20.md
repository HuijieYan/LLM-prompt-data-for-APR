The main issue in the buggy function is the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. It leads to a bug when the format is not equal to 'PNG' or the mode is not equal to 'RGBA' and therefore fails to convert the image properly when the size is given.

The following is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

I have modified the function to create a new RGB background when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', then pasted the original image onto the new background, and converted the image to RGB mode. When the size is given, I copied the image, created a thumbnail, and saved the image as 'JPEG' in the buffer.

These changes should address the issues introduced by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode and correctly manage the image conversion and size manipulation.
