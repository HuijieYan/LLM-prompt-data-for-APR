The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test because the function is not correctly handling images with transparency (RGBA) and images that are not in the RGB mode.

The bug is due to incorrect handling in the code logic when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The code should create a new background image and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. Additionally, the function should check if the image mode is not 'RGB' and convert it. These checks and conversions are not being done correctly, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the code logic for handling the different image modes and formats needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position before returning
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', a new RGBA background is created and the input image is pasted onto it before conversion to RGB. Additionally, the background has an alpha channel (transparency). Then the image is checked for mode and converted to RGB if necessary. Finally, the thumbnail (if specified) is created and the image is saved to a buffer with the correct format. The buffer position is reset before returning it.
