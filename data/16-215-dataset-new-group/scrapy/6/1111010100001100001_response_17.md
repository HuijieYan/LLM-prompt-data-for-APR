The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how the image format and mode are handled. It appears that the function is not converting images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' to 'RGB', as intended.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. Incorrect conditional statements for checking image format and mode.
2. Inadequate image conversion logic when the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for converting images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' to 'RGB' is not properly implemented. This results in incorrect image format and mode in the returned image, which is causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be updated to correctly handle the conversion of images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' to 'RGB'.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
In the corrected version, the condition for checking the image format and mode has been updated. Additionally, the image conversion logic for 'PNG' and 'RGBA' images has been modified to ensure that the images are properly converted to 'RGB'.
