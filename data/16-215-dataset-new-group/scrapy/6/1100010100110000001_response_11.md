The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert images to the JPEG format and return the converted image along with the byte stream. The test case is failing with an error message related to lists of colors not matching.

The potential error locations in the function include the conditionals for checking the image format and mode, as well as the actual conversion and thumbnail creation steps.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA) and is not handling the palette mode (P) properly, leading to incorrect results and causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle images with transparency and palette mode. This involves adding an additional condition to handle RGBA and P modes, and performing the conversion and thumbnail creation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageOps
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
  
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should properly handle images with transparency and palette mode, and is expected to pass the failing test.
