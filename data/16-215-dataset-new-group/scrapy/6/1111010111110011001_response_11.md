The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not correctly handle images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. Instead, it converts them to RGB mode, causing the failing test to produce an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'convert_image' function so that it correctly handles images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' by preserving their mode and format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' appropriately, preserving their mode and format when resizing. It also saves the image using its original format, or defaults to 'JPEG' if the format is empty. This fixed version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
