The bug here seems to be in the `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class. The function is designed to convert an image, with a specific size, to the 'JPEG' format. However, in the case of images with RGBA mode and PNG format, it attempts to convert the image to RGB and then save it as JPEG, but the test is expecting the RGB values to change.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. It creates a new 'RGBA' image with a white background and pastes the original image onto it, then converts the image to 'RGB' mode, and finally, it saves the converted image as JPEG. When the original image is an RGBA mode PNG with transparency, the conversion to RGB mode and saving as JPEG discards the transparency information, leading to a change in RGB values and causing the failing test.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently. Instead of just converting the image to RGB and saving it as JPEG, the function should use a different approach to preserve the transparency and colors.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency when converting PNG with RGBA mode
        new_image = Image.new("RGBA", image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save image in PNG format to preserve transparency
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, when the input image is a PNG with RGBA mode, we create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image, including its transparency, onto the new image. Then, we save the image in PNG format to preserve the transparency. For other cases, we convert the image to RGB and handle the thumbnail resizing as before.

This corrected version should handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and pass the failing test.
