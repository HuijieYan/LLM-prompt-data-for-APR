The bug is likely to be in the conditional logic that checks the image format and mode. The bug seems to be causing the returned image to be in a different mode than expected.

The bug is specifically caused by the conditional logic that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the image mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. This process seems to be causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the conditional logic to handle images with different modes and formats more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
