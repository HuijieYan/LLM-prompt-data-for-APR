The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of transparency in PNG images. When the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode, the function is not correctly converting it to RGB format, which leads to incorrect output and causes the failing tests.

The bug is likely in the conditional statement that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. It does not seem to correctly convert the image to RGB mode before processing it further.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement that checks for the PNG and RGBA mode, and add the necessary code to convert the image to RGB mode before continuing with the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the input image is in RGBA mode and PNG format by creating a new RGB background and pasting the RGBA image onto it with the alpha mask. We also handle the conversion to RGB mode for other image formats as needed.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
