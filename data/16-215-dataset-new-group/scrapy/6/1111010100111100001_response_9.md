The issue with the buggy function `convert_image` is that it does not handle the transparency case properly when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. This causes the test to fail.

The bug is specifically in the condition:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```
In this condition, the image is pasted onto a new RGBA background, and then the image is converted to RGB mode. This does not preserve the transparency of the original image.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for image format and mode 'PNG' and 'RGBA' should be modified to properly handle the transparency case and preserve the alpha channel.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version of the function, the transparency case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' will be properly handled, and the tests should pass without any errors.
