The buggy function is intended to convert an image to the RGB mode and handle different scenarios based on the image format and mode. However, there are a few bugs in the function that need to be fixed.

1. The buggy function does not handle the case when the input image format is already 'JPEG' and mode is 'RGB' properly. It ends up converting the image unnecessarily, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. The function may not be correctly generating the thumbnail of the image when a size is provided as an input.

The cause of the error message is that the buggy function is not correctly handling the conversion and thumbnail generation for different image formats and modes. This causes the test cases to fail, as the output of the function is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the conversion and thumbnail generation for different image formats and modes. Specifically, the following changes are needed:
1. Update the condition for checking if the image format is 'JPEG' and mode is 'RGB', and remove the unnecessary conversion.
2. Ensure that the thumbnail generation is correctly resizing the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle different image formats and modes correctly and pass the failing test cases.
