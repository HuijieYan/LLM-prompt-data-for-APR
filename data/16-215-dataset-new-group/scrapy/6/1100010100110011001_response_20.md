The buggy function is `convert_image`, and it is designed to convert and resize images. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the returned value does not match the expected value.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statement to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
2. The logic to convert the image to RGB when the mode is not 'RGB'.
3. Resizing the image using the `thumbnail` method.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement to check for PNG format and RGBA mode is incorrect, leading to incorrect image conversion. Additionally, the resizing of the image might not be maintaining the aspect ratio.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statement and ensure that the image resizing maintains the aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional statement for PNG format and RGBA mode has been fixed to correctly handle transparency. Additionally, we have modified the `background.paste` method to specify the position to paste the image. Lastly, we have ensured that image resizing maintains the aspect ratio. This should address the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
