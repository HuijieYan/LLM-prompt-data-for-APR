## Corrections
The buggy function is the `convert_image` method inside the `ImagesPipeline` class. There are several potential error locations within this function, including the condition to check for image format and mode, as well as the `save` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling images with the PNG format and RGBA mode, as well as not correctly checking for the RGB mode. Additionally, the `save` method is always saving the image in JPEG format, which may not be the desired behavior.

To fix the bug, we should update the image format and mode checks to handle PNG with RGBA mode correctly, and use the parameterized image format when saving the image.

## Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```
