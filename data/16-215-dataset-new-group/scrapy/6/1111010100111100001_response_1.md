The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the logic for converting the image background and mode. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function is supposed to create a new background image and then convert the original image to 'RGB'. However, it seems that the background image is not being created or used correctly.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the background image is created properly and that the original image is pasted onto it before converting it to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making sure that the original image is pasted onto the background image with the correct position, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
