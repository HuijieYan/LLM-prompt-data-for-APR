The main issue with the `convert_image` function is that it fails to handle PNG images with an RGBA mode correctly. Specifically, it creates a new RGBA image with a white background, then converts it to an RGB image, causing incorrect color information. We need to ensure that when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode, we maintain the transparency while converting it to an RGB image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle PNG images with RGBA mode separately.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted = image.convert("RGB").convert("P", palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)
    else:
        converted = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        converted.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    converted.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return converted, buf
```

This corrected version handles PNG images with an RGBA mode by converting them to RGB images, preserving the alpha channel's information. This should fix the failing test as well as satisfy the expected input/output values.
