The bug in the `convert_image` function is caused by the logic for handling PNG images with an RGBA mode. When a PNG image with RGBA mode is encountered, the function creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image onto it. It then converts the resulting image to RGB mode. However, the bug is that the original image is pasted onto the background image in an incorrect manner, and therefore, the resulting converted image is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the original image is pasted onto the background image correctly. We will also need to handle the case where the image mode is 'P', which is not being considered in the current logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class Pipeline:
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

The changes made to fix the bug include:
- When handling a PNG image with RGBA mode, we create a new RGB background image and paste the original image onto it using the correct method (`background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`).
- We also considered the case where the image mode is 'P', and converted the image to RGB mode in that case.

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now produce the correct output and pass the failing tests.
