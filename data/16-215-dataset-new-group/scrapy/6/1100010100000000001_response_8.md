## Analysis:
The buggy function is meant to convert images to the JPEG format, resize them if needed, and return the modified image along with the byte stream. However, it contains several potential error locations, such as incorrect image format checks and incorrect usage of the `paste` method.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect checking of image format and mode.
2. Incorrect use of the `paste` method.
3. Saving the image to JPEG format without ensuring the image mode is RGB.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks the image format and mode, and uses the `paste` method incorrectly. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the image mode is properly converted to RGB before saving it as a JPEG.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly check the image format and mode.
2. Use the `paste` method correctly if needed.
3. Ensure the image mode is properly converted to RGB before saving it as JPEG.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Specify the format parameter
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer to the start
    return image, buf
```
