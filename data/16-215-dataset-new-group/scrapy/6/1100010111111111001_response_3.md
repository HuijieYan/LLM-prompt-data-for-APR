The buggy function has two main issues. First, the logic for converting RGBA PNG images to RGB is not correctly handling transparency. Second, it is saving all images as JPEG regardless of their original format.

The first issue is that when the image is RGBA and it is converted to RGB, the transparency is not properly handled. This results in incorrect color values in the image, causing the failing tests.

The second issue is that the function saves all images as JPEG, ignoring their original format.

To fix the first issue, the transparent areas in RGBA images need to be properly handled during the conversion to RGB.

To fix the second issue, the function should respect the original format of the image when saving it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)  # Save using the original format
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now handles RGBA transparency correctly when converting to RGB, and it preserves the original image format when saving.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
