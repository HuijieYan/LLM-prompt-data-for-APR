The buggy function `convert_image` has the following issues:
1. It fails to correctly handle images with transparency and/or different modes.
2. It should be returning the buffer along with the image.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle transparency and different image modes properly, leading to incorrect converted images.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles images with transparency and different modes.
2. Update the function to return the buffer along with the image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that images with transparency and different modes are handled correctly. Additionally, it returns the buffer along with the image.
