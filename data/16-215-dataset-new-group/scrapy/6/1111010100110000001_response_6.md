The error occurs in the `convert_image` method of the `ImagesPipeline` class. The error message indicates that the expected colors after the image conversion do not match the actual colors, causing the test to fail.

The bug is likely related to the image format and mode conversions. The bug causes the function to return an incorrect image that does not match the expected colors, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the image format and mode conversions are handled correctly based on the given input image. Additionally, the thumbnail size needs to be preserved to maintain the image ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Convert image to RGBA if it's PNG and mode is RGBA
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Use BytesIO from io module instead of from cStringIO
    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in the original format
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected version, we ensure that the image is correctly converted based on its format and mode. Additionally, we use the `image.format` attribute to save the image in the original format to avoid unnecessary format conversions. We also use `BytesIO` from the `io` module instead of `cStringIO` since `cStringIO` is not available in Python 3.

After applying these corrections, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test.
