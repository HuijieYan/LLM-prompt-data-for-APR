The bug seems to be in the 'convert_image' function, where the incorrect image format is being used when saving the image. In the PIL library, 'JPEG' images do not support transparency, which is why the tests are failing.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to save the image in the original format, instead of hardcoding it to 'JPEG'.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in its original format
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By using the original image format when saving, we ensure that the transparency information is preserved for PNG images, which should fix the failing tests.
