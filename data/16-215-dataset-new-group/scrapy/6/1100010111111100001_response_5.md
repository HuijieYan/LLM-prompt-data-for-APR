The buggy function `convert_image` has issues with handling image formats and modes, as well as with resizing images. 

The bug in this function is likely to be caused by the conditional statements where the image mode and format are checked. There might also be issues with resizing the image.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle different image modes and formats, and ensure that the resizing of images is done properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the BytesIO to the start before returning
    return image, buf
```

The changes made include fixing the `paste` method to include the position argument, and adding `buf.seek(0)` to move the BytesIO to the start before returning.

These changes should ensure that the function handles different image formats, modes, and resizing properly.
