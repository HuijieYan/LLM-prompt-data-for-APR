The issue with the buggy function lies in the conditional statement that checks the `format` and `mode` of the input image. The code attempts to handle different image formats and modes but has incorrect logic.

The bug occurs when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA image with a white background and pastes the input image onto it. Then, it converts the resulting image to 'RGB' mode. However, this approach is incorrect, as it should preserve the transparency of the original image.

To fix the bug, we should correctly handle the case of 'PNG' mode and 'RGBA' format, which requires preserving the transparency of the image. We can do this by modifying the conditional statement to correctly handle RGBA images while preserving transparency, and by updating the final save format to 'PNG' for these images.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create RGBA background with full alpha
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image with alpha onto the background
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.mode == 'RGBA': 
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')  # Save as PNG to preserve transparency
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format, preserving the transparency when converting or resizing the images.
