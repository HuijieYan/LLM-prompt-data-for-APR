The buggy function has several issues:

1. It incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB by replacing transparency with a white background, instead of removing transparency.
2. It does not take into consideration images with mode 'P' or 'RGB' and format 'PNG'.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Check if the image mode is 'RGBA' and format is 'PNG', and then remove the transparency by using the `convert('RGB')` function.
2. Check if the image mode is not 'RGB' and then convert it to 'RGB'.
3. If a size is provided, generate a thumbnail of the image to the provided size using `thumbnail()` function.
4. Save the modified image in JPEG format to a BytesIO buffer and return both the image and the buffer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# this is the corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
