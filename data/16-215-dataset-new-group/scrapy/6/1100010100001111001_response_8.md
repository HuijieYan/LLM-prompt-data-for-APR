The bug in the buggy function occurs due to incorrect handling of the input image. Specifically, the function should convert images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB' before resizing the image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that it correctly checks the image format and mode, and converts the image as necessary before resizing and saving it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle images with different formats and modes and resize and save them as expected.
