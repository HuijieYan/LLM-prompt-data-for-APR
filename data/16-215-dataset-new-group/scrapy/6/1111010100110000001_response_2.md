The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test.

The error message shows that there is a difference in the list of colors returned by the `convert_image` function. Specifically, the expected result is `[(10000, (205, 230, 255))]` but the actual result is `[(10000, (0, 127, 255))]`.

From the code, it's clear that the bug is related to the handling of PNG images with transparency channels. The function is converting an RGBA image to RGB and losing the transparency information.

To fix this bug, the function should preserve the transparency information when converting from RGBA to RGB, and also properly handle images that are already in the RGB format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles PNG images with transparency channels by converting them to RGB while preserving the transparency information. It also ensures that images that are already in the RGB format are not unnecessarily converted.
