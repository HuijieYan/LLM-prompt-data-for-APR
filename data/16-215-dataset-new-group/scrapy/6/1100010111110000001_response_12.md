The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a new format and size, and return both the converted image and the image buffer. However, it has a bug that causes it to fail the test. The error message indicates that the color values of the converted image are not as expected, specifically in the getcolors assertion.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect conversion of images with RGBA format to RGB format.
2. Incorrect handling of transparency cases with PNG and P formats.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling images with RGBA format when converting them to RGB format. Additionally, it is not correctly handling transparency cases when converting images with PNG and P formats.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the different image formats and transparency cases. Specifically, it needs to handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB images and handle transparency when converting images with PNG and P formats.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the conversion of RGBA images to RGB images and transparency when converting images with PNG and P formats. This version of the function should pass the failing test.
