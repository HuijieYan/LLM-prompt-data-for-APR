After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the bug arises from the conditional statements within the `convert_image` function. Specifically, the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not handling the transparency case correctly, resulting in incorrect image mode and color values. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the transparency case when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. Additionally, we should ensure that the thumbnail operation keeps the image ratio intact.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these modifications, the `convert_image` function should now handle the transparency case correctly and generate thumbnails while maintaining the image ratio. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
