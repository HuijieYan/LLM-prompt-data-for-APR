The bug in the 'convert_image()' function arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function fails to correctly check for PNG images with RGBA mode and to convert them to RGB mode.

The code failing the test is as follows:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```

The issue here is that the 'background.paste(image, image)' line results in the creation of an opaque background with the original RGBA image pasted on top of it. This leads to the conversion not being performed correctly, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the code needs to correctly paste the original PNG with RGBA image onto the RGB image. Additionally, the bug also lies in the 'image.save(buf, 'JPEG')' line, where the function wrongly tries to save the image as a JPEG, regardless of its original format.

Here's the corrected version of the 'convert_image()' function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by pasting the original image onto an RGB background and saving the image in its original format. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
