The bug in the `convert_image` method is that it wrongly converts the image format in the case where the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. It should preserve the transparency of the image when converting from RGBA to RGB format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conversion process for PNG with RGBA mode to preserve transparency. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the image mode is not RGB or RGBA. We also need to address this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:
        # Convert to RGB mode for other modes (e.g., 'P' or 'L')
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Each case described in the failing test will now be handled correctly, and the function should return the expected results.
