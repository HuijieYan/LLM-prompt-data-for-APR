The buggy function `convert_image` takes an input image and optionally a size, then converts the image to RGB mode, and, if a size is provided, creates a thumbnail of the image with the specified size. However, there are several issues in the implementation that cause it to fail the provided test.

The `convert_image` function has the following potential issues:
1. The conversion of RGBA mode images with an alpha layer to RGB mode is not performed correctly.
2. The thumbnail creation preserves the ratio but does not correctly size the image to match the specified dimensions.
3. There is an issue with saving the image in the JPEG format, causing it to be incorrectly returned.

To fix the issues, the `convert_image` function should be updated to correctly handle images of different modes and create thumbnails with the correct dimensions based on the input size parameter.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Move pointer to the start of the BytesIO buffer
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function correctly handles RGBA mode images with an alpha layer, creates thumbnails with the correct size, and saves the image in the JPEG format. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
