The bug in the `convert_image` function is caused by incorrect handling of transparent PNG images with an alpha channel. The bug is leading to incorrect image conversion which is causing the failing test cases.

The bug is clearly stated in the provided test function, where it expects the converted image to have certain colors and sizes, but the actual values are different.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `convert_image` function need to be updated to properly handle PNG images with an alpha channel.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The updated code checks if the input image is a PNG format and has an alpha channel. If it does, it creates a new RGB image with a white background and pastes the original image onto it, extracting the alpha channel using `image.split()[-1]`. This ensures that the transparency is handled correctly. Then, the image is saved in JPEG format and returned.

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle PNG images with an alpha channel and pass the failing test.
