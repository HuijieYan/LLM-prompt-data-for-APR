## Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert an image to either RGB or JPEG format, and resize the image if a size is provided. The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The `paste` method call within the first conditional block is incorrect.
2. The `save` method call with the first argument 'buf' may not work as expected.
3. The returned buffer is not reset to the beginning.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method and the `save` method, and the failure to reset the buffer position to the beginning before returning it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Correct the arguments for the `paste` method.
- Use format='JPEG' as the argument for the `save` method to clearly specify the output format.
- Reset buffer position to the beginning before returning it.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues.
