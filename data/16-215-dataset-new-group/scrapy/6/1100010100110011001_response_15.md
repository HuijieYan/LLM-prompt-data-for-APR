The buggy function `convert_image` has multiple issues. The first issue is with the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` which checks for the format and mode of the image. The code within this block contains an issue with pasting the image onto a new background. The image should be pasted onto an RGBA background instead of an RGB background. Another issue is with the logic for converting an image to RGB mode.

The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the actual output `converted.getcolors()` does not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode needs to create a new RGBA background instead of just an RGB background. Additionally, the logic for converting an image to RGB mode needs to be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create an RGBA background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer cursor to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function handles PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and ensures that the image is converted to RGB mode when needed. The `buf.seek(0)` command ensures that the buffer cursor is moved to the beginning, allowing the image to be read from the start when it is used elsewhere.
