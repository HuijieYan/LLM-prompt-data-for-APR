The buggy function `convert_image` has the following potential error locations:
1. It does not handle the case where the input image format is JPEG instead of PNG.
2. It incorrectly converts the image to RGB when the input format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
3. When saving the image in the 'JPEG' format, it does not consider the transparency of the input image.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the different image formats and modes properly, leading to incorrect conversions, especially when dealing with transparency.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle different image formats and modes, as well as consider transparency when saving the image in the 'JPEG' format.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.mode == 'RGBA' or 'transparency' in image.info:
        image.save(buf, 'PNG', transparency=0)
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where the input format is PNG and the mode is RGBA or P separately. We also handle transparency when saving the image in the 'PNG' format, and ensure that the function considers the transparency information properly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
