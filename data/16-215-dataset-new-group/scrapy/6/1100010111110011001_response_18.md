The bug in the provided code is that the function `convert_image` is not handling transparent images correctly. It converts RGBA images to RGB mode, but it should handle the alpha channel correctly.

In particular, the bug occurs in the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. This condition indicates that if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the image should be converted to RGB mode. However, this approach does not properly handle transparent images.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the image has an alpha channel. If it does, it should create a new image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. This will ensure that the transparency is preserved when converting the image to RGB mode. Additionally, the function should keep the original mode if it is already RGB.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should handle transparent images correctly and pass the failing test case.
