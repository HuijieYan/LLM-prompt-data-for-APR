The issue in the `convert_image` function is that it is not properly handling images with RGBA mode and PNG format, which leads to incorrect image conversions and failing tests.

The main problem lies in the conditional block for PNG format and RGBA mode, where it attempts to convert the image to RGB and discards the transparency information. This causes the tests to fail when comparing the resulting image colors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of discarding the transparency information, we should create a new RGBA image with a white background and then convert it to RGB. This will preserve the color information and correctly handle the transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, preserving transparency and producing the correct RGB conversion. This should resolve the failing tests.
