The buggy function has several issues: 

1. It tries to check and manipulate the format and mode of the image, but it does not handle the case where the format is not 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA' as required.
2. The function does not return the correct values according to the expected cases.

To fix these issues, we need to:
- Add a conditional block to handle cases where the format is not 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA'.
- Return the correct values according to the expected cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes the necessary conditional block to handle cases where the image format is not 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA'. It also returns the correct values according to the expected cases. Now the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
