The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode and JPG format correctly, nor does it handle images that are not in RGB mode. Additionally, the function should be returning the buffer containing the image data, not the image itself. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling different image modes and formats, and it is not returning the buffer as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the different image modes and formats, and return the buffer containing the image data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the beginning of the buffer
    return buf
```

In this corrected version, we check for both 'RGBA' and 'P' (paletted) modes for PNG images, and we create an RGB background for those cases. We then return the buffer containing the image data after saving the image in JPEG format. We also ensure to move the pointer to the beginning of the buffer before returning it.
