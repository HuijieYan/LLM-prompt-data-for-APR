The buggy function has a few potential error locations. The first potential error is in the conditional statement checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA.' The second potential error is in the conversion of the image to 'RGB' if the mode is not 'RGB.' The third potential error is in the use of the image.save() method with the 'JPEG' format.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement should be modified to handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA.' Additionally, the image.save() method should be used with the correct format, and the handling of the size parameter should be improved.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA.' Additionally, the image.save() method should be used with the correct format. The handling of the size parameter should also be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```
