## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Initialize background with 'RGB' mode
        background.paste(image, (0,0), mask=image)  # Paste the image onto the background with a mask
        image = background  # Assign the modified background to the image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to 'RGB' mode if it's not already in 'RGB'

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Specify the format parameter as 'JPEG'
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

## Explanation of Bug and Fix
The original function has several bugs. 
1. When converting the image from 'RGBA' to 'RGB', the `paste` method was called incorrectly, and the new background was initialized with 'RGBA' instead of 'RGB'. 
2. The format parameter in the `image.save` method is not specified, which may cause unexpected behavior when saving the image to the buffer.

To fix the bug, the following changes were made:
1. When converting from 'RGBA' to 'RGB', the background is initialized with 'RGB' mode, and the `paste` method is called with the appropriate arguments.
2. When saving the image to the buffer, the format parameter is explicitly specified as 'JPEG' to ensure the correct output format.

By making these changes, the function should now work correctly without the previous bugs.
