The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the conversion of images with an alpha channel properly. When an image has an alpha channel, it needs to be converted to an RGB mode explicitly, and the transparency needs to be taken into account when creating the background.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a white background with alpha channel to preserve transparency
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Use the alpha channel from the original image
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function properly handles images with an alpha channel, ensuring that the transparency is preserved when converting to RGB mode. The corrected function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
