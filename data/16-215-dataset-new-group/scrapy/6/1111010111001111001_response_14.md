The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. It should paste the image onto a new RGBA background before converting it to an RGB image. However, it is directly converting the image to RGB, which discards the alpha channel without preserving transparency.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to create a new RGBA background, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB. Additionally, we will handle the case where the image mode is 'P' and convert it to RGB as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that PNG images with RGBA mode are handled correctly by pasting them onto a new RGBA background before converting them to RGB. It also handles the case where the image mode is 'P' and converts it to RGB.

With this fix, the failing test cases should now pass, and the function should behave as expected.
