The bug in the `convert_image` function is caused by an incorrect check for PNG images with RGBA mode. When encountering a PNG image with RGBA mode, the buggy function wrongly converts it to RGB mode without considering the alpha channel's influence on the color. This leads to a change in color, resulting in a failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for PNG images with RGBA mode and correctly handle the transparency. We can use the `split()` method to separate the image into individual bands and use the alpha band to create a composite image in RGB mode. Then, we can paste the composite image onto a white background to preserve the transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Separate the RGBA image into individual bands
        r, g, b, a = image.split()

        # Create a composite image using the RGB bands and the alpha band as a mask
        image = Image.merge("RGB", (r, g, b))
        image = image.convert('RGB')

        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        
        # Composite the RGB image onto the white background using the alpha band as a mask
        image = Image.composite(image, background, a)

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
