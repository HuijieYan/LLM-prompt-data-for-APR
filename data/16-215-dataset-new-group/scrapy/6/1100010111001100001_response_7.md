The buggy function `convert_image` is currently failing the test cases for converting images. The issue is that it is not correctly handling the cases where the input image is in 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode. 

The first issue is with the conditional check for PNG and RGBA mode. The if statement checks for `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, but it should be the other way around, checking for PNG and RGBA mode first before considering other formats and modes.

Additionally, when converting a RGBA mode image to RGB, the alpha channel needs to be taken into account, and the transparency should be handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements for PNG and RGBA mode, and then handle the conversion from RGBA to RGB format correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format, and handle the transparency correctly, passing all the failing test cases.
