The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. If this condition is true, it creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to 'RGB'. However, the bug is that the 'RGBA' image is not being correctly pasted onto the 'RGB' background.

The bug is causing the failing test case to fail with incorrect image modes and sizes. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `paste` method is used correctly to paste the original image onto the background.

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the fixed version, we are now correctly pasting the original image onto the background by specifying the position to paste the image. We are also handling the case where the image mode is not 'RGB' or 'RGBA' by converting it to 'RGB' in those cases.

This fixed version should now pass the failing tests.
