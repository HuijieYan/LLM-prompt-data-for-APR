The potential error in the buggy function is that the image format and mode are being checked only once at the beginning, and then the conversion is made without considering the original format and mode of the image.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the different formats and modes of the images correctly, resulting in incorrect conversions and failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check the format and mode of the image before making any conversions and apply the appropriate conversion methods based on the original format and mode of the image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'P':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we added an additional check for PNG images with mode 'P'. If the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'P', it will go through the same conversion process as PNG with RGBA, resulting in the correct behavior for the failing test cases.
