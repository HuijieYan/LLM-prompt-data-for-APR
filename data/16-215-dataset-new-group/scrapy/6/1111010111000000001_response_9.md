The bug is in the `convert_image` function, particularly in the condition where the image format is PNG and image mode is RGBA. The bug occurs because when the image mode is RGB, the `paste` function takes two arguments, but only one is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `paste` call to include the correct parameters, and also handle the case where the image is in mode 'P' as indicated by the failing test. We should also ensure that the image is always converted to 'RGB' before generating the thumbnail, and that the thumbnail maintains the image ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test.
