The buggy function has three potential error locations:
1. The check for PNG format and RGBA mode is not working as expected, as it does not appropriately handle the transparency case.
2. The thumbnail size is not being preserved, as evidenced by a failing test case.
3. The mode is not being converted to RGB properly when the input is an RGBA image.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG format and RGBA mode images. The function is treating RGBA images as if they were RGB, which leads to incorrect color values when converting from RGBA to RGB. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which shows a difference in color values.

To fix the bug, the function should handle RGBA images differently and preserve transparency. Additionally, the function should correctly handle converting images to RGB mode and retaining the thumbnail size based on the provided input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():  # Check for PNG format and RGBA mode
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert RGBA to RGB while retaining transparency
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert non-RGB modes to RGB

    if size:
        thumbnail = image.copy()
        thumbnail.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = thumbnail
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected function properly handles PNG format and RGBA mode images, preserving their transparency during conversion to RGB. It also ensures that the thumbnail size is preserved based on the provided input.
