The bug occurs in the convert_image function of the ImagesPipeline class, where the image format is not being handled correctly. The failing test is expecting certain image format and mode conversions, which are not being applied properly in the buggy function.

In Case 1 and Case 2, the input image is expected to be converted to RGB mode and resized, but the buggy function is not converting the image format to RGB when the input image's format is PNG and mode is RGBA.

In Case 3, the input image is expected to have its mode converted to RGB, but the buggy code is only converting the image mode when it's not in RGB mode.

The fix for this bug is to properly handle the different image formats and modes according to the expected input/output values.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle different image formats and modes, resolving the failing test cases.
