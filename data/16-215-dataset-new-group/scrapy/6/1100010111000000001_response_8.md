The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely to be in the logic of handling PNG images with an RGBA mode and then converting them to RGB.

The cause of the bug is that when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function is creating a new background with a white color and pasting the input image onto it. However, the correct approach should be to create a new background with an alpha channel and paste the input image onto it to preserve the transparency.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling PNG images with an RGBA mode so that the transparency is preserved when converting to RGB.

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Creating a new RGBA background with alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Pasting the input image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode and convert them to RGB while preserving transparency. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
