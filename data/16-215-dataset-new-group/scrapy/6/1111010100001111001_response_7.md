In the provided buggy function `convert_image`, there are several potential error locations:

1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` may not be handling the conversion correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. 
2. The previous value of `image` is overwritten, which may lead to incorrect handling of the conversion process.
3. The `image.save` call at the end of the function always saves the image in 'JPEG' format, regardless of the original format, which can cause discrepancies between the input and output formats.


The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the image conversion based on format and mode. The image conversion logic should be adjusted to correctly convert images based on their original format and mode. Additionally, the function should handle the saving of the image with the correct format based on the original input.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:

1. Modify the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` to adequately handle the PNG and RGBA format.
2. Ensure that the original image is preserved during the conversion process to prevent unintended side effects and data loss.
3. Update the `image.save` call to save the image in its original format, rather than a hardcoded 'JPEG' format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    original_format = image.format
    original_mode = image.mode
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, original_format)
    return image, buf
```

With these modifications, the correct image format and mode will be preserved during the conversion process, ensuring that the function returns the expected image output based on the provided input.
