### Bug analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is failing to correctly convert images in certain cases. The failing test `test_convert_image` is checking whether the image conversion produces the expected output, but it is failing.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks on the image format and mode, as well as the image conversion steps.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks are not correctly handling images with transparency (RGBA) and are not properly converting them to RGB.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to handle images with transparency and properly convert them to RGB. Additionally, we need to ensure that the image conversion steps accurately convert the images to the required format.

### The corrected version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA'):
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we've modified the conditional check for PNG images to include both 'RGBA' and 'LA' modes. Additionally, we've changed the condition for image mode conversion to ensure that RGBA images are correctly converted to RGB. This should address the issues with image conversion in the failing test and fix the bug.
