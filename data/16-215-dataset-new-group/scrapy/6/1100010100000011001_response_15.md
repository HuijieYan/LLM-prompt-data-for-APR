The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues that need to be fixed. 

1. The first issue is with the `if` statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It creates a new background and pastes the original image onto it. Then, it converts the newly created image to 'RGB'. The bug here is that the original image is not modified, so the returned image will still be in the original format and mode, not in 'RGB' as expected.

2. The second issue is with the `elif` statement that checks if the image mode is not 'RGB', and then converts the image to 'RGB'. This may also result in the image not being modified, so the returned image could still be in a different mode.

To fix the issues, we need to ensure that the original image is properly modified in both cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        new_image = image

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return new_image, buf
```

This corrected version properly modifies the original image in the first `if` statement and ensures that the modified image is returned. It also creates a new image object for resizing if a size is specified.
