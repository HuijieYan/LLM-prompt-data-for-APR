From the failing test message and cases above, we can see that the bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the image conversion logic, as the expected output values do not match the actual output values.

The bug seems to be caused by the logic to handle PNG images with RGBA mode. When converting, it is not properly handling the transparency and not handling PNG images correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode by appropriately handling transparency during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new blank RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the white background
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the combined image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert other modes to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image to apply the thumbnail operation
        img_copy = image.copy()
        img_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        return img_copy

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version specifically corrects the handling of PNG images with an RGBA mode. It creates a new RGBA image with a white background and composites the original image onto the white background. Then, it converts the combined image to RGB. This updated process properly handles transparency during the conversion process.
