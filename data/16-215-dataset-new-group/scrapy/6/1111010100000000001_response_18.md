The potential error in the `convert_image` function is that it may fail to convert the image format to 'RGB' when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. This could lead to an incorrect conversion or error when saving the image as JPEG. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the image is properly converted to 'RGB' when its format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. We can do this by adding a check for this specific condition and converting the image format accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we modify the creation of the background image to use 'RGB' mode instead of 'RGBA' when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. Additionally, we remove the unnecessary `.convert('RGB')` after pasting the image onto the background.

These changes ensure that the image is properly converted and saved as JPEG without errors.
