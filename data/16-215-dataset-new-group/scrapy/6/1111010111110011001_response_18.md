Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The check for RGBA format and PNG mode might not be handling transparent images correctly.
2. There is a possible error in the image thumbnail generation logic.
3. The function might not handle cases where the image is already in the RGB mode correctly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of transparent images in RGBA format, and the erroneous conversion of images to RGB mode in certain cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition for checking the image format and mode to handle transparent images correctly.
2. Adjust the image thumbnail generation logic to ensure it maintains the aspect ratio and produces the correct size.
3. Check for cases where the image is already in RGB mode and handle those cases appropriately.

Updated and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        # Handle transparent images by creating a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Maintain the aspect ratio when creating the thumbnail
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should handle transparent images correctly, maintain the aspect ratio when creating thumbnails, and appropriately handle RGB images without unnecessary conversions.
