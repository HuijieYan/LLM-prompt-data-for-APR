The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly handles images with transparency. When the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is supposed to convert the transparent image to a non-transparent one. However, it seems to be pasting the original image onto a new background and then converting it to RGB. This approach is incorrect and is causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle images with transparency and ensure that the thumbnail generation keeps the image ratio intact. 

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Convert RGBA to RGB, keeping the original image non-transparent
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version should handle both transparent and non-transparent images correctly, and preserve the image ratio when generating thumbnails.
