The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of images. It appears that the implementation does not correctly handle the cases where the input image has a format of PNG and mode of RGBA.

In Case 1, the input image format is JPEG and mode is RGB. The expected return is an image with mode RGB but the actual return may include unintended transparency.

In Case 2, the input size is (10, 25) and the expected output is an image with size (10, 10). The actual output may not meet this expectation.

In Case 3, the input image has a format of PNG and mode of RGBA. The expected return is an image with mode RGB and background transparency handled properly, but the actual return does not handle transparency correctly.

In Case 4, the input image mode is P but the code seems to override it, converting it to RGBA and then to RGB.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the handling of PNG images with RGBA format to ensure that transparency is correctly handled during the image conversion process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Ensure image mode is RGBA
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By ensuring that the image mode is RGBA for PNG images, and handling the transparency with a white background before converting to RGB, we address the bug and ensure that transparency is correctly handled.
