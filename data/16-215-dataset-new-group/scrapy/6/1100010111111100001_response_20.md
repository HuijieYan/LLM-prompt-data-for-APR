The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely due to the logic for handling images with transparency (RGBA format) and converting them to RGB format. The failing test indicates that the converted image does not have the expected colors.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB. The code creates a new background image filled with white and pastes the original image onto it. However, this approach may not handle transparency correctly as it simply copies the alpha channel into the RGB format.

To fix the bug, we should use the `Image.alpha_composite` method to composite the original image onto a new white background, preserving the transparency if present. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case when the input image is in palette mode (P).

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should handle transparency and palette mode images correctly, and the failing test should pass.
