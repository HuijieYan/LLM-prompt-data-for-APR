The buggy function has several potential error locations. One issue is that when the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function attempts to paste the image onto a new RGBA background and then convert it to RGB. However, this code is incorrect because the pasted image should be in place and should not have a background. Another potential issue is with converting images to RGB when they are not already in RGB mode. This may result in loss of information from the original image.

The failing test case is `test_convert_image`. The error message indicates that there is a failure in comparing the color values of the converted images. In particular, the test fails at the assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`, where the expected value of `converted.getcolors()` is `[(10000, (205, 230, 255))]` but the actual value is `[(10000, (0, 127, 255))]`. This suggests that the conversion of the images is not happening correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion process handles transparency in PNG images and correctly converts images to the desired format without losing information.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with transparent mode
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    # Convert the image to RGB if it's not already in that mode
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    # Resize the image if size is provided
    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have made several changes:
- When the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, we create a new RGBA image with a transparent background and paste the input image onto it. Then, we assign the result back to the `image` variable. This ensures that the original image is pasted on a transparent background without losing transparency.
- We remove the unnecessary `background.convert('RGB')` line, as this conversion can result in loss of information.
- In the resizing step, we use the `resize` method instead of `thumbnail` to ensure that the image maintains aspect ratio and is resized to the desired size.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
