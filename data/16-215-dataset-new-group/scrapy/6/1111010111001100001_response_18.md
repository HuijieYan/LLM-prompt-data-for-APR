The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class of the `images.py` file needs to be fixed. The function takes an image and an optional size as input, and it modifies the image before saving it as a JPEG and returning it along with a buffer.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The conditional statement that checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA may not be functioning correctly.
2. The handling of the size parameter for creating a thumbnail might be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for converting the image from PNG/RGBA to RGB might not be working as expected, and the handling of the size parameter for creating a thumbnail may also be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for converting the image format should be updated to properly handle PNG and RGBA images. Additionally, the handling of the size parameter for creating a thumbnail should be modified to ensure that the image's aspect ratio is maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' when the image format is PNG. We have also simplified the handling of the size parameter for creating a thumbnail to maintain the image's aspect ratio. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
