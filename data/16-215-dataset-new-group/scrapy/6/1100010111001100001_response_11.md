The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' is not correct.
2. The conversion of the image to RGB format inside the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' condition does not handle the transparency correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the conditions for checking the image format and mode are not handling the transparency correctly. Additionally, the conversion to RGB format inside these conditions is not accurate, especially when dealing with transparent images.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to:
1. Update the condition for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' to handle transparency correctly.
2. Add a proper handling method for transparency when converting the image to RGB format.
3. Ensure that the thumbnail method keeps the image's ratio when resizing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Preserve aspect ratio
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
