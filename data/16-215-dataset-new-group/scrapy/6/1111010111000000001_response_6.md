The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements and the thumbnail size calculation. The conditional statement checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', and then converts the image to 'RGB' by creating a new background and pasting the original image onto it. The bug occurs when handling the transparency of the PNG image, as the background is set to white, resulting in a loss of transparency.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle transparency correctly when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, resulting in a loss of transparency.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the conditional statement to handle transparency in the PNG image correctly. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the background should be set to transparent instead of white.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the background is set to transparent, and the original image is pasted onto it. This preserves the transparency of the PNG image when converting it to RGB.
