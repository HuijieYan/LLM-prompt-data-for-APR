The bug in the `convert_image` function is that when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, it attempts to convert the image to RGB by creating a new background and pasting the original image onto it. However, this process loses the transparency information and results in the loss of the alpha channel, which causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the mode is RGBA and preserve the transparency channel while converting to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Preserve transparency while converting to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB', background=Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255)))
        elif image.mode == 'P':
            # Preserve transparency while converting to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=256)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will preserve transparency for PNG images with RGBA mode and handle images with palette mode as well. This should ensure that the test passes without any errors.
