## The buggy code analysis
The `convert_image` function is meant to convert an image to a JPEG format and handle transparency cases. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the function is creating a new background image with a white background, but it fails to paste the original image onto the new background before conversion to RGB. This results in incorrect colors in the converted image.
2. In the case when the image has a mode other than RGB, the function directly converts it to RGB format without considering transparency, resulting in potential data loss.

Both issues stem from how the function handles images with transparency, and the failure of the failing tests indicates that the function is not correctly handling these cases, leading to incorrect color values.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle transparency when converting images. Specifically:
1. When dealing with PNG images with RGBA mode, the original image should be pasted onto a new background before converting to RGB to preserve the original colors.
2. For images with modes other than RGB, transparency should be considered when converting to RGB to avoid data loss, and the function should perform the conversion in a way that preserves the image's colors.

## The corrected version of the function
With the identified issues and strategy for fixing the bug, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function is provided below:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the new background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the pasted image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        # Convert other modes to RGB while considering transparency
        image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues by properly pasting the original image with transparency onto a new background for PNG images with RGBA mode, and considering transparency when converting images to RGB for other modes. This should make the function handle transparency cases correctly and produce the expected image colors.
