The buggy function has several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` might not be true for all PNG images in RGBA mode.
2. The `background.paste(image, image)` line might not be pasting the image correctly.
3. It is unclear if the image is being properly resized to the given `size` if provided.

One potential cause of the bug is that the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not being met for certain PNG images in RGBA mode, causing the code within that block not to execute. Additionally, the image resizing logic may not be working as intended.

To fix the bug, we should first verify that the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` accurately identifies PNG images in RGBA mode. Then, we should also ensure that the resizing logic is working correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we changed the `background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))` to `background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))` and `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to ensure the image is pasted correctly. We also added `buf.seek(0)` to ensure the buffer is reset to the beginning before returning it.
