## Analysis of the buggy function
The buggy function takes an image as input and performs some operations on it, such as converting the format, resizing, and saving the image to a buffer. The function seems to have issues with the image format conversion, as well as the resizing and saving processes.

## Potential error locations
1. The condition for checking the image format and mode might not be correct.
2. The resizing process could be causing issues.
3. The saving process might have a problem.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function is likely due to incorrect conditional checks for image format and mode, as well as potential issues with the resizing and saving processes. This could result in incorrect image format conversion, incorrect image resizing, or errors in saving the image to the buffer.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Correct the conditional checks for image format and mode.
2. Ensure that the resizing process is done correctly.
3. Verify that the saving process is functioning properly.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the `paste` method is used with correct arguments and the `save` method specifies the format as a keyword argument. Additionally, the buffer is reset to the beginning before returning to ensure it starts at the beginning.
