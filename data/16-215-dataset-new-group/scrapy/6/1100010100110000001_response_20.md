The buggy function `convert_image` is attempting to convert images to RGB format and then convert them to JPEG, but it is not doing so correctly. The failing test indicates that the converted images are not being properly converted to RGB format.

The bug is likely occurring in the portion of the code where the image mode is being checked and converted. Specifically, the condition `elif image.mode != 'RGB':` is not handling the RGBA case properly, and the subsequent conversion process is not converting the image to the desired RGB format.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the RGBA case separately and ensure that the image is properly converted to RGB format when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we've made the following changes:
1. Changed the background to 'RGB' format when creating a new image in the RGBA case.
2. Modified the `paste` method to specify the position of the image.
3. Removed the unnecessary conversion step when the image mode is already 'RGB' after the initial check.
4. Removed the unnecessary conversion step after thumbnail generation, as the image mode should already be 'RGB'.
5. Returned the modified image and its corresponding buffer.
