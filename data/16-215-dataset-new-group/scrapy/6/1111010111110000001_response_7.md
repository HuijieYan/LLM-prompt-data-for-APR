The buggy function `convert_image` is provided as part of the `ImagesPipeline` class. It takes an image as an input and processes it, converting it to the appropriate format. However, there are a couple of issues with the function, which are leading to the failing test and error message.

First, the function does not handle the case where the image mode is 'P' correctly. If the input image has a mode of 'P', it does not modify the image, causing the mode to remain 'P' instead of converting to 'RGB'. This is the cause of the failing test, as the mode comparison is incorrect.

Also, in the code snippet:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The first `image` argument is intended to be an image, but it's being used as the bounding box for the second `image`. This is a mistake, and the correct approach should be replacing the second `image` with the tuple `(0, 0)` as the box.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function needs to be updated to correctly handle images with mode 'P' and fix the incorrect usage of the `paste` method. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Correct usage of paste method
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ('RGB', 'L'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Updated to handle 'P' mode as well

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these modifications, the `convert_image` function will correctly handle images with mode 'P' and fix the paste method usage, ensuring that the failing test will pass.
