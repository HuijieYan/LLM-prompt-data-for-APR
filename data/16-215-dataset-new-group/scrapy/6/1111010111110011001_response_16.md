The buggy function `convert_image` has multiple issues:
1. It checks for the image format and mode, but it does not handle the case when the image is in 'P' mode (Palette mode).
2. It incorrectly converts the image to JPEG format at the end of the function, despite the fact that the image may have started in a different format.

The failing test is specifically checking for the case when the input image is in 'P' mode (Palette mode). The error message indicates that the converted image colors are different from the expected colors.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Add a condition to handle the 'P' mode in the image and convert it to 'RGB' mode. 
2. Instead of hardcoding the output format as 'JPEG', the function should return the image and the BytesIO buffer, which can be handled by the caller as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':  # Add condition to handle the 'P' mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)  # Save using the original format
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
