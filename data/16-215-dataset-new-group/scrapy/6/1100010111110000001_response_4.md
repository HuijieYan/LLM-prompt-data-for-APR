The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle the transparency of RGBA images properly. It converts RGBA images to RGB, but it does not properly handle the transparency channel, leading to incorrect color values in the output image.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the transparency channel properly when converting from RGBA to RGB. We also need to ensure that the transparency information is preserved when converting the image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new background image with white color and the same size as the original image
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image over the white background, using the alpha channel to blend the images
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the composite image to RGB, preserving the alpha channel
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=256)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image with the original format and preserve the transparency
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we use `Image.alpha_composite` to blend the original image with a white background, preserving the transparency. We also use `Image.ADAPTIVE` and `colors=256` options when converting to an RGB image to preserve the quality of the image.

This version should properly handle transparency and produce the expected output, passing the failing test.
