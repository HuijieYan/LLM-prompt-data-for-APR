The bug in the function `convert_image` is likely due to a condition where it tries to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode and JPEG format, but it is not handling the transparency properly. As a result, the output image is not as expected, leading to a failing test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the transparency in PNG images correctly. We can use the `paste` method of the `Image` module to paste the input image onto a new RGBA image with a white background, and then convert the result to an RGB image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This updated version makes use of the `paste` method to handle the transparency in PNG images correctly. It pastes the input image onto a new RGBA image with a white background, and then converts the result to an RGB image, which should address the issue identified in the failing test.
