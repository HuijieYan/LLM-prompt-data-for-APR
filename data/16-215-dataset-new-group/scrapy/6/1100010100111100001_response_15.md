The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle images with transparency (alpha channels), leading to a wrong conversion to RGB mode for images with transparency. The error message indicates that the conversion of images with an alpha channel from RGBA to RGB is resulting in incorrect colors in the output.

The bug occurs in the section of the code where the function attempts to handle images with transparency:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles images with an alpha channel. When the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, it creates a new RGBA background filled with white color and then pastes the original RGBA image onto the new background. After that, it attempts to convert the image to RGB, but this conversion discards the alpha channel, resulting in loss of transparency and incorrect color representation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle images with an alpha channel correctly. Instead of converting directly to RGB, we should use the `paste` method to blend the image with a white background and then convert it to RGB, while preserving the alpha channel.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a white background with alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Blend the original image onto the white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the blended image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle images with transparency and the failing tests should pass.
