The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block which checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. It pastes the image onto a new background and converts it to 'RGB', but it should only perform this action if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. This is causing the incorrect output for the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block to properly handle the conversion based on the image format and mode. Additionally, when the `size` parameter is given, we need to handle the image thumbnail creation and return the correct output.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer cursor to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function addresses the conditional blocks to correctly handle the image format and mode. Additionally, it properly returns the image and buffer as required by the test cases.
