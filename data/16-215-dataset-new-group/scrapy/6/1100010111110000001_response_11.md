The buggy function `convert_image` seems to be failing when dealing with transparency and color channel conversions. The failing test case, specifically the assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`, indicates that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of images with transparency.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements for checking the image format and mode, as well as the image conversion operations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle image formats with transparency, especially when converting from RGBA to RGB. This results in the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles transparency when converting images and also correctly converts the color mode. This may involve updating the conditional statements and the image transformation steps within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
1. When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, we create a new RGB image as the background and paste the original image onto it. This allows us to remove the transparency and convert to RGB without losing the original image data.
2. If the image mode is not RGB, we directly convert it to RGB mode.
3. After image processing, we ensure the buffer position is reset to the beginning before returning the image and buffer.

These changes should address the issues related to incorrect handling of transparency and color mode conversions, allowing the function to pass the failing test.
