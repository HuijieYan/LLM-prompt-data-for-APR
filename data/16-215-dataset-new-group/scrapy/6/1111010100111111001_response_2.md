The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the conversion of PNG images with an alpha channel (RGBA) correctly. The function fails to handle the transparency of PNG images while converting them to JPEG format.

The `if` condition in the buggy function checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, but it does not account for the image having an alpha channel. This causes the function to incorrectly handle images with transparency.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle transparency when converting PNG images with an alpha channel to JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # Other methods and attributes of the class

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new white background image with the same size and mode as the original image
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            # Composite the original image onto the white background
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
            image = background
        else:
            # For non-PNG images, convert them to RGB if they are not already
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            # Resize the image if a size is provided
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we account for the alpha channel in PNG images by creating a new white background and compositing the original image onto it. This allows us to handle transparency correctly when converting PNG images to JPEG.
