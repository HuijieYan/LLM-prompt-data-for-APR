The bug in the `convert_image` function appears to be related to the conditions for converting the image formats and applying thumbnails. Based on the test case runtime and expected values, it seems that the function is not properly handling the conversion of images from RGBA to RGB, as well as the thumbnail resizing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly convert images from RGBA to RGB and handle thumbnail resizing when a size is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, resample=Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly converting RGBA images to RGB, and applying thumbnail resizing when a size is provided. It also updates the background creation and pasting process for RGBA images.
