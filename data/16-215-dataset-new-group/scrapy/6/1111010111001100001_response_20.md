The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of images with transparency. The function is expected to convert images to RGB and generate thumbnails if a size is specified, but it fails to do so correctly for images with transparency.

The bug can be fixed by properly handling images with transparency and converting them to RGB before generating the thumbnail. The following corrected version of the function addresses the issue:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the function, the failing test cases should now pass, as the function properly handles images with transparency and converts them to RGB before generating thumbnails.
