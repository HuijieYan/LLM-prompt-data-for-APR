The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing tests. The function doesn't handle images with the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode correctly, and it doesn't properly apply the thumbnail size to the image.

The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with an RGBA mode. When encountering such an image, the function incorrectly converts it to RGB without preserving the transparency, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and ensure that their transparency is preserved. Additionally, the function should correctly apply the thumbnail size for the image.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', converted.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(converted, (0, 0), converted)
        image = background
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and preserve their transparency, and also apply the thumbnail size to the image correctly. This should address the failing tests.
