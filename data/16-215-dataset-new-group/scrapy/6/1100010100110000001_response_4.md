The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing incorrect conversion of images, resulting in failing tests. The error message indicates that the lists differ for the expected and actual pixel values after image conversion.

The bug is likely in the conditional statement checking the image format and mode. When the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function incorrectly replaces transparency with white background, leading to incorrect colors in the final image.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for checking the image format and mode should be updated to handle transparency correctly. Additionally, the JPEG saving behavior should be modified to support transparency if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA' or (image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we remove the specific check for image format and handle transparency based on the image mode and additional transparency metadata. The saving format is also adjusted to use the original image format for saving. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
