The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. It incorrectly converts this type of image with a transparent background to RGB mode without retaining the transparency. This causes the failing tests to produce incorrect results.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the conditional statement to handle images with transparent backgrounds differently. This involves creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the failing tests should produce the expected results.
