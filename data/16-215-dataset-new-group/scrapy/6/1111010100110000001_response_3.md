The buggy function `convert_image` contains an issue with handling PNG images with RGBA mode, as the function mistakenly converts such images to RGB mode instead of handling them correctly.

The issue arises from the incorrect conditional check within the function. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function should create a new RGBA background and paste the original image onto it, before converting it to RGB mode. Instead, the function simply converts the input image to RGB mode in this case.

This problem is highlighted by the failing test case, which checks if the converted image mode and colors match the expected values. In the failing test, an image with PNG format and RGBA mode has been used, and the expected colors do not match with the actual converted image colors.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode should be revised to create a new RGBA background and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
With this corrected version, the function correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, ensuring that the resulting converted image matches the expected colors and modes in the failing test.
