The buggy function `convert_image` has potential error locations that need to be fixed. The first potential issue is that the image may not have the attribute `format`, leading to an AttributeError. The second issue is that the `paste` method may not accept the `image` parameter as the second argument. Additionally, the conversion of the image to RGB should be unconditional, not just if the mode is not RGB. Finally, the function always saves the image as JPEG format, even if the original format is different.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function to handle the potential errors and unconditionally convert the image to RGB. We can also add a condition to check the original image format and save it in the same format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if hasattr(image, 'format') and hasattr(image, 'mode'):
            if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
                background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
                background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
                image = background.convert('RGB')
            else:
                image = image.convert('RGB')
    
            if size:
                image = image.copy()
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
            buf = BytesIO()
            if hasattr(image, 'format') and image.format:
                image.save(buf, image.format)
            else:
                image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
                
            return image, buf
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid image format or mode")
```

In the corrected version, we use `hasattr` to check if the `format` and `mode` attributes exist before accessing them. We also modify the `paste` method to accept the correct arguments. Additionally, we unconditionally convert the image to RGB and save the image in its original format if available. Finally, we include a check for the existence of `format` before saving the image.

By making these changes, we ensure that the function is more robust and handles potential errors more gracefully.
