The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly converting images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') and PNG format to RGB format, which is leading to incorrect color values and the failure of the test.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') and PNG format in the function. When handling RGBA images with PNG format, the function replaces the transparent parts of the image with a white background, which is incorrect. Additionally, there is an issue with handling images in mode 'P' (palette) format, which also results in incorrect color values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle images with transparency and ensure that the color values are preserved during conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image to preserve transparency
        new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in its original format
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles images with transparency, preserves color values, and saves the images in their original format. This should fix the failing test and ensure that the function works as expected for images of different formats and modes.
