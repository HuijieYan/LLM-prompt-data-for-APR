The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of the image format and the usage of transparency. The error message indicates that the converted colors do not match the expected values in certain cases when dealing with transparency.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements inside the function, specifically the part where the image is checked for format and mode, and where the conversion and thumbnailing are performed.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of image transparency and format conversion which leads to incorrect color values in the converted images.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transparency and format conversion are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- The handling of RGBA images has been updated to correctly remove transparency and convert to RGB.
- Additionally, if the mode of the image is 'P' (palette), it is first converted to RGBA and then to RGB to avoid mishandling of transparency and format conversion.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test.
