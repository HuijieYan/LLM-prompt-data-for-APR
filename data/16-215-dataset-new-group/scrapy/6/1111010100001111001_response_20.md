The bug in the provided code is that the 'image' variable is being modified incorrectly when the 'format' and 'mode' conditions are met. Additionally, in Case 2, the 'size' input is not being used to resize the image to the specified dimensions.

The buggy function logic causes the image to be modified incorrectly when its format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It attempts to create a new image with a white background and then paste the original image onto it, then convert it to RGB. However, this logic is invalid and produces incorrect outputs. Furthermore, when the 'size' input is provided in Case 2, the function does not use it to resize the image.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the logic concerning the format and mode conditions, and properly utilize the 'size' input to resize the image according to the provided dimensions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
