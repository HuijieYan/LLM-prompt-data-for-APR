The cause of the bug in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' correctly. When these conditions are met, it tries to convert the image to 'RGB' without considering the transparency of the image, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to handle the transparency when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. We can use the `convert_alpha()` method provided by the PIL library to properly handle transparency and convert the image to 'RGB' format. Then, we can update the test_cases accordingly to ensure that the fixed function passes all the tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert_alpha()
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the transparency when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', ensuring the correct output.
