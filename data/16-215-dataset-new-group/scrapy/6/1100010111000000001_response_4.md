The potential error locations within the `convert_image` function are in the conditional statements that check the image format and mode. The buggy function seems to have issues with handling RGBA and PNG formats.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the RGBA format properly and does not convert it to RGB as intended, leading to failing tests for the RGBA and PNG cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the RGBA format by converting it to RGB as required.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now handle the RGBA format correctly by converting it to RGB when necessary. This should ensure that the failing test cases related to RGBA and PNG images pass.
