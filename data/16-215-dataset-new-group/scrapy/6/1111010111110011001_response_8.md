The bug in the given function `convert_image` is related to the conditions for converting images with different modes and formats. The main issues in the buggy function are as follows:
1. Incorrect condition for checking the image format and mode for PNG and RGBA images.
2. Incorrectly saving the image in JPEG format.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly convert images from RGBA mode to RGB mode when the format is PNG. This results in incorrect image color values and size, causing the failed test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, the following changes are suggested:
1. Modify the condition for checking the image format and mode to properly handle PNG and RGBA images.
2. Add a condition to save the image in its original format (PNG or JPEG) instead of always saving it in JPEG format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the convert_image function
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now work correctly and pass all the expected test cases.
