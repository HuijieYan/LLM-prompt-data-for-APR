The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert an image to a different format and resize it if necessary. However, there are a few potential errors in this function.

Errors:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not handle all possible image formats or modes correctly.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` may have an incorrect use of the paste function.
3. The line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` hardcodes the image format to JPEG, which may not be what is desired.

Cause of the bug:
The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not correctly check for the image format and mode. Additionally, the usage of the `paste()` method is incorrect and there is a hardcoded image format in the `image.save()` method.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the condition to handle all possible image formats and modes. We also need to fix the usage of the `paste()` method and make the image format in the `image.save()` method dynamic based on the input image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode not in ("L", "RGB"):
        image = image.convert("RGB")

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
    return image, buf
```
