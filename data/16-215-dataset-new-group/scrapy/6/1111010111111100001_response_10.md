The buggy function is the `convert_image` method in the `ImagesPipeline` class. The function is intended to convert an image to JPEG format, but it fails to handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly, leading to the failing test cases.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the converted image does not match the expected mode and color values. This suggests that the bug might be related to how the function handles images with different modes.

The function does not properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. The buggy code attempts to convert such images to RGB mode by creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it. This logic is faulty and leads to incorrect results when saving the image to JPEG format.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. It should check the mode of the input image and directly use the `Image.convert` method to achieve the desired RGB mode conversion.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
