The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that check the image format and mode, and the usage of the `paste` method.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is used to check if the image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. However, the format string comparison should consider case insensitivity, and the mode check should handle different mode combinations.

To fix the bug, we can use the `upper()` method to convert the image format to uppercase and check for equality with 'PNG', and update the conditional statements to handle different mode combinations. In addition, we should also use the `paste` method with the correct syntax.

Given the explanation above, here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
