The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to take an image and an optional size parameter, convert the image to RGB if it's not already in that format, resize the image if a size parameter is provided, and then save the image as a JPEG file. 

However, there are several issues with the function based on the input and output values:

#### Bugs:
1. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image onto the background, and then converts the result to RGB. After this conversion, the original formatting information is lost, and the result is no longer a PNG image.
2. When `size` is provided and the image needs to be resized, the function creates a copy of the image and resizes the copy. However, the original image is not updated with the resized copy.
3. In certain scenarios, the function incorrectly converts some images to RGB, even when the image is in a different mode, such as 'P' (8-bit pixels).

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Preserve the original image properties when necessary, rather than converting the format and losing information.
2. Update the original image with the resized copy.
3. Ensure that the image is only converted to 'RGB' when the mode is not 'RGB' or 'RGBA'.

Based on the analysis and the bugs identified, here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Calculate the new width and height based on the original image size
        new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode not in ('RGB', 'RGBA'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. When the original image is a PNG with RGBA mode, the pasting operation is performed on a new image (new_image) instead of updating the original image. This preserves the original image in its original format.
2. The check for converting to RGB now includes 'RGBA' mode as well, and ensures that images in modes other than 'RGB' or 'RGBA' are converted to 'RGB'.
3. If the `size` parameter is provided, the original image is directly resized using the `thumbnail` method, updating the original image with the resized version.

These corrections address the identified bugs and align the function's behavior with the intended functionality.
