The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly converts images with RGBA mode and PNG format to RGB mode and incorrectly handles the thumbnail image size. 

The bug causes the failing test to produce a different output than expected, leading to assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format, as well as correctly handle the thumbnail image size.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and handle different image types and sizes correctly.
