The buggy function `convert_image` is failing the test `test_convert_image` with the error message `Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]`. This suggests that the colors of the images are not being converted properly.

The potential error location within the buggy function could be where the conversion of images is happening, specifically the handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'.

The buggy function does not properly handle the conversion of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It incorrectly converts the image to an RGB mode without properly considering the transparency values. This results in the incorrect color values being returned for these images, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', ensuring that transparency is taken into account during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.load()  # required for transparency support
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, for images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', we first ensure that transparency is properly loaded using `image.load()`. Then, we create a new 'RGB' image as the background and paste the original image onto it using the alpha channel as a mask. This ensures that transparency is preserved during the conversion process.

With these modifications, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
