The buggy function `convert_image` is a method within the `ImagesPipeline` class that takes an image and an optional size parameter to convert the image into a JPEG format and return the converted image and its byte representation.

The potential error locations are:
1. The conditional statements for checking the image format and mode.
2. The conversion of the image to a different mode and format.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements may not be properly handling the image format and mode, which can lead to incorrect conversions.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the conditional statements to properly handle the image format and mode, and ensure that the image is converted to the desired format and mode.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and handle the image format and mode correctly.
