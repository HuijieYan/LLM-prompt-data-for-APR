The buggy function is called "convert_image". The function is designed to take an image as input and convert it to an RGB format, and optionally resize it to a specified size. The function then saves the converted image in JPEG format and returns the image and the saved buffer. The function seems to have issues converting images with transparency correctly.

The error message indicates that the function is failing when trying to convert an image with transparency from RGBA to RGB, and similar issues with converting an image from palette mode to RGB.

The potential error locations are identified to be within the conditionals that check for the image format and mode, as well as the background.paste() method and the image.save() method.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle images with transparency (RGBA) or palette mode (P) correctly. The function does not properly handle the conversion of these specific image modes to RGB, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, I suggest explicitly handling the conversion for RGBA and palette mode images separately. When the image has transparency (RGBA mode), we should create a new background with a white color and paste the original image onto the background before converting it to RGB. When the image is in palette mode (P), it should be converted to RGB directly. Additionally, we should handle the resize operation properly for these different image modes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly handles RGBA and palette mode images by creating a white background for RGBA images and pasting the original image onto it, and converting palette mode images directly to RGB. This fix should address the issues with image mode conversions and resizing, and the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
