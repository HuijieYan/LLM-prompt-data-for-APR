The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it is not correctly converting images with a format of PNG and mode of RGBA. This causes the failing test to produce a `Lists differ` error message, indicating that the expected and actual image colors are different.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode. Instead, it attempts to convert the image to RGB and then returns the unchanged image without properly handling the alpha channel.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))

        # Paste the original image onto the new background, using the alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)

        # Convert the image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        # Convert the image to RGB if it's not already in that mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This fixes the issue by correctly pasting the original image onto a new RGB background when the image is a PNG with an RGBA mode. This ensures that the alpha channel is properly handled and the image is converted to RGB as expected.

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass, and the expected input/output values for each case should be satisfied.
