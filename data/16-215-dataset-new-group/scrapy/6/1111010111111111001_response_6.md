The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG'. When the input image has these characteristics, it should be converted to a background of 'RGB' for further processing. However, the function does not correctly handle this transformation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement at the beginning of the function to correctly handle images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG'. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case when a specific size parameter is passed.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode not in ('L', 'RGB'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
