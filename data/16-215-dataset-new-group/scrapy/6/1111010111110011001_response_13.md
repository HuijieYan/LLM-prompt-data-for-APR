The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. When trying to convert them to RGB, it incorrectly generates a white background. This causes the failing test, which expects the converted image to have different colors.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by iterating through all pixels, setting the alpha channel to 255 (fully opaque), and converting the image to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_image = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        for x in range(image.size[0]):
            for y in range(image.size[1]):
                p = image.getpixel((x, y))
                new_image.putpixel((x, y), p[:-1] + (255,))
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input and output variable values.
