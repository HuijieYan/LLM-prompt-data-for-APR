### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class and is expected to convert images to the RGB mode and resize them if needed. The failing test is calling this function with different image formats and modes to verify its behavior.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the conversion of images, likely due to the incorrect handling of transparency/alpha channels in the images.

#### Error Locations
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is handling the RGBA mode for PNG images, but the subsequent code is problematic. 
2. The code that handles transparency case with palette seems to be incorrect, as it also results in an incorrect RGB mode.

#### Bug Cause
The code doesn't correctly handle the conversion of images with different modes and formats. It leads to incorrect image mode conversions, especially in cases where transparency or alpha channel is involved. This causes the failing test to produce incorrect results.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly handle the RGBA mode for PNG images to ensure proper handling of transparency.
2. Ensure that the conversion to RGB mode is carried out correctly for images with different modes.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the bug-fixed version:
1. The condition for PNG images with RGBA mode is corrected. Instead of converting to RGB immediately, a new RGB image is created and pasted with the existing image. This ensures that the alpha channel is handled properly.
2. When the image mode is not RGBA, it simply converts the image to RGB mode.
3. Other parts of the code remain largely unchanged.

This bug-fixed version should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
