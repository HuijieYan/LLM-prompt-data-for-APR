The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class fails the test case `test_convert_image`. The failing test case verifies that the `convert_image` function correctly converts images to RGB format and generates thumbnails with the correct size.

The potential error locations within the `convert_image` function are the conditional statements that handle the image format and mode. There are also issues with the conversion of the image and the thumbnail generation.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle RGBA images correctly, and the thumbnail generation does not maintain the image ratio.

To fix the bug, it is essential to update the conditional statements to handle RGBA images properly and ensure that thumbnail generation maintains the image ratio.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3]) 
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the code has been updated to handle RGBA images by creating a new RGB background before pasting the RGBA image and converting it to RGB. Additionally, the conversion of the image and thumbnail generation to maintain the image ratio has been addressed.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test case.
