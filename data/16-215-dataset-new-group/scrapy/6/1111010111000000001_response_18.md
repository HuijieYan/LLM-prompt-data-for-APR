The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues:

1. It incorrectly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, where it is converting the image to RGB mode but not properly handling the alpha channel.
2. It is not correctly pasting the image onto a new background when the image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode.
3. It always saves the image as JPEG format regardless of the original image format.

The test case "transparency case: RGBA and PNG" fails because the buggy function does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly by preserving the alpha channel, correctly pasting the image onto a new background, and saving the image in the original format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste image with alpha channel mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, preserves the original image format when saving, and should pass the failing test.
