The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. If this condition is true, a new background image is created, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to 'RGB'. However, the paste operation is incorrect and causes the alpha channel to be blended with the white background. This results in incorrect color values.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste operation by using the following strategy:
1. If the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image onto it without modifying the alpha channel.
2. Then convert the image to 'RGB'.
3. If the image mode is not 'RGB', convert the image to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create an RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using this corrected version, the `convert_image` function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
