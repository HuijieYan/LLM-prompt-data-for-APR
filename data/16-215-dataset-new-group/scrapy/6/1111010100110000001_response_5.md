The bug is caused by the incorrect conversion of an RGBA image with a PNG format. The convert_image function is not properly handling images with the PNG format and RGBA mode, leading to the failure of the test_convert_image unit test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode is correctly implemented in the convert_image function.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_image = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, "JPEG")
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

The changes include creating a new RGB image and pasting the RGBA image onto it, then following the rest of the logic as per the requirements. This corrected version of the convert_image function should pass the failing test.
