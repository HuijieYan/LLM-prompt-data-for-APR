The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function of the `ImagesPipeline` class. The problem is with the handling of images with different modes and formats.

In Case 1 and Case 2, the bug occurs when the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB'. Since the format is JPEG, the code unnecessarily converts the image to the RGB mode again, resulting in incorrect image mode and size at the function's return.

In Case 3, the bug occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The code creates a new background image with the RGB mode and pastes the original image on it, leading to an incorrect image mode and size at the function's return.

In Case 4, the bug occurs when the image mode is 'P'. The code unnecessarily converts the image to the RGB mode, leading to incorrect results at the function's return.

The fix for the bug would involve properly handling images with different modes and formats, and removing unnecessary mode conversions.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with different modes and formats, and pass the failing test.
