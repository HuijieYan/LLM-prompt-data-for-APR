To fix the buggy function, it appears that the main issue is with the handling of images with different modes and formats. The function should be modified to correctly handle these cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the buffer
        return image, buf
```

Explanation of changes:
1. When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the `Image.new()` function should use 'RGB' mode instead of 'RGBA', and the `paste()` function should accept the image to be pasted as the third argument.
2. The condition for checking if the image mode is not 'RGB' should simply convert the image to 'RGB', without the need for additional checks or conversion to 'RGBA'.
3. After saving the image to the buffer, the pointer is moved to the start of the buffer using `buf.seek(0)`.

By making these changes, the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values as described in the initial prompt.
