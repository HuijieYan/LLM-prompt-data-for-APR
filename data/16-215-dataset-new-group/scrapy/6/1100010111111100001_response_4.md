The issue in the original code is that when an image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode, the function is not correctly converting it to the desired RGB mode. Additionally, when the size parameter is provided, the function is not correctly resizing the image.

To fix this, we can update the function to handle the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB mode correctly. We also need to ensure that the image is resized according to the provided size parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Resize the image if size parameter is provided
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the failing test cases should now pass.
