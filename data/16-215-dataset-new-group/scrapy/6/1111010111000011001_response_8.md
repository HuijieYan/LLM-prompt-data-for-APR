The bug in the `convert_image` function is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function converts RGBA mode images to RGB mode by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it. Additionally, the function always converts the image mode to RGB, even if it's already in RGB mode. Finally, it saves the image in JPEG format, which may result in an incorrect image format.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle RGBA images correctly, preserve the image mode if it's already in RGB mode, and save the image in the correct format based on its original format.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function, we create a new RGB background for RGBA images and paste the original image onto it without using the `convert` method. If the image is already in RGB mode, we preserve the mode without converting it. Finally, we save the image in the original format by using `image.format` as the format argument for the `save` method.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
