The problem with the buggy function is that it is not handling the conversion of image format correctly. The function should convert images to RGB format if they are not already in that format, and it should also handle PNG images with RGBA format separately. These issues are causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle different image formats and modes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. If so, it creates a new RGBA image, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. If the image is not in RGB mode, it just converts it to RGB. Finally, it creates a buffer for the image and saves it in JPEG format, then returns the image and the buffer.
