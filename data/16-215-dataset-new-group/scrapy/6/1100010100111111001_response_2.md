The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing tests. The bug is related to the conversion of images to the JPEG format. The function is supposed to handle images of various formats (RGB, RGBA, and P), convert them to RGB if necessary, and then convert them to JPEG format. However, there are issues with handling RGBA and P images, resulting in incorrect outputs.

The bug is likely in the conditional statements that handle RGBA and P images. The conversion of RGBA images to RGB seems to be incorrect, as it results in incorrect colors. Additionally, the handling of P images also seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for RGBA and P images need to be adjusted to correctly handle the conversion to RGB before converting to JPEG. The conversion of RGBA images should take into account the alpha channel, and P images need to be handled separately. Additionally, the function should return the converted image along with the BytesIO buffer.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle RGBA and P images correctly, resulting in the expected outputs during the failing tests.
