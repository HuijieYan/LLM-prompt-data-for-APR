The bug in the provided function is that it tries to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode to a JPEG image without handling the transparency correctly. It also does not check if the input image is already in RGB mode before converting it to RGB.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check for the PNG format and RGBA mode, then handle the transparency by combining it with a white background. Additionally, we need to check if the image is already in RGB mode before converting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # You can specify the quality here (0-100)
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the start
    return image, buf
```

By adding the condition to handle PNG format with the RGBA mode and the conversion to a white background, and also checking the mode before converting, the function should now return the expected images and handle different image formats and modes correctly.
