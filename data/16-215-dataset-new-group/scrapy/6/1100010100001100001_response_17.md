The bug in the `convert_image` function stems from the incorrect handling of image format and mode conditions. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not correctly checking for the image format and mode.
2. The background image is not being properly pasted onto the original image.
3. Unnecessary conversion of the image when the mode is already 'RGB'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the different image format and mode conditions. It is also not effectively pasting the background image when converting from PNG to JPEG.

To fix the bug, we can create a new background image with the correct mode and size and then paste the original image onto it. We also need to handle the conversion to RGB correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
