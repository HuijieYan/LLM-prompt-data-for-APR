The buggy function has several issues:

1. The first `if` condition checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', but the subsequent code inside that block attempts to convert the image to RGB, which is incorrect.
2. When pasting the original image onto a new RGBA background, the `paste` method is used incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles images with PNG format and RGBA mode, and does not correctly maintain transparency information.

To fix the bug, the `if` condition should be modified to handle the RGBA mode correctly, and the `paste` method should be used properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
