The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a different format and size. However, it has a few issues, as evidenced by the failing test cases.

### Issues with the buggy function:

1. The first if condition in the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. If true, it creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image on top of it. Then, it converts the image to 'RGB' format. The issue here is that it should preserve the transparency of the original image.
   
2. The second if condition checks if the image mode is not 'RGB' and converts the image to 'RGB'. This may unintentionally remove the transparency from RGBA images.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of creating a new RGB image with a white background in the first condition, I will convert the image to 'RGB' format while preserving the transparency. 
   
2. I will remove the second condition that converts all non-RGB images to RGB, as this might unintentionally remove the transparency from RGBA images.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA') or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image = image.convert('RGB')
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function preserves the original image's transparency and correctly converts the image to RGB format, if needed.
