The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the input image is in palette format (mode='P'). When the image mode is 'P', the function should convert it to 'RGB' before making any further changes.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the image mode is 'P', and if it is, we should convert it to 'RGB' before performing other operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected version of the function, it will handle the case when the input image is in palette format ('P') and convert it to 'RGB' before processing the image. This should resolve the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input cases.
