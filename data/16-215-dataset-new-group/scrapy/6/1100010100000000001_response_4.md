## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to convert an image to the JPEG format and return the converted image along with the corresponding bytes object. However, there are potential error locations within the function:
1. In the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the comparison should be case insensitive because the format and mode could be in lowercase.
2. In the line `background.paste(image, image)`, the correct usage should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check for the image format and mode, as well as the incorrect usage of the `paste` method.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the condition for format and mode should be case insensitive, and the correct usage of the `paste` method should be applied.

## The corrected version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
