The buggy function has multiple issues. 

1. In the first if-elif block, when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, it creates a new background and then attempts to paste the image onto the background using `background.paste(image, image)`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should paste the image onto the background using `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. Additionally, the conversion of the image to RGB should happen after the if-elif blocks, not within them.

2. The second if block that checks for the size parameter is fine, as it just resizes the image while maintaining its aspect ratio.

3. The final issue is in the last line. The `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line should be corrected to save the image in JPEG format. 

The corrected version of the function is shown below:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# this is the corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # corrected pasting of the image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # corrected saving of the image in JPEG format
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test.
