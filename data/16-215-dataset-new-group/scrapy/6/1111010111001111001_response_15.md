The bug is likely in the conditional check for the image format and mode. It seems that the condition that checks for the PNG format and RGBA mode may not be working as intended. 

A potential fix for this would be to modify the conditional check for PNG and RGBA and perform the conversion as required by the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA') or (image.mode != 'RGB'):
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This version of the function checks for both the PNG format and RGBA mode or when the mode is not RGB and performs the conversion accordingly. It should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
