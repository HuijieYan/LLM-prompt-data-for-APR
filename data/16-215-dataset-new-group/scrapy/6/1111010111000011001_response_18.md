The bug is that the PNG format with the RGBA mode is not being handled correctly. The code only has the logic to handle the conversion of the RGBA mode to RGB, but it's not taking into account the actual transparency of the original image.

The fix would be to correctly handle the transparency when converting a PNG image with RGBA mode to an RGB image.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.load()  # needed for split()
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # 3 is the alpha channel
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and pass the failing tests.
