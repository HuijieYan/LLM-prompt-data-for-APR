The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly converts transparent PNG images to JPEG format without taking care of the transparency. This leads to the failing test case which expects the correct handling of PNG images with an alpha channel.

Judging from the failing test and the error message, it seems that the `convert_image` function should correctly handle PNG images with transparency and correctly convert them to RGB mode for JPEG saving. 

To fix this bug, the `convert_image` function should be updated to handle PNG images with transparency correctly, by ensuring that the alpha values are preserved during the conversion to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should handle PNG images with a transparent alpha channel correctly and convert them to RGB mode for saving as JPEG. This should ensure that the failing test case is now handled correctly.
