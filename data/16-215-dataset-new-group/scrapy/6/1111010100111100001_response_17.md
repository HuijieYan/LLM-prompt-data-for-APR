The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the conversion of images with transparency correctly. When the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the input image onto it, then converts the result to 'RGB'. However, this approach does not properly handle the transparency of the original image.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the transparency of the input image correctly, preserving any alpha channel information when converting the image. We can use the `convert` method to handle this transparent conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=255)
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version preserves the alpha channel information when converting images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', and converts the image to 'RGB' without losing the transparency.
