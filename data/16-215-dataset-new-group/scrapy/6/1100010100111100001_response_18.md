The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the tests to fail. The bug seems to be related to incorrect conversion of images with different formats or modes. The failure message indicates that the mode of the converted image is incorrect, leading to a different color being returned than expected.

The issue arises from the following parts of the function:
1. Conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB
2. Thumbnailing of images

To fix the bug, we can update the function to ensure that the alpha channel is properly handled when converting from RGBA to RGB, and that the aspect ratio is maintained when thumbnailing.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new transparent image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the background to RGB, removing the alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Calculate the thumbnail size while maintaining the aspect ratio
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues causing the failing tests. It handles the conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB properly and ensures that the aspect ratio is maintained when thumbnailing. After applying these changes, the failing tests should pass.
