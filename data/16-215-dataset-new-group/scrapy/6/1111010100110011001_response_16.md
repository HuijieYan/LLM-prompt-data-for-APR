### Updated Method
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """
    # this is the updated function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In this updated version of the `convert_image` method, I fixed the issue with handling images in RGBA mode. I created a new RGB background and pasted the original image on top of it. Then I converted the image to RGB mode. I also corrected the position of pasting the image onto the background, as it was causing the image to be overwritten. This should resolve the transparency issue and ensure correct processing of RGBA images.

Additionally, I replaced the direct comparison of image modes with a more general condition to handle non-RGB modes properly. This will make the function more robust and prevent potential issues with other image modes in the future.

These changes should address the bug and make the `convert_image` function work correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values.
