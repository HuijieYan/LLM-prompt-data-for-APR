To fix the bug in the provided code, we need to focus on the `convert_image` function. The error message suggests that the bug is causing a mismatch in the color values of the images being compared.

Looking at the `convert_image` function, the potential error locations are the image format and mode checks, as well as the conversion and resizing operations.

The cause of the bug is related to the image conversion logic. In the case where the original image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the color values are not being handled correctly, which results in a different set of color values for the converted image.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the image conversion logic to correctly handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, for images with PNG format and RGBA mode, we create a new background image with an alpha channel filled with white (255, 255, 255, 255) and then paste the original image onto the new background before converting it to RGB.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the transparency case with PNG format and RGBA mode correctly.
