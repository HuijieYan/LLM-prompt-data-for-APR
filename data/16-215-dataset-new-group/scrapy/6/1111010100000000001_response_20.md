The potential errors in the buggy function are:
1. The if condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' might not be triggered as expected.
2. The paste function may not be handling the image object correctly.
3. There is no error handling or exception catching for the image conversion and thumbnail generation processes.
4. The 'image.save' function is set to save the image as 'JPEG' format, regardless of the original image format.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't cover all possible image formats and modes, leading to potential errors in the image conversion and processing.

To fix the bug:
1. Use a try-except block to catch any potential errors during the image processing and handle them appropriately.
2. Check for all possible image formats and modes to ensure the conversion and thumbnail generation processes are accurate.
3. Modify the 'image.save' function to save the image in its original format instead of forcing it to be 'JPEG'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    try:
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, log the error, and return None
        print(f"Error occurred during image processing: {e}")
        return None, None
```
