The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to either RGB mode or to a specified size. The error message indicates that the color values of the converted image are not as expected, leading to a failing test.

The potential error locations within the function could be the conditional statements and the mode conversion logic.

The cause of the bug is that the color conversion logic is not working as expected. In particular, when the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is met, the background is created with the wrong size, leading to incorrect color channels and values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the image is correctly converted based on its format and mode. Additionally, when converting to RGB mode, we need to handle transparency properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the conditional statements ensure that the image format and color channels are handled properly, and the transparency issue for images with a palette is also addressed. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
