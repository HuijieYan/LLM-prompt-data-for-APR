## The buggy function and corresponding error

The function `convert_image` is failing for a particular test case where it's expected to handle the conversion of an RGBA image with alpha transparency to an RGB image. The error message indicates that the actual and expected color values are different, specifically in the alpha channel.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The conditional statement for PNG and RGBA images may not be handling the transparency correctly.
2. There might be an issue with the way the RGBA image is being converted to RGB.

## Cause of the bug and strategy for fixing it
The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the conversion of images with transparency correctly. The RGBA to RGB conversion is not preserving the alpha channel, thus resulting in incorrect color values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the alpha channel is properly handled when converting an RGBA image to RGB. This can be done using the `alpha_composite` function to blend the RGBA image over a white background, thus preserving the transparency.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create white background with alpha
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Blend the RGBA image over the white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the blended image to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we handle the RGBA to RGB conversion by blending the RGBA image with a white background using the `alpha_composite` function, which preserves the transparency. This should solve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
