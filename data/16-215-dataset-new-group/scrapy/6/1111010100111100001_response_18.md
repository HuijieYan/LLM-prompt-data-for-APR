To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function by addressing the transparency issue and making sure the image format is correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA'):
        background = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert("RGB")

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, "JPEG")
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles cases where the input image has transparency (e.g., RGBA or LA modes) by creating a new RGB image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. It also converts the image to RGB mode when it's not in that mode.

Now, executing the failing tests should pass without errors.
