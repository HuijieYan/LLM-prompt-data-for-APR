The bug in the convert_image function is related to the condition that checks if the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. When this condition is met, the function creates a new image with a white background and then pastes the original image onto it. However, the paste method should take a tuple (x, y) as the image position, and this is not passed correctly, causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the background.paste(image, image) line to provide the correct position for the image paste. Then, we should also remove the unnecessary call to image.copy() and update the return statement to include the correct return values.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
