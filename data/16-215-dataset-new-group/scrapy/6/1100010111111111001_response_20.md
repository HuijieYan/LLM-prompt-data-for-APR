The issue occurs in the 'convert_image' function where it incorrectly handles PNG images with an RGBA mode, leading to the conversion to RGB and a mismatch with the expected output. This is evident from the failing test, which checks if an image's colors match the expected values but fails due to incorrect handling of transparency.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of images with transparency. The function incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB, losing the alpha channel information, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle RGBA images differently to preserve their transparency. Specifically, it should convert RGBA images to RGB while preserving the alpha channel information.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve the transparency by creating a new image with an RGB mode and alpha channel
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The correction involves creating a new RGBA image as a background, pasting the original RGBA image onto it, and then converting the combined image to RGB. This preserves the transparency in the resulting RGB image.

With this correction, the 'convert_image' function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
