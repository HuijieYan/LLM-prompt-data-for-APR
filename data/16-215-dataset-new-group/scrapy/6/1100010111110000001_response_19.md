The issue with the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of images to a specific mode and handling transparent images. 

The first part of the function handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to JPEG format with RGB mode. However, when converting an image with a palette mode (P), it does not account for transparent pixels, which causes the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle transparent images when converting them to RGB mode. This can be achieved by creating a new function, `handle_transparent_pixels`, to handle the transparency of the image when converting it to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    def handle_transparent_pixels(image):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            return background
        else:
            return image

    image = handle_transparent_pixels(image)

    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this update, the `convert_image` function now includes the `handle_transparent_pixels` function, which specifically handles transparency when converting images to RGB mode.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
