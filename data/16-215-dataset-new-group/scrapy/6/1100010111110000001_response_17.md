The function `convert_image` is failing with the given test because it does not properly convert images of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. When running the failing test, the assertion error message reads as follows:

```
Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]
```

This error indicates that the expected result of converting the image from PNG RGBA to RGB does not match the actual result.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conditional block for converting images of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It seems that the conversion process is not handling the transparency correctly and is messing with the color channels.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to handle the transparency in PNG RGBA images more gracefully. One way to do this would be to separate the alpha channel before converting the image and then add a solid background to fill in the transparency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Only paste the RGB part, using the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, when image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', a solid white background is created and then the RGB channels of the original image are pasted onto the solid background using the alpha channel as a mask. This retains the original colors while removing transparency. Then the process proceeds as before.

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test.
