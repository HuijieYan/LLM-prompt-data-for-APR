The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements for checking the image format and mode, and in the subsequent modification of the image. 

In Case 1 and Case 2, the input image is already in RGB mode and doesn't need to be converted. In Case 3, the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, and it should be converted to RGB mode. The bug is that the code converts the image even if it's already in the correct mode.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove unnecessary type conversion and only perform the necessary changes on the input image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the unnecessary mode conversion for the PNG image is removed, and the thumbnail generation logic remains unchanged. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
