The bug behavior is caused by the convert_image function in the ImagesPipeline class. The function is supposed to take an image and an optional size, make sure it's in the RGB mode, resize it if necessary, and then save it as a JPEG image. However, the bug occurs because the function improperly handles PNG images with RGBA mode. 

Specifically, when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode without considering the alpha channel. Additionally, the function fails to handle the case where the input image is already in RGB mode. Furthermore, the function doesn't correctly handle the size parameter for resizing the image. 

To fix the bug, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Check if the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. If so, convert it to RGB mode while preserving the alpha channel.
2. Check if the input image is in mode other than RGB and properly convert it to RGB mode.
3. Apply the size parameter for resizing the image correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 
In this corrected version, we properly handle the RGBA mode for PNG images, explicitly control the pasting of the alpha channel, and correctly handle the conversion to RGB mode for other image formats. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected for the specified cases.
