The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues that have been identified based on the test cases failing. The main issues are related to the conversion of images with a specific format and mode, as well as the thumbnail resizing. Here are the identified issues and suggested fixes:

1. The function incorrectly checks for the format and mode of the image. It should be using uppercase for comparison to ensure consistency. Fix: Convert the format and mode to uppercase before comparison.

2. Resizing the image to a thumbnail is not correctly handled. The function should create a copy of the image before applying the thumbnail operation. Fix: Create a copy of the image before resizing it.

3. The function saves the image as JPEG format regardless of the input format. It should check the original format of the image and save it in the same format. Fix: Save the image with the original format.

Based on the identified issues and suggested fixes, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode.upper() != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

With these fixes, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test cases.
