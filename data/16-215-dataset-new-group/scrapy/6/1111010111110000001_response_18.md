The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting an image to a different format and size. It handles different cases based on the input image's format and mode. Based on the failing test, the error message indicates that the bug is related to the failing assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`.

Given the failing assertion, it's likely that the bug is related to incorrect color transformation during image conversion, possibly due to a flawed logic in the `convert_image` function.

The buggy function has the following potential error locations:
1. The conditional statements for handling different image formats and modes may be incorrect.
2. The logic for image transformation might be flawed, leading to incorrect colors in the resulting image.
3. The conversion to the 'JPEG' format and subsequent assertion based on colors might be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect conversions and transformations when handling different image formats and modes. The failing assertions indicate that the resulting images do not have the expected colors after conversion.

To fix the bug, the logic for image format and mode handling should be thoroughly checked and corrected. Additionally, the color transformation and format conversion should be reviewed to ensure that the resulting images have the correct colors and formats based on the input and the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the logic for image format and mode handling has been improved, with special consideration for PNG images with transparency. Additionally, the color transformation and format conversion have been reviewed to ensure the resulting images have the correct colors and format. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
