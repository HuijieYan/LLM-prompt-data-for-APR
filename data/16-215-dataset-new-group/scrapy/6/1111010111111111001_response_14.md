The bug in the `convert_image` function lies within the conditional statements, as the function fails to correctly handle images with RGBA mode and images that are already in RGB mode when resizing.

In the first conditional statement, the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image on top before converting it to RGB mode. However, the function incorrectly assumes that all images with the PNG format and the RGBA mode will require this conversion.

In the second conditional statement, the function only checks whether the image mode is not RGB, which is incorrect. It should check if the image mode is either RGBA or P (indicating a palette mode) and convert such images to RGB before resizing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle RGBA mode for PNG images and the palette mode as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function will correctly handle images in RGBA and palette modes, as well as ensuring that they are converted to RGB before resizing. This should fix the failing tests and ensure that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
