The buggy function has several potential error locations. One possible issue is the use of the 'paste' method with the incorrect arguments. Another potential problem is the use of the 'convert' method on the 'background' image and then returning 'image' instead of 'buf' after saving the image to the buffer.

The cause of the bug in the first case is the incorrect use of the 'paste' method with the 'image' argument.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly use the 'paste' method and ensure that the function returns the correct variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = new_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input and output values for the given test cases.
