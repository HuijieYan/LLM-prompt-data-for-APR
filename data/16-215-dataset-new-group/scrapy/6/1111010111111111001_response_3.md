The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the handling of PNG images with an RGBA mode. The function is intended to convert images to RGB mode and resize them if a size is specified. However, it fails to properly handle images with the PNG format and RGBA mode, resulting in incorrect image conversions and sizes.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function does not properly handle transparency in PNG images and convert them to RGB mode with the correct background. This leads to failing test cases and incorrect function behavior.

To fix the bug, the function must be updated to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. It should check for the image format and mode, create a new background image if needed, and then convert the image to RGB mode. Additionally, if a size is specified, the function should resize the image as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB mode
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert other image modes to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Resize the image if a size is specified
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image as JPEG format
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
