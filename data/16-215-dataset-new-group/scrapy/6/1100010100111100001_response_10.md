The buggy function is encountering issues when converting images with different modes and sizes. 

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` may not correctly handle images that are not exactly in the 'PNG' format or 'RGBA' mode.
2. The logic for resizing images with the `size` parameter may be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling images with different formats and modes, as well as resizing images while maintaining the correct aspect ratio.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to implement conditional logic that properly handles different image formats and modes, and ensure that resizing maintains the correct aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    new_image = image
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        new_image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        new_image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return new_image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should handle different image formats and modes, as well as properly resize images while maintaining the correct aspect ratio.
