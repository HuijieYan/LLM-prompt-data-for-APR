The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing test case to generate an error due to incorrect mode and color values. The bug occurs in the part of the code where the image mode is being changed and when the image is converted to a thumbnail.

The `convert_image` function is supposed to handle different types of images and convert them to a specified format, ensuring that the given size is maintained if specified. However, in its current state, the function fails to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, resulting in incorrect color values for the output image.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function needs to be modified to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and transparent elements.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version updates the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it. It also ensures that the alpha channel is properly handled during the conversion. The function will now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, as well as other types of images, and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
