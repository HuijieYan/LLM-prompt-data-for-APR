The bug in the given code is that when the input image is in PNG format and mode RGBA, the `convert_image` function is trying to convert it to JPEG format, causing an AttributeError as the input image is not compatible with the JPEG format.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when the input image is in PNG format and mode RGBA. In this case, we will simply create a new image with RGB mode, and return the converted image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have replaced the attempt to convert the RGBA image to JPEG format with creating a new image in RGB mode. We've also updated the `image.save` method to use PNG format, matching the input image format.

This should resolve the AttributeError and handle the input image in PNG format and mode RGBA correctly. Now the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
