The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of images with RGBA format and PNG images. The bug causes incorrect conversions for these types of images.

The bug is caused by the conditional logic inside the function. The first conditional block is meant to handle PNG images with RGBA mode, but it creates a new image with an incorrect background color. Additionally, the second conditional block is supposed to handle images that are not in RGB mode, but it is incorrectly converting images in other modes to RGB.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic inside the function needs to be modified to correctly handle RGBA and non-RGB images.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the first conditional block that handled PNG images with RGBA mode has been removed, as it was causing the incorrect conversion. The second conditional block has also been modified to correctly convert images that are not in RGB mode. Additionally, the import statement for BytesIO has been updated.

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test cases.
