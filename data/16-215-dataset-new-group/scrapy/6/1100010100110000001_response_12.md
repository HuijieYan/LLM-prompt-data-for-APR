After analyzing the buggy function and the corresponding error message, it seems that the issue lies within the conversion of the image to an RGB format. The failing test is failing because the expected `(10000, (205, 230, 255))` is not matching the actual output `(10000, (0, 127, 85))`, and this is causing the test to fail.

This indicates that the buggy function is not correctly handling the image mode and format conversions.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement that checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA does not accurately handle all possible transparency cases.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function properly handles images with transparency and converts them to the correct RGB format while correctly maintaining the transparency.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we handle images with transparency by checking if the 'transparency' key is present in the image info, and then appropriately converting it to RGBA and handling the conversion to RGB with transparency. This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
