The bug in the provided function is that the condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' is incorrectly written. The `paste` method should be used on the background image, passing the image as the second argument, instead of passing it as an argument to the `paste` function itself.

To fix the bug, the condition should be rewritten to properly create a new background image and paste the original image onto it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """




    # the fixed function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This fix should ensure that the function operates correctly for all the provided test cases.
