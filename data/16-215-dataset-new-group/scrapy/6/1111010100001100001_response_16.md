The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conversion of the input image to a different format and possibly resizing it. The function begins by checking the format of the input image and its mode. It then attempts to convert the image to a different mode and/or thumbnail size based on certain conditions.

The bug seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the image format conversion and size adjustments. In some cases, the function incorrectly converts the image even if it is not required, and in others, it may not correctly handle the image resizing.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the condition checks and the logic for converting the image format and resizing it based on the given size.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the fixed version, I removed the condition for checking image format, as it should always be converted to RGB before resizing and saving as JPEG. Additionally, I adjusted the order of image checking and processing to simplify the logic and ensure that the image is handled consistently.
