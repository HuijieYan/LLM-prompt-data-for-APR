The issue with the buggy function seems to be the image conversion logic, as well as the thumbnail resizing logic. The function is expected to take an input image and convert it to RGB mode, while also resizing it if a size is provided.

The bug in the current function is that it is not handling the RGBA mode correctly when converting to RGB. Additionally, it is not properly handling the size parameter for thumbnail resizing.

To fix the bug, we will need to modify the logic for converting RGBA images to RGB and correctly handle the thumbnail resizing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected function, it will correctly handle images in RGBA mode, and resize the images as expected. This should successfully pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
