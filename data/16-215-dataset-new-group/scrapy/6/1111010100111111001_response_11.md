The current `convert_image` function does have a bug in the logic. It incorrectly converts PNG with RGBA to RGB, and does not handle transparency correctly. This results in wrong color values in the converted images, leading to failing test cases.

The buggy class is an implementation of an abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle PNG images with transparency and convert them from RGBA to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new blank (white) RGBA image
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            # Paste the original image onto the blank image, using the alpha mask
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            # Convert the RGBA image to RGB
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            # Create a copy of the image
            thumb = image.copy()
            # Generate thumbnail maintaining aspect ratio
            thumb.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
            image = thumb
    
        # Save the image to a buffer
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes the correct handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, and it ensures that transparency is preserved during the conversion process. With this fix, the failing test cases should pass.
