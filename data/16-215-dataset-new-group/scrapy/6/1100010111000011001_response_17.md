The buggy function `convert_image` has several bugs, such as incorrect logic for converting images from PNG with RGBA mode to JPEG with RGB mode, and a problem with thumbnail size. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

Explanation:
1. Fixed RGBA to RGB conversion logic: We are creating a new RGB image with a white background and then pasting the RGBA image on top of it. Using `mask=image.split()[3]` extracts only the alpha channel from the original RGBA image and pastes the RGB channels along with the alpha channel onto the new RGB image.
2. Fixed RGBA thumbnail handling: Removed unnecessary copying of the image and directly applied the thumbnail operation, ensuring it maintains the aspect ratio.

The corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This corrected function should now work as expected and produce the desired output for the failing test cases.
