The reason for the bug is that the function is erroneously converting all images to JPEG format, regardless of their original format, which leads to incorrect output in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to respect the original format of the image and save it in the same format unless a specific size is specified, in which case we will convert and save it as JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    else:
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)

    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function now correctly preserves the original format of the image and only converts it to JPEG if a specific size is requested. This should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided and avoid the bug that was present in the original version of the function.
