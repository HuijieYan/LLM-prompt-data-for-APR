The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB format and then saves them as JPEG images. This results in the loss of transparency in the images. The failing test shows that the actual result does not match the expected result after the image is converted using the buggy `convert_image` function.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function to preserve the transparency of RGBA images when converting them. Additionally, we need to add proper handling for PNG and P formats to preserve transparency.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency for PNG images with RGBA mode
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert other formats to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Resize image if size is provided
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Save image in its original format
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function preserves the original format and transparency of the input image. It also handles resizing and converts other formats to RGB as before.

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
