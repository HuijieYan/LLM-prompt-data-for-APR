The buggy function `convert_image` is meant to convert images to the JPEG format and, if a size is specified, resize them. However, the function doesn't handle images with transparency correctly. The bug causes the function to lose the original transparency and color information of the input images.

The failing test `test_convert_image` checks if the resulting images after conversion and resizing have the correct mode and values. The error message indicates that the resulting image after conversion and resizing in the last test case does not have the expected color values, causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle transparent images correctly. When an image with transparency is converted to RGB, the transparency information and original colors might be lost. This results in incorrect colors in the converted images, causing the test to fail.

A strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring that the function preserves transparency and original colors when converting images with transparency. This can be achieved by using the `paste` method to blend the transparent image onto a new RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha channel for white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle transparent images and preserve their original colors, resolving the failing test.
