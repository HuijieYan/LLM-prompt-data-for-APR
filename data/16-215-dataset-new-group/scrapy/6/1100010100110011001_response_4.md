The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert, resize, and save images. The failing test is comparing the converted image with the expected output, but the actual output is not matching the expected value. 

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statements for image format and mode. There is a bug when handling PNG images with an RGBA mode, as well as with images that do not have an RGB mode.

The cause of the bug is that the image is not being handled correctly when it has an RGBA mode and is a PNG format. Additionally, the image is not being correctly converted when it has a mode other than RGB.

To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA mode images separately and ensure that the conversion to RGB mode is done correctly for both PNGs and non-RGB images.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, the failing test is expected to pass and the function should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
