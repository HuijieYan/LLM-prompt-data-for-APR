The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conditional statements and the handling of image mode and format. The test cases provided give us insight into the expected behavior of the function and help us identify the discrepancies in the function's actual behavior.

Based on the failing test cases, the bug causes discrepancies in the output image's mode, size, and colors. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles different image modes and formats correctly and that it preserves the specified size when generating thumbnails.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the conditional statements to ensure that the function correctly handles different image modes and formats. Additionally, we should ensure that the size parameter is correctly handled to preserve the image's aspect ratio when generating thumbnails.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Preserve aspect ratio when generating thumbnails
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the modified image to buffer
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

With these modifications, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle different image modes, formats, and thumbnail size preservation.
