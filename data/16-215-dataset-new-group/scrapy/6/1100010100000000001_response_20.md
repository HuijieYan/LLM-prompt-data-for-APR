## Analysis of the buggy function
The function `convert_image` is designed to take an image as input and convert it to the RGB mode if it is not already in that mode. It also allows the option to resize the image to a specified size and then save the image as a JPEG file.

## Potential error locations
The potential error locations in the function include:
1. Incorrect handling of the alpha channel in PNG images.
2. Incorrect use of the `paste` method for creating a background.
3. Inappropriate use of the `convert` method for converting the image to RGB.
4. Incorrect usage of the `Image.thumbnail` method for resizing the image.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images with an alpha channel and the improper resizing of the image using the `thumbnail` method.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the alpha channel in PNG images and properly resize the image using the `thumbnail` method.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()

    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info: 
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')

    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first convert the image to RGB mode if it is not already in that mode. Then, if a size is specified, we resize the image using the `thumbnail` method. Additionally, we check if the image format is PNG and it has a transparency channel, and then we handle the alpha channel properly before converting the image to RGB. Finally, we save the image as a JPEG file and return the image and the buffer.
