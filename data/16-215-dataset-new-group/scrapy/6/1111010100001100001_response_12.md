After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, the runtime input/output values, and the potential error locations, we can see that the bug is caused by the incorrect conditional logic for handling different image formats and modes. The buggy function is not checking for the correct image format and mode, leading to incorrect conversions and saving images.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic to correctly handle different image formats and modes.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the conditional statement to check for the correct image format and mode, and have also fixed the `paste` method call to correctly paste the RGBA image onto the new background.

This corrected version should now handle different image formats and modes correctly and produce the expected output for the given input parameters.
