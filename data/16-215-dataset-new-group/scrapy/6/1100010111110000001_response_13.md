The buggy function `convert_image` has a few potential error locations:

1. The condition `if size:` is not handled properly and may not resize the image as intended.
2. In the block where a new RGBA background is created, there is an issue in using `background.paste(image, image)`. This should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0))`.

The failing test is looking for specific color values after converting the image. The error message indicates that the converted color value does not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, the function `convert_image` needs to handle the size properly, and the pasting operation in the RGBA handling section needs to be fixed.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, the image resizing is correctly handled, and the pasting operation for the RGBA background is fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
