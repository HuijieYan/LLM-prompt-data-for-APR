The potential error locations in the buggy function are at the conditional statements where it checks for the image format and mode. It seems that the function is not handling the RGBA format properly, and it is not preserving transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the RGBA format correctly, and it is losing transparency when converting the image.

To fix the bug, the function should preserve transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB. This can be achieved by using the `paste` function with a mask parameter to ensure that the transparency is preserved during the conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle images with an RGBA format and preserve transparency when converting to RGB.
