The issue with the buggy code is that it fails to maintain transparency when converting images from PNG with RGBA mode to JPEG with RGB mode. Additionally, it fails to correctly handle images with a palette (P) mode when converting from PNG to JPEG.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `if` condition that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode to properly handle transparency. We also need to add a new condition to handle images with palette mode (P) when converting from PNG to JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the image as JPEG to BytesIO buffer
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=100)
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should handle transparency properly when converting images from PNG with RGBA mode to JPEG with RGB mode, and also handle images with palette mode (P) when converting from PNG to JPEG.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
