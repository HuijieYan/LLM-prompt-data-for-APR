The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements at the beginning. The first conditional (`if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`) checks for the PNG format and RGBA mode, and attempts to convert the image to RGB, but it overwrites the original image object which leads to incorrect processing in the subsequent steps.

The second if-statement (`elif image.mode != 'RGB':`) is also problematic because it attempts to convert non-RGB images to RGB without considering the original format, which may not always be correct.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the original image object is preserved and the conversion to RGB is done on a copy, and we should handle the conversion based on the image format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Preserve the original image
    img = image.copy()
    
    # Handle conversion based on image format
    if img.format == 'PNG' and img.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', img.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(img, (0, 0), img)
        img = background.convert('RGB')
    elif img.mode != 'RGB':
        img = img.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        img = img.copy()
        img.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Create BytesIO object for saving the image
    buf = BytesIO()
    img.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return img, buf
```

With these changes, we ensure that the original image is preserved and any necessary conversions are performed on a copy. This should fix the bug and have the `convert_image` function pass the failing test cases.
