The bug in the given function is caused by incorrect handling of the image format and mode. In particular, the function incorrectly handles the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode to JPEG images. The buggy function does not take into account that when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the background needs to be pasted before converting the image to RGB.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the background is pasted for PNG images with an RGBA mode before converting them to RGB.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will handle PNG images with an RGBA mode correctly, by pasting the background before converting the image to RGB, thus satisfying the expected input/output values for all cases provided.
