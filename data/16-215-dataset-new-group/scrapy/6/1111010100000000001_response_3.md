The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. This function takes an image as input, performs some operations on it, and returns the modified image along with a buffer containing the image data.

There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional check for PNG and RGBA format may not be handling all PNG images correctly.
2. The image conversion to RGB format may not be functioning as intended.
3. The thumbnail creation and image saving steps may not be handling image sizes correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format is not handling all cases of PNG images correctly, which may result in incorrect image conversion and saving.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format to handle all cases of PNG images correctly, ensure the image conversion to RGB format is done correctly, and handle thumbnail creation and image saving steps carefully.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=90)
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we check for the presence of transparency in the PNG image using the `info` attribute. If transparency is present, we convert the image to RGBA and then paste it onto a new RGB image with a white background. We also explicitly specify the format and quality parameters when saving the image to the buffer.
