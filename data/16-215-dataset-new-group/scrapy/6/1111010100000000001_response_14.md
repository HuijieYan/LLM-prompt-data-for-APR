The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class in the `scrapy/pipelines/images.py` file. It takes an image and an optional size parameter, and it is supposed to convert the image to RGB mode and resize it if a size is provided.

The potential error locations in this function include:
1. The conditional check for PNG and RGBA format may not be working as expected.
2. The image format conversion logic might not be correct.
3. The resizing logic may not be applying the size properly.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format might not be functioning correctly, leading to incorrect image format conversions and ineffective resizing.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional checks and the image conversion logic to ensure proper image format conversion and resizing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the conditional check for PNG and RGBA format to check for transparency in the image info. We have also modified the image format conversion logic accordingly. Additionally, we included `buf.seek(0)` to ensure the buffer is correctly positioned for reading.
