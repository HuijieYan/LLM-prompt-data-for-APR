The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional statements that check the image format and mode. The first conditional statement checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The second conditional statement checks if the mode is not 'RGB'.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling all possible image formats and modes, which may result in an incorrect conversion of the image.

To fix the bug, we should revise the conditional statements to handle all possible image formats and modes, and also ensure that the image is properly converted to the desired format and mode.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode in ("P", "RGBA"):
            image = image.convert("RGB")
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements have been revised to handle modes "P" and "RGBA" by converting the image to "RGB" for these modes. This ensures that the image is in the correct format and mode before resizing and saving it.
