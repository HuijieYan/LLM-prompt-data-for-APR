The issue in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle the RGBA mode correctly. When image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function is converting the image to RGB, but it is not preserving the alpha channel values while doing so, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that when the input image has format PNG and mode RGBA, it is being converted to RGB without preserving the alpha channel values, leading to incorrect colors in the resulting image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the convert_image function to correctly handle images with format PNG and mode RGBA. We should use the `paste` method to overlay the input image onto a new RGBA background to preserve the alpha channel values.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, preserving the alpha channel values while converting to RGB. This should fix the failing test as well.
