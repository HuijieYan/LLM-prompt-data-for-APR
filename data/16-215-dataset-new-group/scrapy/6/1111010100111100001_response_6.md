The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the image format and mode properly. This causes the images to be incorrectly converted, leading to failing test cases.

The bug occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The function incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode, resulting in a loss of the alpha channel and incorrect color representation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle images with the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. We can accomplish this by creating a new image with an RGB background to preserve the transparency, and then converting it to RGB mode.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
This corrected version of the function will preserve the alpha channel when converting 'PNG' images with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' mode, and it should pass the failing test cases.
