The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly converting images to RGB mode or resizing them when necessary.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert images to RGB mode if they aren't already, and to resize them if a size is specified. Also, the conditional statement for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect and should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
