The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the processing of images with different formats and modes. It is failing to properly convert images with transparency (PNG with RGBA mode) to JPEG.

The bug is likely in the condition that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode, as well as in the handling of the transparency when pasting the image onto a new background.

The cause of the bug is that when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts it to an RGB mode without considering the alpha channel. This causes the transparency information to be lost, leading to incorrect outputs when converting PNG with transparency to JPEG.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency is properly handled when converting images from PNG with RGBA mode to JPEG.

Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new transparent background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the image onto the new background with the alpha channel intact
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, it properly preserves the alpha channel when converting to RGB. This should fix the issue with handling transparent images and allow the function to produce the expected outputs for the failing tests.
