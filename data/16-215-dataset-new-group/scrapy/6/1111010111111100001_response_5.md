The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs because the function does not handle images in the "RGBA" format properly. When an image is in the "PNG" format and has an "RGBA" mode, the function is supposed to convert it to "RGB" and handle transparency correctly. However, the buggy implementation of the function does not correctly handle the alpha channel when pasting the image onto a new background.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle images in the "RGBA" format and ensure that transparency is preserved when converting to "RGB".

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected implementation, the `convert_image` function should now handle images in the "RGBA" format properly, preserving transparency when converting to "RGB", and passing the failing test.
