The issue with the buggy function is related to the background creation and pasting when the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA'.

The problem is that the new background image is created using the RGBA mode, resulting in a white background with some transparency. When pasting the original image onto this background, the transparency information is lost.

To fix this, we need to create the background image with the RGB mode and then paste the original image onto it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the background is created in RGB mode and the original image is pasted onto it without losing transparency information, resolving the issues with the failing test cases.
