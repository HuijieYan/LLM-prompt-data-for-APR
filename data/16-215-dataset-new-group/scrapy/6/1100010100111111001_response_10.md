The buggy function has multiple issues. It is not handling the different image formats and modes correctly, causing it to return incorrect values. 

The main issue is with the conditional checks at the beginning of the function to handle the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. The function should not convert 'RGBA' to 'RGB' directly; instead, it should handle transparency and alpha channels appropriately.

To resolve the issues:
1. Change the conditional checks and conversion logic to handle 'RGBA' mode and transparency correctly.
2. Check if the image has an alpha channel and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Check if the image has an alpha channel
        if 'A' in image.getbands():
            # Create a new transparent image with a white background
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            # Convert the image with an alpha channel to RGB
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            # If the image has no alpha channel, it can be converted directly to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should handle different image formats and modes correctly, and the failing test cases should pass.
