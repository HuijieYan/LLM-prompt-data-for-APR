The bug in the provided function `convert_image` occurs when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new image and pastes the input image onto it, then converts it to 'RGB'. However, the bug is that the 'paste' method is called incorrectly and should take a tuple (0,0) as the second argument instead of the input image itself.

The buggy function also converts non-RGB images to RGB, which is unnecessary and can be inefficient.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste method and remove the unnecessary conversion of non-RGB images.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected the paste method
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the updated function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should work correctly for the provided input values and cases.
