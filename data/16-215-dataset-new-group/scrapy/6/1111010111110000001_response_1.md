The problem with the function `convert_image` is that it is not handling PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. The failing test is checking for the colors of the converted image and is expecting a different result for RGBA mode images.

The issue is caused by the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, which converts the RGBA image to RGB, discarding the alpha channel.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `convert_image` function to handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly and maintain the alpha channel when converting the image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            if size:
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the `convert_image` function should now handle the PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, and the provided test should pass without any issues.

Note: Make sure to add appropriate error handling and edge cases as necessary, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
