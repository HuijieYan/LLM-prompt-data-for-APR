The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The function is responsible for converting an image to RGB mode and making a thumbnail if a size is provided. The error message indicates that the function behaves incorrectly when processing images with transparency (RGBA).

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the transparency of PNG images correctly. When the input image has a mode of 'RGBA' and the format of 'PNG', it creates a new image with a white background, pastes the input image on top of it, and then converts the image to 'RGB'. However, for images with transparency, this results in a loss of transparency and an incorrect conversion.

To fix this bug, we need to preserve the transparency channel when processing PNG images with a mode of 'RGBA'. We can achieve this by creating a new image with a mode of 'RGBA' and pasting the input image onto the new image with a white background before converting it to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles images with transparency, ensuring that the transparency is preserved when converting the image to 'RGB'. This corrected version should pass the failing test that was provided.
