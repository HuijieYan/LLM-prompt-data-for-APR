The bug in the `convert_image` function is that when the input `image` has a format of 'PNG' and mode of 'RGBA', it attempts to create a new RGBA background image and then convert it to RGB using the `paste` and `convert` methods of the `Image` class. However, the `paste` method expects a box argument, not an image, and the `convert` method should be called on the background image, not the original image.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- We check if the image mode is 'RGBA' instead of the image format being 'PNG', as the mode is directly related to the RGBA mode issue.
- When the mode is 'RGBA', we create a new RGB background image and paste the original image onto it using the `paste` method with appropriate arguments.
- We remove the unnecessary call to `convert('RGB')` after pasting the image.
- We use the `mode` property of the `image` object to access its mode, as it directly indicates the mode of image data.

With these changes, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly.
