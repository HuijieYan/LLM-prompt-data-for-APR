The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle the case where the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' properly. It also doesn't correctly handle the case where the input image mode is not 'RGB' but the format is not 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. We also need to add a separate condition to handle the case where the image mode is not 'RGB' and format is not 'PNG' and mode is not 'RGBA'.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles the cases where the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', as well as the cases where the input image mode is not 'RGB' but the format is not 'PNG' and the mode is not 'RGBA'. The corrected function should now satisfy all the given runtime and expected input/output values.
