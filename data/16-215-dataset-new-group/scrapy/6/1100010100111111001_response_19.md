The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling transparent images properly. It should convert transparent images to RGB rather than JPG.

Based on the specific scenarios provided, we should update the function convert_image to correctly handle transparent images by converting them to RGB format before further processing.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA') or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
By converting the transparent images to RGB format, we can make sure that the output of the function matches the expected values.
