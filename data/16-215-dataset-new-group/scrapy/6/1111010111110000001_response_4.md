The buggy function `convert_image` primarily aims to handle the conversion of images and resizing them accordingly. The error message suggests that there is a discrepancy in the color values of the images after conversion.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional statements for handling different image formats.
2. The resizing of the image if a size is provided.

The cause of the bug seems to be the mishandling of transparency and color values during image conversion, as indicated by the failing test and the error message.

To fix the bug, we need to handle transparency and color values appropriately during image conversion. We should ensure that the alpha channel is preserved when converting from RGBA to RGB, and the color values are maintained accurately during this conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # handle transparency and color values
        image.load()
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # paste with alpha channel
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we have included the `load()` method to ensure that the image is fully loaded, and we have used the `paste` method with the alpha channel to handle transparency and color values accurately during RGBA to RGB conversion.
