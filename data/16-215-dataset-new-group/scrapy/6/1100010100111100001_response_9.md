The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the failing tests. The bug appears to be related to the handling of images with transparency (mode='RGBA'). When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new background image, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. This process seems to be causing the incorrect color values.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the way the background is created and the original image is pasted onto it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly creating the background image and pasting the original image onto it using the alpha channel, we ensure that the transparency is preserved and the converted image has the correct colors.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
