The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to handle image conversion, resizing, and saving, but it seems to have issues with transparency, and converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode.

The error message indicates that the `convert_image` function is not correctly converting RGBA PNG images to RGB mode. The AssertionError is raised when comparing the converted image's colors. The failing test specifically states that it expects `[(10000, (205, 230, 255))]`, but received `[(10000, (0, 127, 255))]`.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the conditional block handling PNG images with RGBA mode, where it attempts to convert them to RGB mode. When handling transparency, it should create a new image with a white background followed by pasting the original image onto the new background.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode to correctly convert them to RGB mode while preserving transparent regions.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with the white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the new background
        background.paste(image, image)
        # Convert the image to RGB mode while preserving transparent regions
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that when handling PNG images with RGBA mode, we create a new image with a white background, paste the original image onto the new background, and then convert the image to RGB mode. This should address the transparency issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
