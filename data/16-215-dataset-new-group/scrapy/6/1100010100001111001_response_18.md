The buggy function has a few issues:
1. The condition to check 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode is incorrect, as it should be using 'image.format' and 'image.mode' instead of the hardcoded values.
2. The function is not handling the case where the image is already in the 'RGB' mode and the format is 'JPEG'. In this case, it should directly save the image without any further conversions.
3. The function is not returning the BytesIO object correctly. It should return the value of 'buf' instead of 'image, buf'.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking the image format and mode should be modified. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the image is already in the 'RGB' mode and the format is 'JPEG'. Finally, we need to return the 'buf' object instead of 'image, buf'.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.format != 'JPG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return buf
```
