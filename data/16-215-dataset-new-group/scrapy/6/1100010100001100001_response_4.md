The bug in the provided code is that the function does not handle the case where the input image format is 'JPEG' or if it is in 'RGB' mode and the conversion size is specified. 

The first issue is in the condition for checking if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. This condition is incorrect because it does not handle the cases where the format is 'JPEG' or the mode is 'RGB'. 

The second issue is that the function does not correctly handle the conversion size when it is specified.

To fix these issues, we need to update the conditions to handle 'JPEG' format and 'RGB' mode, and also correctly handle the conversion size.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format in ['PNG', 'JPEG'] and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, I updated the first condition to check for either 'PNG' or 'JPEG' format and the 'RGBA' mode. I also modified the `paste` function when creating the background image to include the position tuple. Additionally, I updated the condition to check if the mode is not 'RGB' rather than checking for any other mode. This ensures that any non-RGB mode images are converted to RGB. Finally, I added a check for the conversion size and applied it correctly.

These changes should fix the issues with the original function.
