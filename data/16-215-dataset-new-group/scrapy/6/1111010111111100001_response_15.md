The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of image formats. The function is expected to convert images to the RGB mode and create thumbnails if a size is specified. However, in some cases, the image format and mode are not being handled correctly, leading to the failing test.

The failing test is checking the result of converting an image with transparency from RGBA to RGB and getting the colors. The first test case is failing because the expected color is `(0, 127, 255)` but the actual color is `(205, 230, 255)`.

The issue seems to be with the handling of transparent images in PNG format where the mode is RGBA. There is a conditional block that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', but it does not handle transparent images correctly. Additionally, when converting the image to RGB, the background color should be specified to handle transparency, which is missing in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `convert_image` function to handle transparent images correctly and ensure that the background color is specified when converting from an image with alpha channel (RGBA) to an RGB image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        image = image.convert("RGB", background=Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255)))

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we use the `convert` method to convert the image to RGB format while specifying the background color for handling transparency. We also check if the image has an alpha channel using the `getbands` method to handle transparency in PNG images.

This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
