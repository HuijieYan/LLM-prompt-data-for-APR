The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly handles PNG images with an RGBA mode. When this condition is met, it creates a new image with an RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto it, then converts it to an RGB mode. However, the intention is to create a new image with an RGB mode as the background, paste the original image onto it, and return the resulting image. This can be achieved by creating a new RGB image with the same size as the original image, and then pasting the original image onto it.

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        converted = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        converted = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        converted = converted.copy()
        converted.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    converted.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return converted, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
