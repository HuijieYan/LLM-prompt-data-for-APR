The buggy function has an issue with converting the image to the desired format. It also has an issue with resizing the image to the specified size. 

The bug in the function is causing incorrect conversion and resizing of the images, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the image format and size properly. We can use conditional statements to check the image format and mode, and then convert the image and resize it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer to the start before returning
        return image, buf
```
