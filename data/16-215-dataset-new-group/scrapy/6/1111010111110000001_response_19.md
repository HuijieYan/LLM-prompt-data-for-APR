The cause of the bug is that the function `convert_image` does not correctly handle RGBA images with a transparent background. When converting RGBA images to RGB, the code does not correctly handle the alpha channel, resulting in incorrect pixel values and failing the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to correctly handle RGBA images with a transparent background, ensuring that the alpha channel is properly converted.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we handle RGBA images with a transparent background by creating a new RGB image with a white background and pasting the RGBA image onto it. This allows the transparent areas to be correctly converted to white without affecting the other pixel values. Additionally, we remove the unnecessary conversion of the image to RGB format since it's handled already when pasting onto the white background.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
