The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conditional statements and the handling of different image modes and formats. 

In Case 1 and Case 2, the function should not be modifying the image since it is already in the correct format and mode. However, in Case 3, when the input image has the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function mistakenly converts it to 'RGB' without considering the transparency.

In Case 4, when the input image has the mode 'P', it is mistakenly being converted to 'RGB' without considering the color palette.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and add a special case for images with transparency and palettes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Use a white background with alpha composite to maintain transparency
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        # Convert palette image to RGBA to maintain original colors
        image = image.convert('RGBA')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles images with transparency ('RGBA') by creating a white background and using alpha composite to maintain the original transparency. It also handles palette images ('P') by converting them to 'RGBA' to maintain the original colors.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
