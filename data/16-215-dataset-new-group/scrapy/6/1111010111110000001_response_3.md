The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is designed to handle different conversions and sizes of images before saving them. As per the test case `test_convert_image`, this function fails when the image mode is RGBA and format is PNG.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements related to converting the image mode and the format.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the RGBA mode of PNG format images. This is evident in the failing test case where the function produces different results than expected.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the RGBA mode for PNG images. This can be achieved by checking the image mode and format and applying the correct conversion steps accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Changes applied to support transparency in PNG format
        if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, I have added additional checks for the image mode to support transparency in PNG format. This will handle images with RGBA mode appropriately and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
