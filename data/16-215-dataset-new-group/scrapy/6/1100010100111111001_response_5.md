The buggy function is `convert_image`, which is supposed to convert an input image to the desired format and size. The function encounters problems when the input image has a transparency channel (alpha), and it is saved as a JPEG file. This results in incorrect image colors and sizes, failing the tests.

The bug is in the if condition that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function creates a new white background, pastes the input image onto it, and then converts it to RGB mode. The problem is that the input image is pasted onto the new background incorrectly, causing the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we can revise the code as follows:
1. Check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
2. If the conditions are met, convert the image to RGB mode without creating a new background and pasting the image onto it.

The revised version of the function is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
