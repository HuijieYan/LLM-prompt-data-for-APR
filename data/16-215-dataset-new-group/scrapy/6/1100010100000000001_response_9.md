The potential error in the given code is in the `convert_image` function. It checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' and then tries to convert the image to 'RGB'. However, the bug occurs when using the `paste` method of the `Image` class, and the correct way to use it is by specifying the box parameter, which is the location to paste the image.

The cause of the bug is that the `paste` method is used incorrectly, which leads to unexpected behavior when converting the image.

To fix the bug, the `paste` method should be used correctly, specifying the box parameter to paste the image at the correct position.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
In the corrected version, the `paste` method is used with the correct parameters, specifying the box as (0, 0) and the image to be pasted. This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
