The buggy function `convert_image` has the following potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` may not be evaluating properly.
2. In the line `background.paste(image, image)`, there may be an issue with how the image is being pasted onto the background.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly converting images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. This is evident from the failing test case where the converted image's mode and colors are not as expected.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` needs to be properly evaluated. Additionally, the pasting of the image onto the background needs to be corrected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test case provided.
