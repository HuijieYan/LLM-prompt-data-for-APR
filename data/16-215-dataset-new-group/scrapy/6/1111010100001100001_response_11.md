The bug in the `convert_image` function is likely due to incorrect condition checks and variable usage. From the provided runtime input/output values, it can be seen that the function is not correctly handling the image conversion and size parameters.

In the first case, the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB'. For this case, the function should return the unchanged image as the format and mode are already correct. However, the current implementation of the function might perform unnecessary operations on the image, leading to incorrect results.

In the second case, a size parameter is provided, and the function should resize the image to the specified size. However, the output of the function shows that the size of the image is different from the expected size, indicating a bug in the resizing logic.

In the third case, when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function should perform additional processing to convert the image to 'RGB' and handle transparency. While the image mode is correctly converted, the background paste operation seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

In the fourth case, the input image has a mode of 'P', and the function should correctly handle this mode and convert it to 'RGB' if needed. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly convert the image mode.

To fix the bug, the condition checks and image manipulation logic need to be revised. Additionally, the resizing logic should be reviewed to ensure it produces the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the image mode is 'P', and if so, it converts the image to 'RGB'. Then, it applies the size parameter for resizing the image if needed. Finally, it saves the image to a JPEG buffer and returns the image and the buffer.

This corrected version should address the issues observed in the buggy function and produce the expected results for the provided runtime input/output values.
