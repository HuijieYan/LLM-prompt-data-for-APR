The buggy function seems to have multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. The condition for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode is incorrect, as it does not handle transparency properly.
2. The thumbnail size is not being calculated correctly.
3. The function should return both the modified image and the buffer.

To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:

1. Modify the condition for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode by properly handling transparency.
2. Calculate the thumbnail size correctly by maintaining the aspect ratio.
3. Return both the modified image and the buffer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, maintains the aspect ratio for thumbnail images, and returns both the modified image and the buffer. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
