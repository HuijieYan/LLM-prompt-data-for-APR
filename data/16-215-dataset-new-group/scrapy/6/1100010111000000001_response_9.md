The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` does not handle cases where the format is PNG but the mode is not RGBA. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` does not correctly paste the image onto the background, and should be modified.
3. The function does not correctly handle the case where an image is already in RGB mode.

To fix these issues, here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. Changed `background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))` to `background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))` to match the mode of the background image and modified the paste line to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to correctly paste the image onto the background.
2. Removed the unnecessary `image = background.convert('RGB')` line and replaced it with just `image = background`.
3. Added `buf.seek(0)` before returning the buffer to reset the file pointer to the beginning.

These changes address the issues with the original function and should ensure that it passes the failing test.
