The issue with the buggy function is that it improperly handles the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode, and it doesn't correctly convert any image with a mode other than RGB to RGB before resizing. 

To fix the bug, we will modify the function to first check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If so, we will create a new RGBA image with a white background, paste the original image onto the new background, and then convert the new image to RGB. For any other mode, we will convert the image to RGB first before proceeding with any resizing. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode, as well as properly convert any type of input image to RGB before resizing.
