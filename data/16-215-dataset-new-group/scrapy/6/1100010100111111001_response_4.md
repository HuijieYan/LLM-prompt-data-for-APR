The issue in the `convert_image` function is that the check to convert the image to RGB format in case of a PNG with RGBA mode discards the alpha channel, which results in a different converted color compared to the original. This is why the failing tests are showing incorrect results for color comparisons.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to handle the RGBA mode correctly, preserving the alpha channel when converting the image to RGB format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
        if 'A' in image.getbands():
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the image mode is RGBA or P. If it is RGBA and contains an alpha channel ('A' in image.getbands()), we create a new RGBA background, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB. If it doesn't contain the alpha channel, we directly convert it to RGB. For other modes, we convert the image to RGB as before.

With this fix, the function should now pass all the failing tests and produce the expected output.
