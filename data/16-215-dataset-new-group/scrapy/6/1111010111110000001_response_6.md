The buggy function `convert_image` is causing the failing test. The function is supposed to convert an image to either RGB format or JPEG and perform additional operations based on the image's format and mode. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect and does not handle the image format and mode properly, resulting in the failing test.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling PNG format and RGBA mode. The function does not properly handle the RGBA mode for PNG images, leading to incorrect color transformation and failing the corresponding test.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling PNG format and RGBA mode needs to be updated to ensure correct color transformation and image conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the handling of PNG format and RGBA mode has been updated to create a new RGB background and paste the RGBA image onto it. Additionally, the unnecessary conversion of RGBA to RGB has been removed, ensuring that the color information is retained during the transformation.

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test.
