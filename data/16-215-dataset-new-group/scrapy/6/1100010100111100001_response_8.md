The bug in the provided function is causing the failing test due to incorrect image processing, specifically when handling PNG images with an RGBA mode. 

The bug is located in the if-elif block where it checks for the image format and mode. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it while attempting to convert to RGB. However, this process is incorrect and leads to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is that the code incorrectly assumes that pasting the original image onto a new RGBA background and converting to RGB will correctly handle the transparency of the original image. However, this is not the correct way to handle the transparency in PNG images with an RGBA mode.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the transparency of PNG images with an RGBA mode correctly. This can be done by using the `convert('RGB')` method as the default method for converting the image, and then applying the `thumbnail` method for resizing the image.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
