The issue in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle the case when the input image has transparency and is in the PNG format. This causes the failing test to produce incorrect results, specifically the `getcolors` method.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when the input image is in PNG format and has transparency (mode 'RGBA'). We should then create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image into it before converting it to RGB format. We also need to change the format from 'JPEG' to 'PNG' when saving the image.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create RGBA background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image into the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')  # Save as PNG
    return image, buf
```

With this change, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing tests.
