The provided buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to the JPEG format, handling different modes and transparent backgrounds. However, the function is failing the test case `test_convert_image` due to an issue with the `convert_image` function.

The potential error location within the buggy function is where the image is saved to the buffer using `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`. This line is currently hardcoded to save the image in JPEG format regardless of the original format, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function always saves the image in JPEG format, which does not align with the different image formats and modes expected in the test cases. This inconsistency results in the failing test and the corresponding error message, specifically when comparing the expected colors of the converted image.

To fix the bug, a strategy involving conditional handling of different image formats can be applied. The function should determine the original image format and handle each case accordingly, ensuring that the output format aligns with the expectations in the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Save image based on its original format
    if image.format:
        format = image.format
    else:
        format = 'JPEG'
        
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the image is saved using its original format if available, falling back to JPEG only if the original format is not available. This conditional handling ensures that the output format aligns with the original format of the image. With this correction, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test.
