The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The function incorrectly converts these images to RGB format, losing transparency. Additionally, when generating a thumbnail, the function does not preserve the aspect ratio of the image.

To correct this bug, the function needs to check if an image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode. If so, it should correctly handle transparency by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. Additionally, when generating thumbnails, it should preserve the aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA background with white color
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB preserving the alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image to avoid modifying the original
        img_copy = image.copy()
        img_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = img_copy

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image to the buffer in JPEG format
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the function should behave as expected for both JPEG and PNG images.
