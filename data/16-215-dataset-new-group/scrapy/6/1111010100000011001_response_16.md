## Analysis
The `convert_image` function is designed to take an input image and optionally a size, then convert it to a JPEG format and return the converted image and its corresponding buffer. It checks the format and mode of the input image, and makes any necessary conversions before resizing and converting to JPEG format. Based on the expected values and types of variables, the bug seems to be related to incorrectly identifying the image format and mode, as well as potential issues with resizing.

## Bug
1. The buggy function incorrectly identifies the format and mode of the input image, leading to incorrect conversions.
2. The function does not handle resizing the image correctly.

## Fix
1. Modify the function to correctly identify the format and mode of the input image.
2. Ensure that resizing the image is handled properly.


## The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format and image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
