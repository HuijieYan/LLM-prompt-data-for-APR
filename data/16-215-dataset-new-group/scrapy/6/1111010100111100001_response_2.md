The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of transparency in PNG images. The function is expected to convert images to RGB mode and create thumbnails. However, it fails to handle RGBA images properly.

The root cause of the bug is that when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function creates a new RGBA background image to paste the original image onto. Then it converts the image to RGB mode, effectively removing the alpha channel and potentially altering the colors.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to handle RGBA images differently. Instead of converting them to RGB immediately, we can create a new RGB image and paste the original image onto it without altering its colors.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # handling transparency in PNG images
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # create a new RGB image
        new_image = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # paste the original RGBA image onto the new RGB image
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should properly handle RGBA images when creating thumbnails and should pass the failing test.
