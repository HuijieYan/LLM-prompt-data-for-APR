The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The if condition to check the image format and mode may not be reliable.
2. The use of the 'background.paste(image, image)' is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling images with RGBA format, and the 'paste' method is not being used correctly.

To fix the bug, we can implement more robust checks for the image format and mode, and use the 'paste' method correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the format check with a mode check, and corrected the usage of the 'paste' method.
