The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to handling images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It appears that the conversion logic is not implemented correctly and is causing issues with image formats and mode conversions.

### Cause of the bug
1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function seems to incorrectly handle the conversion of images with the format 'JPEG' and mode 'RGB' as it performs unnecessary conversion and size manipulation.
2. In Case 3, when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function attempts to convert the image, but the logic seems to be incorrect, and the conversion result is not as expected.
3. In Case 4, when the image mode is 'P' (Palette mode), the conversion logic seems to produce incorrect results, as it initializes the image as type 'RGBA' instead of 'RGB'.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Refactor the conversion logic to correctly handle image format and mode conversions.
2. Ensure that the conditional checks for image format and mode are implemented accurately.
3. Verify that the final image format and mode are as expected before returning.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
