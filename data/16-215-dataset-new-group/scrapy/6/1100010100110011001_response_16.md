The buggy function contains several issues. First, the if condition for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' should be corrected with proper conditionals. Second, in the case of an RGBA image with a transparency layer, the alpha channel needs to be removed before pasting the image onto a new background. Third, the conversion of the image format to RGB is resulting in incorrect colors for images with transparency.

To fix the issues, the conditional checks in the function need to be corrected, and the handling of RGBA images needs to be adjusted. Additionally, it is better to use the `Image.alpha_composite` method to combine images with transparency rather than creating a new background.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB, discarding the alpha channel
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save as JPEG without alpha channel
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
