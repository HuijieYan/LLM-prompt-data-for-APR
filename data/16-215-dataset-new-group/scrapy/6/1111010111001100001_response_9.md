The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the function attempts to create a new image with a white background and then converts it to RGB. However, the mode should stay as RGBA to preserve the transparency. Additionally, in the last case, when the input mode is 'P', the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling PNG images in RGBA mode and ensure that the mode remains RGBA. Additionally, when the input mode is 'P', we should not convert the image to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the PNG image in RGBA mode by checking if the `size` parameter is provided and creating a thumbnail without converting the mode. Then, we handle the other cases by checking if the mode is not RGB and converting it if necessary. Finally, we save the image in JPEG format and return it. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
