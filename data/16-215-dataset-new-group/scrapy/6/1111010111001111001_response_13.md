The bug in the `convert_image` function relates to the logic for handling images with PNG format and RGBA mode, which fails to correctly convert the image to RGB. This results in incorrect color values and modes for the images returned by the function, leading to failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode correctly. It tries to handle them with the same logic as other images, resulting in incorrect color values and modes. Additionally, the function inappropriately converts images with mode different from RGB to RGB even though they may have other valid modes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling images with PNG format and RGBA mode. Specifically, we should properly handle transparency and convert such images to RGB to maintain color accuracy. Additionally, we should only convert images with modes other than RGB to RGB if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function handles images with PNG format and RGBA mode correctly by converting them to RGB to maintain color accuracy. It also avoids unnecessary conversions to RGB for images with modes other than RGB.
