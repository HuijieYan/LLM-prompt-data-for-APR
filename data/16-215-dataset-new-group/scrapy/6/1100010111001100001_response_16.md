The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode.

The bug is identified in the following line of the function:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The issue is that the `paste` function expects a box argument, which specifies the top-left corner of the specified box in the upper left corner of the current image. Instead, it is mistakenly taking `image` as the box argument, leading to unexpected behavior in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to provide the correct box argument for the `paste` function and handle RGBA images properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode appropriately and produce the expected output for the failing tests.
