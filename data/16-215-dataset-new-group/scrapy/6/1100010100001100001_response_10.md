The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues:

1. In the first `if` block, the condition checks for `image.format == 'PNG'` and `image.mode == 'RGBA'`, but the code in the block uses `image.paste(image, image)`, which doesn't make sense and is likely a typo.
2. The `else` block, which is supposed to handle cases where the image format is not PNG and its mode is not 'RGBA', still tries to convert the image to RGB, even if it's already in that mode.
3. The function doesn't handle the case where the actual input image format is already set to 'JPEG', but does some unnecessary processing regardless.

To fix the function:

- Modify the condition in the first `if` block to properly handle the RGBA conversion and background pasting.
- Use `elif` to properly handle the case where the image is in a different mode, and only convert it to RGB if it's not already in that mode.
- Add a check at the beginning of the function to return the image as is if its format is already 'JPEG'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG':
        return image, None
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
