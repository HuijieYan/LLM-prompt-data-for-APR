Based on the given information and the failing test, it seems that the `convert_image` function is not handling transparency properly when converting PNG images with an alpha channel (RGBA) to JPEG format.

The function has a conditional statement to check if the image is PNG with RGBA mode and then it creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting the mode to RGB. However, it seems that the way the background is created and the image is pasted onto it is causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we can change how the background is created and the image is pasted onto it when the input image is PNG with RGBA mode.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function correctly handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to JPEG format and should pass the failing test.
