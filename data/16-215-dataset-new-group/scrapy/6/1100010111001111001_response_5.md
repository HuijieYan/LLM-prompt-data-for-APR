The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to handling images with transparency and converting them to JPEG format. The buggy function is not properly handling images with an RGBA mode and converting them to RGB mode before saving them as JPEG. 

The bug is likely causing the function to incorrectly handle transparency in PNG images and is not handling images in the 'P' mode properly.

To fix the bug, we should add logic to handle RGBA and P mode images separately and convert them to the correct format before saving as JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles the RGBA and P mode images separately, converting them to the correct format before saving as JPEG. This should address the issues with transparency and incorrect mode handling in the original function.
