## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the BytesIO object
    return image, buf
```

## Explanation:
The bug in the original function is in the line `background.paste(image, image)`. The correct syntax for the `paste` method is `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, which specifies the upper-left corner position to paste the image. Without specifying the position, the method was not functioning as expected.

Additionally, the BytesIO object needed to have its pointer reset to the start of the object before returning it, which is achieved by using `buf.seek(0)`.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct syntax for the `paste` method and includes `buf.seek(0)` to reset the pointer of the BytesIO object.

These changes will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
