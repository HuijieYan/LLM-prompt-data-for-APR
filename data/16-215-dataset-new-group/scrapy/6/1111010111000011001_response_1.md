The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, it should be converting the image to an RGB mode, but the code does not correctly handle the transparency of the image. It creates a new background image but does not consider the alpha channel correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. We should use the `convert` function to handle the transparency correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert RGBA to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This correction ensures that the function correctly converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, handling the transparency of the image properly.

The corrected function should pass all the test cases mentioned above, ensuring that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
