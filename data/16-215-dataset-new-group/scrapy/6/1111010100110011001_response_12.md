The issue with the buggy function is that when an image with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' is passed in, the function should convert it to an image with a mode of 'RGB'. However, in the conversion process, the alpha channel is not being fully taken into account, resulting in incorrect colors.

To fix this, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle the conversion of images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' to ensure that the alpha channel is correctly considered during the process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image.split()[3])  # Take the alpha channel into account
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now handle images of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' correctly, taking the alpha channel into account, and return the expected results.

The corrected function should now pass all the expected test cases provided.
