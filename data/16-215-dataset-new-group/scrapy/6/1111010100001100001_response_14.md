The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement checking for 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode is incorrectly converting the image to RGB if both conditions are met, but it should only convert the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. Additionally, there is a bug in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the second `image` should be replaced with the `(0, 0)` position tuple.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correct the conditional statement and the `paste` function call, and then handle the logic for converting the image to RGB only when the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle image format and mode conversions, and should pass the provided test cases.
