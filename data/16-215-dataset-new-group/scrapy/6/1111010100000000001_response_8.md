## Explanation
The buggy function `convert_image` contains the following potential errors:
1. The conditional statement for checking the image format and mode is not accurate and may not function as intended.
2. The use of `image` inside the `paste` method is incorrect and may cause an error.
3. The conversion to RGB mode may not be effective as expected.
4. The conversion to JPEG format may result in a loss of image quality.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Correct the conditional statement to accurately check for the image format and mode.
2. Change the `paste` method to use the correct parameters.
3. Ensure that the conversion to RGB mode is correctly applied.
4. Use a more appropriate format for saving the image, such as PNG to retain image quality.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf
```
