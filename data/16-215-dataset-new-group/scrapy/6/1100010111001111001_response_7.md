The bug in the given function is that it does not properly handle images with transparency (mode='RGBA'). When the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function should create a new background and paste the RGBA image onto it before converting it to RGB. However, it doesn't handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional statement to handle the case when the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. Inside this conditional statement, create a new background image and paste the input image onto it before converting it to RGB. This will ensure that the function handles images with transparency correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle images with transparency correctly and pass all the failing test cases.
