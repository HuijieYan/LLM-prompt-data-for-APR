The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly converts the image to RGB format in some cases, and also doesn't handle PNG images with RGBA mode. 

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of image formats and modes. The function doesn't correctly handle the case when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. Additionally, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB format in some cases, even if it's not necessary. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and improve the logic for converting images to RGB format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, and if so, we convert it to RGB format. Then, we check if the image is not in RGB format, and if so, we also convert it to RGB format. Finally, we proceed with the thumbnail creation and saving the image in JPEG format.

This corrected version of the function should now handle the different image formats and modes as expected, satisfying all the input/output values.
