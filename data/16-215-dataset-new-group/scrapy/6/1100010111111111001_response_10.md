The function has a logic error in the image conversion process. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it tries to convert the transparency to white and then convert the image to 'RGB'. However, this approach might not retain the original colors and transparency of the image correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the image conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode. We should convert the image directly to RGB without changing the transparency.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
