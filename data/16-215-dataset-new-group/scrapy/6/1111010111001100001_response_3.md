The bug in the `convert_image` function appears to be related to the image format and mode checks. When the format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, the function attempts to create a new image with an 'RGB' mode, but the background is not being converted to 'RGB' properly. This leads to incorrect output and fails the test cases.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the background image is properly converted to 'RGBA' before pasting the original image onto it. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the original image is in palette mode ('P').

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a new RGBA background with an alpha channel properly set to 255.
- We paste the original RGBA image onto the background, ensuring that the pasting position is specified.
- When the original image is not in RGB mode, we convert it to RGB.
- We handle the size parameter correctly to create the thumbnail.
- Finally, we save the image to the buffer as JPEG and return both the image and the buffer.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
