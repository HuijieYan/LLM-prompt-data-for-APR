The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of images with transparency, specifically when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.

The bug appears to be in the conditional block `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. In this block, the function is creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it, then converting the result to RGB. This approach is likely causing the loss of transparency information when the image is converted to RGB format.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to preserve the transparency information when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. This can be achieved by using the `image.convert` method and specifying the desired mode, without creating a new background image.

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function is provided below:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and preserve their transparency.

After making this change, the provided failing test should pass, assuming that the `_create_image` function works as intended and produces images with the specified format and mode.

In summary, the correction involves simplifying the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode and ensuring that transparency information is preserved during the conversion process.
