The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode, leading to incorrect color values and failing the tests. Additionally, the function always saves the image as a JPEG, regardless of its initial format.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the image is only converted to RGB mode if it is initially in RGBA or P mode. Then, we should save the image in its original format instead of enforcing it to be a JPEG.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should be able to handle images of different formats and modes correctly, passing the failing tests.
