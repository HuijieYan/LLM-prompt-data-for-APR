## Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and converts it to a different format and size if necessary. The function uses the Pillow library (`PIL`) to manipulate the image.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional statements might not be evaluating as expected.
2. There might be a problem with the image conversion and resizing logic.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug could be caused by the conditional statements not working as expected, leading to incorrect conversions and resizing of the image.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Validate the conditional statements to ensure they are evaluating properly.
2. Check the image conversion and resizing logic to ensure it is working as intended.

## Corrected Version
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Set the position back to the start of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. In the `background.paste` method, the coordinates `(0, 0)` are provided to paste the image at the top-left corner.
2. The `image.save` method specifies the `format` parameter as `'JPEG'` for saving the image in JPEG format.
3. After saving the image to the buffer, the position is set back to the start of the buffer using `buf.seek(0)`.
