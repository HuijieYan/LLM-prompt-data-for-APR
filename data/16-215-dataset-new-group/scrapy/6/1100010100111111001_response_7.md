The problem with the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the transparency of PNG images correctly. When converting a PNG image with an alpha channel to RGB, the function should blend the transparent parts of the image with a background color before converting it to RGB.

The bug is causing the test to fail, as it expects the transparency to be handled properly when converting PNG images.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle PNG images with alpha channels correctly by blending them with a white background before converting to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Blend the image with a white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function should handle PNG images with alpha channels correctly and pass the failing test.
