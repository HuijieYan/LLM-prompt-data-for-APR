The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing it to return incorrect values, leading to failing test cases. The bug seems to be in the image conversion logic.

In the first and second cases, when the input image is already in RGB mode, the function should simply resize the image and not convert it to RGB mode. However, the function is incorrectly converting the image to RGB mode, resulting in failing tests.

In the third case, when the input image is in RGBA mode, the function creates a new RGBA image with a white background and merges the input image onto the new background. This process should be correctly converting the image to RGB mode. However, it's not achieving the desired result, leading to failing tests.

In the fourth case, when the input image is in palette mode (P), the function should be converting the image to RGB mode. However, the bug is not correctly performing this conversion, leading to a failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to handle the different image modes appropriately, and ensure that the image conversion and resizing logic is correctly performed for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```
