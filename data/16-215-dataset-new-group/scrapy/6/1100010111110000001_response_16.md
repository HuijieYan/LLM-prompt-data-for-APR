There is an issue with the `convert_image` function that is causing it to fail the test. The failing test is testing various image conversion scenarios and the specified checks are failing during the test.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function can be the conversion logic based on the image format and mode. Also, there might be an issue with the thumbnail creation logic.

The cause of the bug is that the `convert_image` function does not handle the conversion and thumbnail creation logic correctly for different image formats and modes. This leads to failing the test cases because the converted images do not match the expected output.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic to correctly handle the conversion based on the image format and mode, as well as to ensure the thumbnail creation maintains the correct image ratio.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the conversion logic and thumbnail creation logic have been updated to correctly handle different image formats and modes. This should address the issue and make the `convert_image` function pass the failing test.
