The bug in the `convert_image` function is due to the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function is not correctly converting the image to RGB mode, resulting in incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode as intended, leading to incorrect output when trying to convert the image.

To fix the bug, the function should include a conditional statement to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function should create a new image with RGB mode and paste the input image onto it.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
