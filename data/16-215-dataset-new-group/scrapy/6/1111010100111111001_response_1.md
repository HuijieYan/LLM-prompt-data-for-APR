It seems that the bug is related to the conversion of image types and the pasting of RGBA images onto an RGB background.

The bug in the code is that when the input image has mode 'RGBA', the background should have an alpha channel, but it is initialized with a white color without an alpha channel. This causes the loss of transparency when pasting the original RGBA image onto the new background.

To fix this bug, we need to create a new RGBA image as the background when the input image has mode 'RGBA'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 0))  # Create a new RGBA image with an alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Pasting the original image onto the new background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
