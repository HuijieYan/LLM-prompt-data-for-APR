The cause of the bug in the provided function is the incorrect conversion of images with transparency. When an image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new 'RGBA' background and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to 'RGB'. However, this overwrites the alpha channel, resulting in incorrect colors in the output image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the function that handles PNG images with an RGBA mode. Instead of directly converting the image to RGB, we should create a new image with an RGB mode and handle the transparency correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the function correctly handles images with transparency, ensuring that the colors are preserved correctly during the conversion process.
