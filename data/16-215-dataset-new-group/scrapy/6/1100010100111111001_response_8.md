The bug in the convert_image function is related to the image transformation process. The function has several issues that affect different test cases. Here's a breakdown of the bugs and their respective solutions:

1. Case 1:
The input image is in JPEG format and RGB mode. The expected output is to maintain the same format and mode.

2. Case 2:
The input image is in JPEG format and RGB mode, and the size is specified as (10, 25). The expected output is to generate a thumbnail with a size of (10, 10).

3. Case 3:
The input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. The expected output is to convert it to RGB mode and maintain the transparency level.

4. Case 4:
The input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, but it is converted to a palette (P) mode before passing it to the function. The expected output is to convert it to RGB mode and maintain the transparency level.

To fix these issues, we need to address the following problems in the convert_image function:
1. The check for image mode before conversion is incorrect and could result in unnecessary conversions.
2. The thumbnail generation logic is incorrect, leading to unexpected sizes.
3. The transformation of RGBA images to RGB is not preserving the transparency level.
4. The conversion of images with different modes/distorted modes is not handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Convert RGBA images to RGB while preserving transparency
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        alpha = image.split()[-1]
        bg = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        bg.paste(image, mask=alpha)
        image = bg

    # Generate a thumbnail if size is specified
    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Convert any non-RGB images to RGB
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    # Create a buffer to save the image as JPEG
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```

The corrected function address the issues by:
1. Preserving the transparency level when converting RGBA images to RGB.
2. Generating thumbnails with the correct size when specifying a size parameter.
3. Converting non-RGB images to RGB.
4. Properly handling distorted modes or modes different from the expected RGB format.
