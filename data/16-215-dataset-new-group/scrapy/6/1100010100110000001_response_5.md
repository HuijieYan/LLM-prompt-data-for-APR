The buggy function is `convert_image`, which accepts an image and an optional size as input, and returns the converted image and a file buffer.

The failing test compares expected and actual image color attributes on the 'converted' image output of the `convert_image` function.

The cause of the bug is likely in the part of the function that handles the conversion of images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') and format 'PNG'.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the conversion logic for images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') and format 'PNG' is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', we create a new RGB background image, paste the RGBA image over it, and then convert it to RGB.
- For images with formats other than 'PNG' and modes other than 'RGB', we simply convert them to RGB.
- We maintain the thumbnail size logic and the saving logic.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with transparency and pass the failing test.
