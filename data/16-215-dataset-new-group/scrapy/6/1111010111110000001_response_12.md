The `convert_image` function is failing with the provided test because it does not properly handle images with transparency. The failing test is specifically checking the getcolors() method, which returns the color and frequency of each color in the image. The failure is due to a discrepancy between the expected colors and the actual colors in the converted images.

The bug is likely stemming from the conditional block that handles transparent images with RGBA format and PNG format. The bug seems to occur when the image contains transparency and is converted to a different format, causing the color values to be different.

The strategy for fixing the bug should involve revisiting the conditional block for handling images with different formats, specifically focusing on transparent images. Additionally, the `image.save()` method is currently hardcoded to save the image as JPEG, which might cause loss of transparency. The function should take the format into account and save the image in the same format as the input, unless specified otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA') or (image.mode != 'RGB'):
        # Use a white background and convert to RGB format for non-RGB images
        background = Image.new('RGBA' if image.mode == 'RGBA' else 'RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in the same format as the input image
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the conditional block is updated to handle transparent images properly. Additionally, the image is saved using the format from the input image to preserve transparency. This updated function should pass the failing test.
