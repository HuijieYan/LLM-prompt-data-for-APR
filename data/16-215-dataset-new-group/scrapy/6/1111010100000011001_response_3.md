The buggy function has a few issues:

1. The condition `elif image.mode != 'RGB':` is incorrect, as it is trying to check if the image is not in RGB mode. However, it should be checking for the 'RGBA' mode.

2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` is incorrect in the case where image format is PNG and mode is RGBA.

3. The function does not handle the case when the image is already in RGB mode and has a specific size requirement, without needing any conversion.

To fix the issues, the following strategy can be employed:
- Change the condition from `elif image.mode != 'RGB':` to `if image.mode == 'RGBA':` in order to correctly identify the RGBA image mode.
- Update the line `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` in the PNG and RGBA mode condition to correctly paste the image.
- Make sure to handle the case when the image is already in RGB mode and has a specific size requirement without needing any conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    if size:
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
With these changes, the corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values.
