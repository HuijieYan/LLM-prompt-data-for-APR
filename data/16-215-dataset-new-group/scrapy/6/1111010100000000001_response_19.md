The buggy function `convert_image` has a few potential error locations.

1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` may not be correct, as it's not checking for the image format and mode correctly.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` may cause an issue because the second argument should be a bounding box, not the actual image object.
3. The line `image = background.convert('RGB')` is converting the background image to RGB, but it should actually be converting the original image to RGB.

The cause of the bug may be that the conditions for checking the image format and mode are incorrect, and the handling of the image conversion is flawed.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
- Use the `image.format` and `image.mode` properties to correctly check the image format and mode.
- Use the `paste` method with the correct bounding box to merge the images.
- Convert the original image to RGB when the condition is met.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' or 'RGBA' in image.mode:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif 'RGB' not in image.mode:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
