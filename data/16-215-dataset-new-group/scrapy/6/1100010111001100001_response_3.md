The buggy function has several issues:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` to convert the PNG image with RGBA mode is incorrect, as the mode of a PNG image is usually 'RGBA' and not 'RGB' as suggested by the code.
2. Even when converting to RGB, the background is set to white, regardless of the original transparency of the image, leading to loss of transparency.
3. When resizing the image, it is overwritten on the original image instead of being assigned to a new variable.
4. The function is not returning the correct values and types of the output variables as defined in the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to address these issues. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = new_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
1. The condition to check the format and mode of the image is updated to convert images of format 'PNG' with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' mode. Additionally, if the image has a 'P' mode, it is first converted to 'RGBA' and then to 'RGB' mode.
2. When resizing the image, a new variable `new_image` is used to store the resized image without overwriting the original image.
3. The correct values and types of the output variables are returned based on the input parameters.

These changes should address the issues and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
