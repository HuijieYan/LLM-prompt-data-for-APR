The bug occurs in the original `convert_image` function as it fails to handle the image conversion correctly for both PNG and RGB images. The `convert_image` function should convert PNG images with an RGBA channel to RGB and handle the transparency effect properly.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the image modes and transparency. When the image is PNG with an RGBA mode, it does not handle the transparency channel and conversion to RGB correctly.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function should be modified to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and properly convert and save them as RGB.

Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function handles PNG images with RGBA and P modes correctly, converts them to RGB, and then saves them as JPEG. This fix should align with the expected input/output values and satisfy the failing test cases.
