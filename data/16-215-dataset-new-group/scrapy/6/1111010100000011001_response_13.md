The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it is incorrectly handling PNG images with RGBA mode, as well as the conversion and thumbnail creation logic, which results in unexpected behavior and incorrect outputs. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer pointer to the beginning before returning
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the `paste` function is used with correct arguments to paste the image onto the background and create a new RGB image.
2. After the conversion and thumbnail creation, the buffer pointer is moved to the beginning before returning.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values and types specified in the test cases.
