The bug is in the `convert_image` method of the `ImagesPipeline` class. The bug causes the function to incorrectly convert PNG images with RGBA mode to JPEG.

The bug occurs because the method attempts to save the image as JPEG regardless of its format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to add conditional statements to check the image format and mode before saving it as JPEG. Additionally, we should handle the case when the image is in RGBA mode and format is PNG.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` method:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The updated version checks the image format and mode before making any conversions and saving it as either PNG or JPEG based on the format. This should fix the bug and make the `convert_image` method work as expected.
