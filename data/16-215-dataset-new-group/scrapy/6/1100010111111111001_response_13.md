The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the conditional statement checking for the image format and mode. The bug arises when trying to convert an RGBA image to RGB format, and also in handling the case when the image mode is not RGB.

The bug causes the failing tests for the transparency cases, as the image mode and colors are not being handled correctly when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the RGBA image format correctly. Additionally, the code for handling the image modes other than RGB needs to be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function handles the RGBA image format correctly by creating a new RGB image and pasting the original image onto it. It also handles the conversion of images to RGB format when the mode is not RGB.

With these changes, the function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
