From the error message provided, it seems that the bug lies within the `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class. The failing test has multiple assertions and all pertain to the `converted` variable having different RGB values than expected.

The bug arises due to incorrect conversion of the PNG RGBA images into JPEG RGB images. This is due to the fact that background transparency is not handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to correctly handle the conversion of RGBA images into RGB images if they are in PNG format.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the image with its alpha channel
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with PNG RGBA images by creating a new RGB background and pasting the original image onto it using its alpha channel. This ensures that the transparency is handled correctly during the conversion.
