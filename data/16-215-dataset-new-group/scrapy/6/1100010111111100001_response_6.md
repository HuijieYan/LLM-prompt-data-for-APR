The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it does not correctly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode. The function is supposed to convert the input image to RGB mode and save it as a JPEG file while also handling the thumbnail generation with the correct aspect ratio.

The problem arises when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode. The function attempts to create a new RGB image as a background, paste the original image onto it, and then convert the result to RGB mode. This approach is incorrect and causes the function to produce unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode and ensure that the function correctly converts and saves the images.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA' and image.format == 'PNG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert RGBA to RGB mode for PNG images
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles PNG images with an RGBA mode by directly converting them to RGB mode. Additionally, it ensures that other image types are converted to RGB mode as well before thumbnail generation and saving.
