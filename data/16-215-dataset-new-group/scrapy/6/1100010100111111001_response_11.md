The bug in the provided function `convert_image` is that when the image format is `'P'` and mode is not `'RGB'`, the function incorrectly converts it to an RGB format without taking into consideration the image mode. This behavior causes the failing test cases, as the function does not handle the conversion properly for images with mode other than 'RGB' or 'RGBA'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle images with mode other than 'RGB' or 'RGBA' correctly. Additionally, we also need to ensure that the size is preserved when creating a thumbnail.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'RGBX':
        image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. I added a condition for handling the mode `'RGBX'`, which is another RGB mode.
2. For images with modes other than `'RGB'` and `'RGBX'`, we first convert them to RGBA and then to RGB to maintain transparency information if present.
3. When creating a thumbnail, I removed the `ANTIALIAS` argument as it's the default method for creating thumbnails in PIL.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test cases and handle images with different modes correctly.
