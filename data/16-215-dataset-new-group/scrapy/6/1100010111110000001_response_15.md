The buggy function `convert_image` seems to have issues with converting images to the correct format and size. It is not handling PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, and is causing issues with the transparency.

The issue is that when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function converts it to RGB format, but does not properly handle the transparency, resulting in a different color and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and consider the transparency when converting the image to RGB format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # If the image is not in RGB mode, convert it
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Resize the image if a size is specified
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=95)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the function handles PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new image with a white background and preserving the alpha channel when converting to RGB. This should properly handle the transparency and ensure that the converted image matches the expected results.
