The buggy function has a few issues:
1. When checking the format and mode of the image, it incorrectly assumes that images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' need to be converted to 'RGB'. This is incorrect as images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' can be saved as they are without needing to be converted to 'RGB'.
2. When creating the background image, the code uses `background.paste(image, image)`, which is incorrect. The second parameter should be a tuple or a box, for example `background.paste(image, (0, 0))`.
3. No error handling for `image.format` when `image` comes from different sources.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to first handle images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA' differently by directly saving them without converting them to 'RGB'. Then, update the pasting function by providing the correct coordinates. Finally, add error handling for when `image.format` is not available or not matching the requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format and image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        return image, image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
