The bug in the convert_image function lies in the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the background is created, but when pasting the image onto the background, the correct composite operation is not specified. This causes the RGBA channels to mix with the white background and lose the original transparency information.

To fix the bug, the correct composite operation should be used to paste the image onto the background.

In addition, the bug also lies in the saving of the image as JPEG without specifying the quality parameter. By default, it will use a different quality setting and may result in different image quality than expected. 

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    mode = 'RGB'
    if image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        mode = 'RGB'
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=95)
    return image, buf
```

The changes made include:
- For PNG images in RGBA mode, the correct composite operation is used to preserve the transparency information.
- When saving the image as JPEG, the quality parameter is explicitly specified.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
