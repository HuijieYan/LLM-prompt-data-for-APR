The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues that need to be addressed in order to pass the failing test:
1. The first issue is with the line `background.paste(image, image)`. The `paste` method only accepts an image, not an image and a tuple of two image objects. This is likely causing the failed conversion from RGBA to RGB as the method is being misused.
2. The second issue is that the `image` should be returned after saving it to the buffer `buf` and not before that. The current return statement should be placed at the end of the function.
3. The final issue is that the `image.save` method is being called with the format `'JPEG'` regardless of the original image format.

To address these issues, the following corrections should be made:
- Remove the incorrect usage of `background.paste` and replace it with `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))` to properly paste the image onto the background.
- Move the line `buf = BytesIO()` to the beginning of the function in order to create an empty buffer.
- Update `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` to `image.save(buf, image.format)` so that the image is saved in its original format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    buf = BytesIO()  # Move the buffer creation to the beginning
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))  # Fix the background.paste method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
    return image, buf  # Return the image and the buffer
```

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test.
