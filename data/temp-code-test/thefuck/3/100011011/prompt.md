Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values, the GitHub issue.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test, resolve the issue posted in GitHub.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

### The error message from the failing test
```text
self = <tests.shells.test_fish.TestFish object at 0x7fb8d3a45250>
shell = <thefuck.shells.fish.Fish object at 0x7fb8d3bd0290>
Popen = <MagicMock name='Popen' id='140431801350288'>

    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
>       assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
E       AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
E         - Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9

tests/shells/test_fish.py:118: AssertionError

```



## Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
proc, value: `<MagicMock name='Popen()' id='140050497243408'>`, type: `MagicMock`

version, value: `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, type: `str`

proc.stdout.read, value: `<MagicMock name='Popen().stdout.read' id='140050497377296'>`, type: `MagicMock`

proc.stdout, value: `<MagicMock name='Popen().stdout' id='140050497379088'>`, type: `MagicMock`



## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.

Reference: oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11
