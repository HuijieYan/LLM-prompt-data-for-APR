Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test.

## A test function that the buggy function fails
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py

def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```
