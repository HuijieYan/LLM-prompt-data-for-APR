The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the condition to check if the current line is empty (after stripping) and the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is flawed because it does not account for cases where the line is non-empty but only contains spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition to consider the case when the line only consists of spaces. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() or current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the condition has been updated to `if current_line.strip() or current_column < column` to handle the case where the line contains only spaces but no visible characters. This change ensures that the function correctly handles the scenario where the line should be consumed based on the specified column value.
