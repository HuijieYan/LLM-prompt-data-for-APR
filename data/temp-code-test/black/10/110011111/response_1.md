### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming part of a given prefix based on indentation and column values. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of newline characters and determining when to split lines correctly. The function needs to ensure that the comment's indentation aligns with the corresponding code line after dedenting.

The failing test case highlights discrepancies in comment indentation after dedenting, indicating a flaw in how the function handles specific characters like '\n', ' ', and '\t'. The current implementation does not handle the newline character and column values properly, leading to incorrect splitting and merging of lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the newline character, column values, and the alignment of comments after dedenting. The function should split lines based on proper indentation rules to maintain the desired code format, as indicated in the failing test case.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1

        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4

        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the necessary adjustments to handle newline characters and indentation correctly, this corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output formatting.
