### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit. The function tracks the lines, current line content, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle newline characters.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when processing a new line character (`'\n'`). In the original implementation, the condition check after encountering `'\n'` resets the `current_column` to 0 even when it should not. This incorrect reset leads to incorrect calculations of the current column and, eventually, incorrect handling of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for processing the `'\n'` character. Instead of always resetting the `current_column` to 0, we should update it only if the current line is not empty. This adjustment will ensure that the column count is maintained correctly.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():  # Check if the current line is not empty
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment in the fixed function, the function should now correctly handle newline characters and maintain the current column count as expected in the failing test cases.
