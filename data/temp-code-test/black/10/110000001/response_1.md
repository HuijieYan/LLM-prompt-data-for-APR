## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class. This function is designed to partially consume the input `prefix` string up to a certain `column` limit, based on indentation rules.

## Identified Errors:
1. The `lines` list is not being fully utilized. It should be used to store complete lines, not just part of them.
2. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is incorrectly checking if the stripped `current_line` is not empty. It should be checking if the stripped line exceeds the desired column limit.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in how it handles the condition for checking if the current line exceeds the desired column limit. Due to incorrect logic using `current_line.strip()` instead of comparing the column limit with the length of the stripped line, the function fails to accurately determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` to correctly compare the length of the stripped `current_line` with the desired column limit.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(current_line.strip()) > column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if len(current_line.strip()) > column:` has been introduced to accurately determine when the desired column limit is exceeded. This fix ensures that the function correctly consumes the prefix according to the specified rules.
