### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function of the `driver.py` file. The function is designed to process prefix text, specifically handling indentation levels and comments. The issue arises when processing comments after dedentations with tabs.

The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of different characters (like spaces, tabs, new lines) within the loop and the logic determining when to manipulate `current_line` and `current_column`. In cases where comments are placed after dedentations, the logic fails to correctly handle the indentation level, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling characters, especially when encountering comments after dedentations. We should ensure that the correct column is maintained for such scenarios and extract or append the processed lines appropriately.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    lines[-1] += current_line  # Append the line to the last element in the list
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version ensures that the `current_line` handling and column tracking are appropriate for scenarios with comments after dedentations. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure correct processing of prefix text.
