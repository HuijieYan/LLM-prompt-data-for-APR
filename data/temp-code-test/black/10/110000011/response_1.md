### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for consuming a prefix of a given string while maintaining the column count and handling indentations. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the tab characters and changing the indentation level for comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters may be incorrect, causing issues with maintaining proper indentation levels.
2. The logic for wait_for_nl and handling the end of indentation might have issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from the way tab characters are handled in the function. When encountering a tab character, the function is incorrectly incrementing the `current_column` by 4 instead of following the rules related to tab spacing. This leads to incorrect calculation of column positions and eventually affects the behavior of handling comments after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic related to handling tab characters to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated based on tab spacing rules.
2. Review and refine the logic for `wait_for_nl` and the end of indentation to ensure correct behavior when processing prefixes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust current_column based on tab spacing rules
                current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been modified to correctly update the `current_column` based on tab spacing rules. This adjustment should ensure that the function maintains the correct column positions and avoids issues related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
