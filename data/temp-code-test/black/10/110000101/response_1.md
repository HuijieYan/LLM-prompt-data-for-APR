### Analysis
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function takes a `prefix` (string) and `column` (int) as input parameters.
- It iterates over each character in the `prefix` string and processes it based on certain conditions.
- The function keeps track of `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `lines` (list of strings).
- The main goal of the function seems to be to partially consume the `prefix` until a certain column limit is reached.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The logic for updating the `lines` list is incorrect, leading to incorrect slicing of the `prefix` string.
2. Incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition which can lead to early reset of `current_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Revise the logic for updating the `lines` list to correctly capture the consumed lines.
2. Adjust the conditions related to `wait_for_nl` to ensure the correct handling of newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the prefix consumption based on the specified column limit and newline characters.
