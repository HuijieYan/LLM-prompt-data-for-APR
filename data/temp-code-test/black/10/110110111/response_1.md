### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a portion of a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, based on the failing test case provided, the function does not handle the indentation correctly when dealing with tabs and comments.
2. The failing test case focuses on verifying the correct indentation of comments after dedents when using tabs in the input content.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test case, the expected output is `'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'`, which indicates that after a dedent, the comment line should be properly aligned with the surrounding code.
2. The actual output provided by the buggy function results in an incorrect alignment of the comment line after a dedent, leading to the assertion failure shown in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab indentation and comment alignment after dedents. Ensure that the function preserves the correct alignment of comments relative to the surrounding code.
2. Implement logic to maintain consistent indentation levels for comments following dedents, irrespective of the presence of tabs or spaces in the input content.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments following dedents, ensuring alignment with the surrounding code.
