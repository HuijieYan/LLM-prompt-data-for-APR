### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume part of a prefix string based on a specified column value. It identifies lines based on indentation but has issues with handling newlines and waiting for the next newline.
2. The function has logical errors in tracking the current line, column, and waiting for the next newline. It fails to properly handle cases where indentation is followed by a newline character.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly track the current line content, resulting in incorrect line separations and content retention.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of newlines and correct assignment of line content during iteration through the prefix string.

### Correction:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling the newline character and resetting the line content, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
