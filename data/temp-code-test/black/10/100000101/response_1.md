The buggy function has an issue where it incorrectly handles the case when a newline character is encountered. It resets the `current_column` to 0 instead of continuing from the existing value when a newline is found, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` should retain its current value and not reset to 0.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column += 1  # Ensure the column increments after newline
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` value is maintained correctly even when encountering newline characters.
