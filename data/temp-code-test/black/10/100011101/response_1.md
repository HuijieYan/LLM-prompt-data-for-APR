The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it doesn't correctly handle indentation levels when consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect slicing of the prefix, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The main issue is that when encountering whitespace (spaces or tabs) in the prefix, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by fixed amounts (`1` for spaces and `4` for tabs). Instead, it should account for the actual indentation level that whitespace represents.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in handling whitespace characters to accurately track the current column based on the indentation level. We can modify the cases for dealing with spaces and tabs to correctly calculate the `current_column`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char.isspace():
                if char == '\t':
                    space_count = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                    current_column += space_count
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug by accurately calculating the indentation level based on spaces and tabs. It should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the prefix consumption.
