### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where the function checks if the current line is not empty and if the `current_column` is less than the given `column` value. However, the bug occurs because the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not correctly handling the indentation levels with tabs and spaces in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function should correctly calculate the effective column based on the mixed tabs and spaces indentation in the prefix string. This can be achieved by calculating the effective column using both tabs and spaces to accurately compare it with the given `column` value. Additionally, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabs in the indentation.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                effective_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
                if current_line.strip() and effective_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly calculating the effective column using `len(current_line.expandtabs())` and comparing it with the given `column` value, the corrected version of the function should now handle mixed tabs and spaces indentation correctly and pass the failing test case.
