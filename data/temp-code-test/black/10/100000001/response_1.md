## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column position. It processes characters in the input prefix string, keeping track of the current line, current column, and detecting newline characters to handle indentation.

## Identified issues:
1. The logic for handling a newline character is incorrect. When encountering a newline character, the function resets the `current_column` to 0, which is incorrect behavior.
2. The condition for checking if the current line is empty is not correctly placed, leading to incorrect detection of when to return the consumed part of the prefix.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by resetting the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly for each character based on tabs and spaces. Check for an empty line within the loop itself instead of treating it as a separate condition.

## Corrected version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition for resetting `current_column` upon encountering a newline character is removed. The check for an empty line and the column limit is properly placed within the loop to ensure the correct handling of indentation and column constraints.
