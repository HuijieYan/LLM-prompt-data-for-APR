### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix string and updates the current line, column, and waits for a newline character.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation. It fails to properly consume and remove the unnecessary indentation (spaces or tabs) before the actual content.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function can correctly handle and format the given indentation in the prefix string.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of consuming the prefix characters based on the specified column.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the column requirement is not met after consuming a newline character. This leads to incorrect indentation removal and results in a misaligned output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes characters from the prefix string based on the specified column. We should update the logic to handle indentation properly and remove any unnecessary spaces or tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line.strip())
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ' '.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these corrections to the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it should now be able to correctly handle the indentation and consume the prefix string based on the specified column. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
