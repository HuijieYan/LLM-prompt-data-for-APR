The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to how it handles the case when encountering a newline character but without waiting for a new line (indentation is finished). This causes the function to incorrectly parse the prefix input.

The issue arises from the logic inside the `elif char == '\n':` block. When encountering a newline character, the function does not reset the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` flags correctly. This leads to incorrect processing of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `elif char == '\n':` block needs to be adjusted to reset the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` flags appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the newline characters and reset the necessary variables, ensuring the correct parsing of the prefix input.
