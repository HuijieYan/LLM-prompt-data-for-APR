## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on certain conditions.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to check the indentation of comments in a code snippet.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
4. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) while processing the prefix, which causes incorrect indentation handling.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the function does not properly reset the `current_column` when encountering a newline character (`\n`).
- This leads to incorrect handling of indentation and causes comments to be misaligned after dedent operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is reset to `0` whenever a newline character is encountered in the prefix.

## Corrected Version of `_partially_consume_prefix`:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()  # Remove leading whitespace
                if current_line and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` to `0` whenever a newline character is encountered, this corrected version of the function should handle the prefix processing correctly and align the comments properly after dedent operations.
