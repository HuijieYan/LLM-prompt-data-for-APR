### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix up to a certain column while handling newline characters and preserving indentation levels.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling indentation levels with spaces or tabs.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` fails due to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
4. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments, leading to differing outputs.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with tabulated comments after a dedent, indicating an incorrect handling of indentation in such cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from the improper handling of indentation levels when encountering tabs or spaces. The function fails to maintain consistent indentation of comments, leading to differing outputs and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels when encountering tabs or spaces, especially in cases involving comments. Adjusting the logic to handle tabs and spaces consistently should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs to increment `current_column` by the appropriate value (e.g., 4 for a tab width of 4 spaces), the corrected function should now properly maintain consistent indentation levels when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent operation. This correction aims to align with the reported issue on GitHub related to tabulated comments' incorrect indentation.
