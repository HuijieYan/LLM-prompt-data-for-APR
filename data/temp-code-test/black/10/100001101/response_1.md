The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `current_column` variable. The function fails to update `current_column` correctly when encountering a newline character ('\n'), leading to incorrect behavior during prefix consumption.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `current_column` is reset to 0 when encountering a newline character, as it signifies the start of a new line. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly calculates the column position during prefix consumption.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function ensures that `current_column` is properly updated when encountering newline characters, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
