### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix under certain conditions related to columns and line breaks.
2. The function maintains variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the progress.
3. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of different characters in the input prefix, causing misalignment of comments with respect to the code.
4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle indentations and newlines based on the provided column values and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of tabulation characters and the expected column value. The function fails to correctly identify the end of an indent block when encountering mixed characters (spaces and tabs).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the character processing logic to correctly handle tabs and spaces for maintaining indentation levels.
2. Adjust the column tracking to ensure that the function correctly aligns comments based on the specified column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust the tab space to align with the next multiple of 4
                current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By improving the handling of tabs, spaces, and columns in the corrected version above, the function should now effectively consume the prefix according to the specified criteria, addressing the indent misalignment issue identified in the GitHub report.
