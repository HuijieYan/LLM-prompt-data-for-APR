### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in Python code by consuming a prefix string up to a specified column number.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the output of the function to the expected indentation style of comments in Python code.
3. The current bug causes the function to handle tab characters incorrectly, leading to incorrect indentation when dealing with comments after dedentations.
4. The failing test case provides input with tabs, while the expected output assumes correct indentation handling.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem related to indentation changes for tabulated comments post dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters by the function, leading to discrepancies in the expected indentation. The function does not process tab characters appropriately, resulting in incorrect column calculations after a dedent.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to correctly handle tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` by the appropriate amount for each tab.
2. Ensure that the function maintains accurate column tracking to correctly handle indentations and comments after dedentations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Increment current_column by 4 for each tab character
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\n', '\t']:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    # Handle remaining prefix lines
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version increments the `current_column` properly based on tab or space characters and resolves the issue with incorrect indentation for comments after dedent. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
