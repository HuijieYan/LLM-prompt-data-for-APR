The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical flaw when handling the condition for detecting the end of an indent. The issue seems to stem from the incorrect identification of when to wait for a newline character (`\n`) before considering the current line as part of the prefix string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to correctly handle the new line character and reset the current column count when necessary. We should ensure that the current line is updated correctly and check for the correct conditions to determine when to wait for a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the identification of the end of indents correctly, especially when new line characters are involved. It addresses the issue stated in the GitHub problem description by correctly preserving the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
