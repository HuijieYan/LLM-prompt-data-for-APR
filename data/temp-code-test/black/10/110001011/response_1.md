### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column.
2. The function maintains a list of lines, the current line being constructed, the current column position, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle character types like space, tabs, and newline.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior with tab characters and indentation levels after a dedent operation.
4. The GitHub issue provides an example where comments with tab characters are misaligned after a dedent operation in the code.

### Error Locations:
1. The issue arises when dealing with tab characters and their impact on column positioning.
2. The logic for handling tab characters does not correctly adjust the column position.
3. The function does not consider the impact of tabs on indentation levels in the code.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function fails to correctly handle tab characters and their impact on the column position.
2. When encountering tabs, the function increases the column position by a fixed value of 4, without considering the actual tab width.
3. This leads to incorrect calculation of the current column position, causing misalignment and indentation issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling tab characters to increment the column position based on the actual tab width.
2. Adjust the wait condition to correctly handle tab characters and their impact on the current column position.
3. Ensure that the function accurately calculates the column position when encountering tabs or other whitespace characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the actual tab width instead of incrementing by a fixed value
            tab_width = 4
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Bug Fix Summary:
1. Updated the logic for handling tab characters to calculate the actual tab width and adjust the column position accordingly.
2. This modification ensures that tabs are correctly handled and do not cause misalignment or indentation issues during prefix consumption.
3. The corrected function now accurately processes tab characters and maintains the expected column positions.
