The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect handling of spaces and tabs, leading to incorrect line indentation. The function fails to properly handle indentation levels and stops prematurely.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for tracking indentation levels and monitor when to wait for a new line. Specifically, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies when a new line should start based on the provided indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now handle the indentation and line breaks correctly, passing the failing test provided.
