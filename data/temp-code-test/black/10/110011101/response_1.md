### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given `prefix` string up to a certain `column`, returning the consumed part and the remaining part. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles lines that are not indented properly based on the given `column`.

### Identifying the bug

From the provided runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it is clear that the function is not correctly handling the cases where the indentation of the current line does not match the provided `column`. This leads to incorrect handling of the prefix, resulting in unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Explanation of the bug

The issue arises when the function encounters a character that does not match the expected indentation level (specified by the `column`). In such cases, it incorrectly resets the `current_column` and does not append the current line to the list of lines. This causes the eventual output to omit lines that do not conform to the provided `column`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles lines that do not match the specified `column`. This involves properly appending such lines to the output and resetting the necessary variables to handle the next line correctly.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that lines not meeting the expected indentation level are correctly appended to the output list of lines. Additionally, it handles the case where the whole prefix is consumed, ensuring accurate output.
