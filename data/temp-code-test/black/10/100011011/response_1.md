### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when it encounters a comment line after indentations. The function incorrectly handles the logic for waiting for a newline character before processing the comment indentation. This results in the incorrect handling of comment line indentations, leading to differences in formatted output compared to the expected output.

The specific issue arises from the incorrect accumulation and splitting of lines when processing comments following indentations. The function fails to update the current column properly, leading to discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To correct the bug, the function should track the current column appropriately and ensure that it correctly handles the indentations of comment lines according to the specified column. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a newline character before processing comments needs to be refined to align with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By refining the logic for handling comment lines and updating the current column appropriately, the corrected function should now process the input prefix correctly and generate the expected output, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.
