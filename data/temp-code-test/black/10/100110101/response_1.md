### Fixing the bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how the newline character is handled. When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0, but in cases where newlines are followed by spaces or tabs, the column count is not updated accordingly. This results in incorrect output when comparing the formatted strings.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic related to handling newline characters and updating the current column count.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the handling of newline characters to properly reset the current column count based on indentation levels. This should address the bug and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the test cases provided.
