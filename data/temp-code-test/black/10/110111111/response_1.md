## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume only part of the prefix string up to a certain column value based on indentation. The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character and should check if the current line contains any non-whitespace characters within the specified `column`, but the logic for this check is flawed. This results in incorrect splitting of the prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates a discrepancy in the expected and actual output involving comments indentation after a dedent. The error message specifies the mismatch in the comments' indentation in the reformatted code.

The runtime values and types of variables in the buggy function reflect inconsistent behavior based on different input parameters, concluding that the logic within the function is not handling whitespace characters and newlines correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the logic for tracking whitespace characters and newlines leading to correct indentation handling needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should correctly detect the end of the indentation block and decide on the continuation based on the current column value compared to the specified column.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char.isspace():
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By enhancing the condition checks for whitespace characters and newlines, the corrected function should now handle prefix string splitting based on the specified column value, correctly handling indentation for comments after a dedent. This updated logic should resolve the indentation issue pointed out in the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
