The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of the indentation while consuming the prefix string. The function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level when encountering comments, leading to incorrect detection of column values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of whitespace characters, especially tabs and spaces.
2. Incorrect update of the `current_column` value when consuming the prefix.
3. Inadequate handling of the wait state for newline characters after indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not properly tracking and adjusting the `current_column` value when processing different types of characters in the prefix string, specifically when encountering comments. This leads to incorrect comparison of indentation levels and results in failing test cases.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation level by adjusting the `current_column` value according to the encountered characters. Proper handling of tabs, spaces, newlines, and comments is essential for correct indentation evaluation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            elif char != '#':
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function provided above, the function should now properly handle the indentation, including comments, and pass the failing test cases as expected.
