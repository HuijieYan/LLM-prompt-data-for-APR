### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for processing prefix text in the context of comments and indentation.
2. The function iterates over characters in the prefix, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines to adjust indentation levels.
3. The bug seems to occur when processing comments after an indentation level change.
4. Considering the failing test case related to comment indentation issues, the function may not correctly handle special cases involving comment indentation after dedent operations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when processing comments after a dedent operation. The function does not appropriately adjust the column count for comment lines following a dedent, leading to incorrect comment indentation in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Introduce specific handling for comment lines after dedent indicators to ensure proper indentations are maintained.
- When encountering comment lines after dedent, adjust the column count accordingly to prevent incorrect indentation.

### Corrected Function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        processed = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    processed = True
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
            # Handle comments after dedent
            if char == '#' and processed:
                lines[-1] += char  # Adjust the last line of the list for the comment
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional handling for comment lines after dedent operations. By ensuring adjustments to the last line of the processed lines list, the function should now properly maintain comment indentation levels.
