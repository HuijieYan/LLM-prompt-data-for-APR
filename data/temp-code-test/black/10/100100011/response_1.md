### Analysis:
Upon analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we can see that it is intended to partially consume a prefix text until a specific column is reached. The function struggles with properly handling the indentation of comments as described in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of handling tabulation (`\t`) characters within the prefix text. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4. This discrepancy in handling tabs results in incorrect column tracking and therefore incorrect indentation alignment.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function wrongly assumes that each tab character (`\t`) should increment the column by 4. This assumption leads to the incorrect calculation of column position, causing the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how tab characters are counted in the `current_column`. Instead of incrementing by 4 for each tab character encountered, we should only increment by 1 to match the actual tab width in the text.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust tab character column increment to 1 instead of 4
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle tab characters properly and align comment indentation as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation in the GitHub issue.
