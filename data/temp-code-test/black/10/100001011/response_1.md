The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to handling the correct column position and the lines when encountering certain characters like '\n' or ' '.

Based on the provided runtime values and types for different cases, we can identify a common issue in the function. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering new lines or special characters. This leads to incorrect line formation and causes issues with the prefix column alignment.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the indentation level (`current_column`) is updated correctly and that the lines are constructed properly based on the prefix and the desired column. Additionally, we need to correctly handle the cases of encountering tab characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * next_tab
            current_column += next_tab
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels, construct the lines based on the prefix and the desired column, and handle tab characters appropriately.
