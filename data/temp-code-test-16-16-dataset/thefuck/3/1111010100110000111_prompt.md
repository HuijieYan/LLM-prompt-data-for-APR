## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.

Reference: oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11
