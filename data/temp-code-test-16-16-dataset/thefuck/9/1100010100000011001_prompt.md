Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the expected input/output values.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the expected input/output variable values.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```




## Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

### Expected case 1
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
command.script_parts, 

command, 

command.stderr, 

#### Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, expected value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`
