## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
