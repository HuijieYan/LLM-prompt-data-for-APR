## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script by spaces and checking if the second element is 'stash', and if the error message contains 'usage:'. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which implies that the split operation is resulting in an empty list, causing the indexing to be out of range.

## Potential error location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is when trying to access the second element after splitting the script by spaces.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script always has at least two elements after splitting by spaces. If the command script is empty or contains only one element, it will result in an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split operation results in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can prevent the IndexError from occurring.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split list is at least 2 before comparing the second element and checking for the 'usage:' in the error message. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an IndexError.
