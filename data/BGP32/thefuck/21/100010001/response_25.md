## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command involves the Git stash functionality and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the split() function in the buggy function is trying to access an index that is out of range.
3. The buggy function splits the command by whitespace and attempts to access the second element assuming it refers to the command itself. However, if there are no elements after the split (e.g. an empty command), an IndexError is raised.
4. To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1.

## Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) >= 2 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command before accessing index 1, we ensure that the program does not encounter an IndexError. This fix will enable the function to correctly identify commands related to Git stash with the appropriate stderr message.
