## Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the message "list index out of range". This suggests that the `split()` method used on `command.script` is not returning a list with enough elements to access element at index 1.

## Potential Error Location:
1. The error is likely due to `command.script.split()` not providing enough elements.
2. Specifically, if `command.script` does not contain any whitespace to split on, `split()` will return a list with only one element.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function attempts to access index 1 of the list returned by `split()`, which can lead to an `IndexError` if the list is too short, i.e., if `command.script` does not contain a second element after splitting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to ensure that `split()` provides enough elements in the list before attempting to access index 1.
2. One way to handle this is to first check if the split list has enough elements before accessing index 1.
3. If there aren't enough elements after splitting, then the function should return `False`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By storing the result of `command.script.split()` in a variable `split_script`, we can check if the list has enough elements before accessing index 1. This correction should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
