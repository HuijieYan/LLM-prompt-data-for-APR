## Analysis:
- The `match` function takes a `Command` object as input, which has attributes `script`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.
- The function is checking if the second element in the split `script` is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in `stderr`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` at `command.script.split()[1]`, which means that the split result does not have a second element, causing the index to go out of range.

## Bug:
The bug occurs because the `script` attribute of the `Command` object may not have enough elements to split into before accessing the second element.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `script` attribute can be split into at least two parts before accessing the second part.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `split_script` before accessing the second element, we can ensure that the bug causing the `IndexError` is fixed.
