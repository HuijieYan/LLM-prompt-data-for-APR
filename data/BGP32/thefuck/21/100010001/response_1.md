## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the bug occurs at line 8 of the buggy function `match`. The error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs because the `.split()` method on `command.script` is being called without first verifying if the split will return at least 2 elements.

## Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always contain at least 2 elements when split.
2. In cases where `command.script` doesn't have at least 2 elements, the split operation will result in an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Before attempting to access the second element of the split array, we need to check if the split operation actually returned enough elements.
2. We should also ensure that the error message contains the desired substring before checking further.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script by whitespace
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the split operation returned at least 2 elements
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By incorporating the fix above, we first split `command.script` and then check if the split result contains at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when splitting a string that doesn't have enough elements.
