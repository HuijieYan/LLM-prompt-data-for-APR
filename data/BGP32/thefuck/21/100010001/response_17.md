### Analysis:
The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the code is attempting to access an index in a list that does not exist. This is likely happening in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where the code is trying to access the second element of the split command script. If the command script does not have enough elements, it will result in an IndexError.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is causing an error because it assumes the command script will always have at least 2 elements when split. If the command script is empty or only has one element, then trying to access the second element will result in an IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split command script before accessing any specific index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before attempting to access the second element, we ensure that we avoid the IndexError.
