### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the split `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `stderr` of the command. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically "list index out of range", which suggests that the split method is not creating a list with elements as expected.

### Identified Issue:
The error occurs because the `command.script` may not have any spaces, so splitting it doesn't result in multiple elements. That causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements after splitting `command.script`. If there are not enough elements, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We split `command.script` first and store the result in `script_parts`.
- We then check if the `script_parts` has at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. If there are not enough elements, the function will return `False`.
- If there are enough elements, we proceed with the original check for 'stash' and 'usage:' in `stderr`.
