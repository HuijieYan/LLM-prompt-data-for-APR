### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` at line 8 in the `match` function.
2. The buggy function tries to split the command script by whitespace and then access the second element `[1]`, but this assumes that there are at least 2 elements in the split result. If there is only one element, an `IndexError` will occur when trying to access the second element.
3. The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command has more than one word (at least one space in between). In this case, the `git` command is the only word in the script, leading to the `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that there are at least two elements after splitting the command script before attempting to access the second element.
  
### Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access the second element, we ensure that the code will not encounter an `IndexError` when there is only one element in the `script_parts`. This fix will prevent the bug and allow the function to work correctly in all cases.
