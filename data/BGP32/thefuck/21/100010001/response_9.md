## Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element in the split list of `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically "list index out of range", suggesting that the split operation is resulting in a list with less than two elements.

## Bug:
- The bug occurs when `command.script` does not contain enough elements to split into a list with at least 2 elements.

## Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of `script_parts`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when there are not enough elements to split in `command.script`.
