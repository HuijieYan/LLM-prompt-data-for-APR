## Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is using `split()` method on the `command.script` to extract the second word in the command.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the `split()` method is not able to split the `command.script` into a list with at least two elements.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The `command.script` might be empty.
- The `command.script` might not have the required format for split to work correctly.

## Cause of Bug:
- If the `command.script` is empty or doesn't have any spaces to split on, the `split()` method will not return a list with at least two elements, causing the `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` is not empty and has the format that allows splitting at least on the second element.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version splits the `command.script` into words and then checks if the length of the split words list is greater than 1, ensuring that we have at least two elements to access. Then, it checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
