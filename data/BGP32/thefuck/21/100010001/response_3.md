## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` due to trying to access an element of a list that doesn't exist.
2. The buggy function is trying to split the input script by spaces and access the second element `[1]`, assuming it exists.
3. The cause of the bug is the assumption that the script will have at least 2 elements after splitting by spaces.
4. A strategy to fix the bug is to first check if the script contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

## Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the list `script_parts` has more than 1 element before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
