### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the error message
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the error output. The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by trying to access the second element of a list produced by splitting an empty string.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is when trying to access the second element of the list produced by splitting the script, which can lead to an IndexError if the script is empty.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()` without first checking if the list has at least two elements. This can happen when the script is empty, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we ensure that an `IndexError` will not occur. This corrected version of the `match` function should now pass the failing test.
