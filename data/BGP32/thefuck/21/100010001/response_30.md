### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to match a specific condition based on the command passed to it. In this case, it is checking if the command script contains "stash" and if the command stderr contains "usage:". However, the error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that the split() method on the command script is failing due to a lack of elements to split.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line where `command.script.split()[1]` is being accessed. If the split() method does not return at least two elements, accessing index 1 will result in an IndexError.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the script in the command object does not always contain the minimum number of elements required for the split() method to work as expected. This results in the IndexError when trying to access the element at index 1.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the split() method does not return enough elements. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing index 1.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script and store the result in a variable `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before accessing the element at index 1. If the length is not sufficient, we return False. This fix ensures that we avoid the IndexError by only accessing index 1 when it is safe to do so.
