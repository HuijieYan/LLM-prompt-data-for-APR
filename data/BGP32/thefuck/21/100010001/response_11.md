## Analysis:
The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. This error is occurring when the `split()` method is being called on `command.script` without checking if the list resulting from the split operation has at least two elements before accessing the index 1.

## Bug:
The bug is caused when the `split()` method is called on `command.script` without verifying the length of the resulting list before accessing the index 1. If the split operation results in a list with only one element, trying to access index 1 will raise an `IndexError`.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` operation does not cause an `IndexError` by first checking the length of the resulting list. We can also add a check to ensure that the first element of the list is equal to 'git'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[0] == 'git' and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This fix includes checking the length of the `words` list before accessing index 1 to prevent the `IndexError`. It also verifies that the first element of the list is equal to 'git' before checking if the second element is 'stash'.
