### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the `.split()[1]` operation is trying to access an index that does not exist in the list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` does not have multiple words to split, resulting in an IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has enough words to split before accessing the desired index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first splitting the `command.script` and checking if it has more than one word, we can prevent the IndexError. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
