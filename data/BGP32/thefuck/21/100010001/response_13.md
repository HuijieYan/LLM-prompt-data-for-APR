### Analysis:
- The `match` function is defined as a decorator `@git_support`, indicating it is meant to be used with Git commands.
- The function checks if the command involves a `git stash` operation and if `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

### Potential Error Location:
- The error occurs in `command.script.split()[1]`, which is trying to access the second element after splitting the command script.
- If the script split does not contain at least 2 elements, an `IndexError` will be raised.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because there might be cases where the script split does not contain at least two elements, and we try to access the second element directly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Before accessing the second element, we need to ensure that the split result contains at least two elements.
- We can use an `if` condition to check the length of the split list before accessing its elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and
            script_split[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, by checking the length of the `script_split` list before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
