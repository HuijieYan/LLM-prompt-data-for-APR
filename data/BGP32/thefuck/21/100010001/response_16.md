## Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a Git command matches the pattern of using `git stash` and having 'usage:' in the stderr.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the message "list index out of range".
- The bug occurs when trying to access the second element of the split command script without proper validation.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug originates from assuming there will always be at least two elements in the split command script, which is not the case for some commands with only the `git` keyword and no additional arguments.

## Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.
- Check if the split command script has enough elements to access the 'stash' keyword.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_elements) >= 2
            and command_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we split the command script and check if the number of elements is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This modification prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.
