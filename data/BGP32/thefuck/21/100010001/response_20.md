### Analyzing the buggy function and error message:

The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a given command matches the criteria for fixing a git stash error. The condition to be met for a match is that the second word in the command script should be 'stash' and the string 'usage:' should be present in the command stderr.

The error message shows that the IndexError occurs when trying to access index 1 of the `split()` method on `command.script`. This means that the `split()` method is being called on an empty script or a script with no spaces, leading to an index out of range error.

### Potential error locations:
1. If the script of the `command` provided does not contain any spaces.
2. If the `command.script` is empty.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always contain multiple words separated by spaces. When this assumption is violated, accessing index 1 of the split result will lead to an index out of range error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to perform additional checks to ensure that the command script is not empty and contains at least two words before trying to access index 1 of the split result.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the command script is not empty and contains at least two words
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the script into parts first and then checking for its length before accessing index 1, we can ensure that the script has enough content to be processed without causing an IndexError.
