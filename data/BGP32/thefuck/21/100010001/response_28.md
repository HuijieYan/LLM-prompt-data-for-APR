### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs due to possible IndexError when trying to split the `command.script` into a list of words and accessing the second word, since there may not be a second word in certain cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access the second word in `command.script` without first checking if the script contains more than one word. This leads to an IndexError when splitting the script into multiple words.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the `command.script` is split into multiple words before trying to access the second word. This can be achieved by checking if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1  # Check if there are at least 2 words in the script
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` into `script_words` first and then checking if it has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
