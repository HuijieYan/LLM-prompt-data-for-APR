### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is occurring within the `match` function.
- The buggy function is trying to split the script of the `command` and then access the second element for comparison without checking if the split results in at least two elements.
- The `IndexError` is likely occurring because the split operation is not always resulting in two or more elements.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function is assuming that splitting the `command.script` will always yield at least two elements, but in certain cases, it may not contain enough elements resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to first check if the split operation actually creates enough elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.
- We should also check if the second element is equal to 'stash', and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we ensure that an `IndexError` will not occur. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
