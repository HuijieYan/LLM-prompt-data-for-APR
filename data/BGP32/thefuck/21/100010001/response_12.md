## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script by spaces and expects the second element to be 'stash'. There are multiple potential error locations in this function:
1. If the command script is empty or doesn't have any spaces, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an IndexError.
2. If the command stderr is empty or does not contain the word 'usage:', the function may also encounter issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function assuming the existence of the second element after splitting the command script by spaces. In the failing test case, the `command.script` is not provided, leading to an empty array after the split operation. Yet, the function attempts to access the second element leading to an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy:
We need to add safety checks to ensure that the command script is not empty and that there are enough elements after splitting by spaces before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we need to verify that the stderr contains 'usage:' before proceeding.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script:
        return False
    
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    if len(script_elements) < 2 or script_elements[1] != 'stash':
        return False
    
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By incorporating these safety checks, the corrected version of the `match` function ensures that it will not encounter an `IndexError` in cases where the command script is empty or does not contain the expected elements.
