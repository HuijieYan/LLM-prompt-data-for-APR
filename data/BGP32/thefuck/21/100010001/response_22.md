## Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is expecting the second word in the `command.script` to be `'stash'`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means the `command.script` is empty or does not have enough elements.
- The buggy function is trying to access the second element of `command.script` directly without checking if the list has enough elements.

## Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not check if the `command.script` has at least 2 words before trying to access the second word.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the length of the `command.script` after splitting is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second word.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the `split_script` has at least 2 elements to avoid IndexError, and then compares the second word with 'stash' for the matching condition.
