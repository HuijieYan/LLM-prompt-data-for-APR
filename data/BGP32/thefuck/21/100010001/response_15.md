## Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` which occurs when trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the list.

## Bug:
The bug occurs because the `command.script` might not have a second word (index 1) when split by spaces, leading to the `IndexError`.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has enough words before accessing index 1 to prevent the `IndexError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` into words and checking if the list has enough elements before accessing the second index, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure the function works correctly.
