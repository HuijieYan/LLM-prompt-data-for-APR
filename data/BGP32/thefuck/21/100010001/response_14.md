## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' text is present in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to the `split()` method being called on an empty list, resulting in a failed index access.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by splitting an empty `command.script` when there are no words in the script, resulting in an empty list. Accessing an index of an empty list raises an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we should first check if the `command.script` has enough words before trying to access the second word. This can be done by checking the length of the split result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before trying to access the second word, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
