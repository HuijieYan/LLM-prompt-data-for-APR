## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to extract the second element from the split command script and compare it with 'stash'. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically stating that the "list index is out of range". This error occurs when trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

## Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring due to the assumption that there will always be at least two elements in the split command script, which may not be the case.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` statement assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting the command script, which does not hold true in all cases. When the split command script has only a single element, trying to access the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and stores the resulting parts in a variable. Then, it checks if there are at least two parts in the split command script before trying to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring and ensures the function works as intended.
