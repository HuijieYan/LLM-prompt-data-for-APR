## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. However, the error message indicates an `IndexError` where the code is trying to access an index that does not exist in the list. This means that `command.script` does not have enough elements splittable by whitespaces resulting in an out-of-range index being accessed.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is `command.script.split()[1]`. If `command.script` does not contain enough whitespace separated elements, accessing the element at index 1 will result in an IndexError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to split by whitespace. In the case of the failing test, the `command` provided does not have a second word when split by whitespaces, resulting in the IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check the length of the splittable elements in `command.script` before accessing index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before attempting to access an element at a specific index.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first split the `command.script` into parts.
2. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 to ensure there are enough elements.
3. Next, we check if the second element (`script_parts[1]`) is 'stash'.
4. Finally, we check if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr.

This corrected version of the function should handle cases where the `command.script` may not have enough whitespace-separated elements, preventing the IndexError.
