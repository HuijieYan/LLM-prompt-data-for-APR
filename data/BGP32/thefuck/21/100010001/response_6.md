### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` by spaces and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. The cause of the error is the assumption that there will always be at least two elements in the split list. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing index `[1]` without checking the length of the split list.
2. Checking for `'usage:' in `command.stderr` might not be sufficient for identifying the specific error condition.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when splitting by spaces. If the `command.script` is empty or contains only one element, it will result in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split list before accessing index `[1]`.
2. Also, consider checking for specific error conditions in the `command.stderr` rather than just searching for `'usage:'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the split list from `command.script` has more than one element before trying to access index `[1]`. If the split list has fewer elements, we return `False`. This prevents the `IndexError`. Additionally, we retain the check for `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` to ensure we are matching the specific error condition.
