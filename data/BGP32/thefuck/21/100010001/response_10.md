## Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, the error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the split operation may not be returning enough elements to index.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when `command.script` does not have enough elements to split. Specifically, if the script has no space-separated elements, splitting it will result in only one element at the index 0.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` can be split before trying to access the second element. We can do this by ensuring that the split operation actually returns enough elements.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly.
