### Analysis:
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` which means that the program is trying to access an index in a list that doesn't exist.
- The buggy function is splitting the `script` attribute of the `command` object but not checking if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1.
- The function is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always contain at least 2 elements when split, which is not always true.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) >= 2:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in a variable `split_command`.
- We then check if the length of `split_command` is at least 2 before accessing index 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.
- If the split list has at least 2 elements, we check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
- If the conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
