1. Analyzing the buggy function and the error message:

The buggy function is named `match` and it is decorated with `@git_support`. It takes a `Command` object as input and checks if the second part (index 1) of the script in the `Command` object is equal to 'stash' and if the stderr of the `Command` object contains the word 'usage:'. The error message states that an IndexError occurred in the line `command.script.split()[1]` which means that the script is empty or does not contain enough words to split by index 1.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error location is in `command.script.split()[1]` where index 1 is accessed without checking if there is actually a second element in the split script.

3. Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by accessing index 1 of the split script without verifying if there are enough elements in the split command script.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script actually contains enough elements before accessing index 1 to avoid the IndexError.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and stores it in the `split_script` variable. Then, it checks if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This modification ensures that the script will not throw an IndexError when trying to access index 1.
