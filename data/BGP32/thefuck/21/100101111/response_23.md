## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs because when the command script is just 'git', the split() method results in only one element in the list, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two words in the command script, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to handle cases where the script has only one word. We can also check the length of the split() result before trying to access index 1 to avoid the IndexError.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split script words before accessing index 1, we ensure that we do not encounter an IndexError. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
