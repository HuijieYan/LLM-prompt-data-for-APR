### Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `match` is intended to check if a Git command is related to stashing based on the script and stderr values. The bug occurs when the `split()` method is called on the script of the command, and the function tries to access the second element of the resulting list without checking if it exists.

### Identify potential error locations

The potential error location in the buggy function is here:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```

### Explain the cause of the bug

In the failing test scenario, the `command.script` is 'git', so when splitting this string, the resulting list will only have one element ('git'). Then, trying to access the second element (index 1) directly without checking will raise an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error is consistent with the GitHub issue description, where the traceback shows the same IndexError when the function is called.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can achieve this by first checking the length of the split list to avoid the IndexError.

### Provide a corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the split list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If there is at least one more element after splitting, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash'. Otherwise, we return `False` to indicate that the conditions were not met. This correction should prevent the IndexError and effectively match the intended criteria.
