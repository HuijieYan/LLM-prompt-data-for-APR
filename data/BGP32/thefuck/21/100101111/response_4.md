### Error Location:
The error occurs in the buggy function `match()` at the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error happens because it assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least 2 elements after splitting, which is not always true.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()[1]` will always have an index of `1` available, leading to an `IndexError` when the split result is empty or has only one element. This results in a failure of the test case because the provided test input does not meet this assumption.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script.split()` has at least 2 elements before checking the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing the element at index `1`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of `splited_script` before trying to access `splited_script[1]`, we avoid the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves correctly.
