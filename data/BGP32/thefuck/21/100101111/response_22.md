In the provided buggy function, the error occurs because the `command.script` is split without checking if it has at least two elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element `[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access the second one. We can do this by checking the length of the split list first.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the script is split properly and does not lead to an `IndexError`. With this fix, the function should now be able to handle cases where the command script does not have enough elements after splitting.
