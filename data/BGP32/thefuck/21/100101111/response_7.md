### Potential error:
The potential error in the buggy function is when trying to access index 1 in the split command.script. If the split command does not result in a list with at least two elements, an IndexError will occur.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the split command.script will always result in a list with at least two elements, hence accessing index 1 without checking the length of the split result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command.script results in a list with at least two elements before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

By implementing the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the split command.script is checked for the appropriate number of elements before accessing index 1, preventing the IndexError that was causing the failing test.
