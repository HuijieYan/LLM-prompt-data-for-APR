### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test is asserting that the function should not match for a specific `Command` instance where 'git' is the only word in `command.script` and contains the usage information in `command.stderr`.
3. From the runtime values, we see that `splited_script` would contain `['git']`, which leads to the following error:
   - `splited_script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is only one element in the list.
4. The cause of the bug is directly related to assuming the existence of the second element in the `splited_script` list without performing a check.
5. To fix the bug, we need to verify that there are at least two elements in `splited_script` before trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and
            splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
