### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the script command starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The failing test is checking the negative scenario, where the command is just 'git' but the stderr contains the 'usage:' message.
2. The bug occurs when trying to access index 1 of the split script command, causing an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'.
3. The failing test specifically tests this scenario where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The buggy function fails to handle this case and raises an `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is enough to access index 1 before comparing it to 'stash'.

### Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This fix checks if the length of the split script command is greater than 1 before comparing with 'stash', avoiding the `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and handle the scenario as expected.
