Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function `match` is expecting the second element in the split `command.script`, which might not always exist. This is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `match` function to check if the split `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here is a corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2 
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of `splitted_script` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
