### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The issue arises from assuming that the `command.script.split()` operation will always contain at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access index `[1]`.

### Cause of the Bug
In the failing test scenario, the `command.script` value is `'git'`, which results in a single-element list after splitting. Therefore, attempting to access index `[1]` leads to an `IndexError`. This behavior does not match the expected logic of the buggy function, resulting in a failed test due to the incorrect assumption of the script structure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access index `[1]`. Additionally, we should ensure that the second element is compared with `'stash'` only when it exists in the list. This adjustment will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and align the function's behavior with the expected logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version of the function first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the split list has at least two elements. It then verifies if the second element is `'stash'` before proceeding with the comparison and checking for `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`.
