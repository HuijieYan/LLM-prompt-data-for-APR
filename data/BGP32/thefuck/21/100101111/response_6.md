### Analysis
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and check if the second element is 'stash'. However, in the failing test scenario, the `command.script` is 'git', so splitting it would result in a list with only one element. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. When the `command.script` is 'git', splitting it results in a list with only one element, causing the function to try accessing an index that does not exist.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` can be split into two or more elements before trying to access the second element. If it cannot be split, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

With this correction, the function first checks if `command.script` can be split into more than one element before trying to access the second index. If split is not possible, it will return `False`.
