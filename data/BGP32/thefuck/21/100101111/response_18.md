## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match a command for the 'git stash' operation based on the presence of a specific string in the stderr output. However, the bug occurs when the command is only 'git' without any additional arguments. In such cases, the split operation on the script parameter creates a list with only one element ('git'), leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 in the list.

This issue was reported on GitHub with a detailed description of the problem and the traceback indicating the IndexError occurring within the match function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If the list has fewer elements, we can return False to indicate that the command does not match for the 'git stash' operation.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) >= 2 and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By incorporating the check for the length of the command_parts list, the corrected version of the function will not throw an IndexError when the command is just 'git'. The function will now properly match the 'git stash' command based on the conditions provided.
