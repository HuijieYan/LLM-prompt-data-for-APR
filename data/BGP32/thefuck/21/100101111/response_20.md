The issue in the buggy function stems from assuming that the script split will always result in a list of at least two elements, hence accessing index 1 directly. However, in cases where the script contains only one element, like 'git', this assumption leads to an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script has more than one element after splitting before accessing index 1. If it does not, the match function should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the function will not encounter an IndexError when trying to access an element at index 1 if the split list contains only one element. It will return False in such cases, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
