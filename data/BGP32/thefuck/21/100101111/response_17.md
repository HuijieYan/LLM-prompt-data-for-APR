## Error Location
The bug is located in the `match` function at the line `command.script.split()[1]`. The issue arises when the `split()` function is applied to a string that does not contain any whitespace, resulting in an empty list. Accessing index 1 of an empty list causes the `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least one space-separated value. In the failing test, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which leads to the attempted access of index 1 in the empty list produced by `split()`. This results in an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `split()` function results in a list with at least two elements before accessing index 1. If the list is empty or has only one element, we should return `False` to indicate that the command does not match the expected pattern.

## Corrected Version of the `match` function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. If the length is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
