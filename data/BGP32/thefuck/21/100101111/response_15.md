### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` takes a `command` object as input and checks if the second element in the `script` attribute is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `stderr` attribute.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` tries to match a `Command` object where the `script` attribute is `'git'` and the `stderr` attribute includes the usage message for `git stash`.
3. The bug occurs because when the `script` attribute has only one element (e.g., `'git'`), attempting to access the second element via index `[1]` results in a `list index out of range` error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `script` is enough to access the second element before comparing it to `'stash'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to check if the length of `splited_script` after splitting the `script` is sufficient before accessing the second element and comparing it to `'stash'`.
2. If the length is sufficient, proceed with the existing comparison logic. Otherwise, return False.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) > 1:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By implementing this logic, we ensure that the function avoids trying to access an index that is out of range and returns False if the `script` does not contain the necessary elements for comparison.
