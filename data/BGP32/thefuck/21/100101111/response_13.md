### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is encountering an `IndexError` when trying to split the script by space because when the script is just 'git', there is no second word to access.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second word in the script, which is not the case when the script is only 'git'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the condition to also check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before checking the second word.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and
            splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the split script before accessing the second word, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and not encounter the issue posted on GitHub.
