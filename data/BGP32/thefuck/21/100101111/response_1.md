## Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in `command.stderr`. The failing test provides input where `command.script` is 'git' and `command.stderr` includes 'usage:' string, causing the buggy function to raise an `IndexError`.

## Bug
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is being split into a list, but there is no check to ensure that `command.script` contains more than one word before accessing the second element in the list. This results in a `list index out of range` error when trying to access the second element of a single-word script.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` can be split into multiple words before trying to access the second word. If the script cannot be split, we can assume that it is not a valid command and return `False`. 

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding the check for the length of the `splited_script` list before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function behaves correctly for all inputs.
