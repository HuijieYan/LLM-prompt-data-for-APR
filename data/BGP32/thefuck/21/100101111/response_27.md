### Potential Error Locations
1. The function is splitting the `command.script` by whitespaces, which might lead to an IndexError if the `command.script` does not have multiple parts.
2. The comparison is checking if the second part of the split script is equal to `'stash'`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when the command script is just `'git'`, splitting it by whitespaces results in a list with only one element ('git'), leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element for comparison with 'stash'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element for comparison.
- Modify the comparison condition to check if the first part of the split script is equal to 'git' and the second part is equal to 'stash'.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return split_script[0] == 'git' and split_script[1] == 'stash'
    return False
```

By checking the length of the split script before comparing elements, we prevent the IndexError and correctly match the command when it starts with 'git' and has 'stash' as the second part.
