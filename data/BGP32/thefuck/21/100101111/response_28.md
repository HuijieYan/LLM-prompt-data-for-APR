## Correction:

After analyzing the code and the failing test case, it appears that the bug is triggered by trying to access the second element of the split command.script without first checking if it exists. This results in an IndexError when the script is "git" and split results in a list with only one element.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split command results in at least two parts before attempting to access the second part. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking for the minimum length of `splited_script` to be at least 2 before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub.
