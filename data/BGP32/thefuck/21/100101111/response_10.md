### Issue Analysis:
- The function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` is supposed to check if the given command is related to `git stash` and if the error message contains `'usage:'`.
- The bug occurs when the `split()` method is called on `command.script` without checking if it has at least two elements in the resulting list.
- This bug leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list produced by `split()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Before accessing the second element of the split command, we need to make sure that the split actually contains more than one element to avoid the `IndexError`.
- We can achieve this by first checking the length of the split command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version includes a check for the length of the split script before trying to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` that was causing the tests to fail.
