### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the match function to return `False`. However, based on the provided input values, the function is encountering an `IndexError`.
3. The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two words, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in cases where the script contains only one word.
4. A potential strategy to fix the bug is to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in a variable `split_script`. Then, we check if the length of `split_script` is at least 2 before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`. This modification ensures that the function can handle cases where the script contains only one word.
