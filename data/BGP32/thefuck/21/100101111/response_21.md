## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the script in the `command` is `'git stash'` and if the stderr contains the phrase `'usage:'`.
2. The buggy function splits the script by spaces and tries to access the second element of the split list, which is causing an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the `match` function to return `False` when provided with a `Command` object with `script` as `'git'` and relevant `stderr`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates the same issue of `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second element in the split script, leading to an `IndexError` when the script is not in the expected format.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to check if the split script contains `'stash'` rather than directly accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and ensure correct behavior in all cases.

## Updated Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly identify when the script contains `'stash'` and the stderr contains `'usage:'`, fixing the `IndexError` issue and passing the failing test.
