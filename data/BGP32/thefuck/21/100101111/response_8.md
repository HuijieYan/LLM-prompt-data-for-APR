### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` takes a `Command` object as input and checks if the second element of the script split by whitespace is equal to `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in the `stderr` attribute.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects that when the command script is just `'git'`, the function should not match, but due to a potential index error in the function, it fails.
3. The function fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element of the split script in cases where the script contains only one element (e.g., `'git'`).
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the script has fewer elements than expected and update the function to return `False` in such cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element.
2. If the length is less than 2, return `False`.
3. Update the function to handle this edge case and ensure it returns `False` when needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making these adjustments, the function will now handle cases where the script has only one element and return `False` to not match in such scenarios, which resolves the `IndexError` issue.
