The issue with the buggy function is that it assumes `command.script` contains at least two elements (splitting by spaces) without checking its length. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element when it does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function checks for the length of the `splited_script` list before accessing the second element. If it contains at least two elements, it checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` and works as expected based on the provided test case and expected values.
