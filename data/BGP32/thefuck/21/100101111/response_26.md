### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script` split by spaces is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` contains only one element, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element from the split list.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with `script` set to 'git' and `stderr` containing the usage information for the 'git stash' command. Since the `command.script.split()` in the buggy function returns `['git']`, trying to access index 1 leads to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If the split result doesn't have enough elements, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By incorporating the check for the split length in the corrected code above, the `IndexError` issue should be resolved, and the function will return `False` when the split result is insufficient, ensuring that the failing test will now pass.
