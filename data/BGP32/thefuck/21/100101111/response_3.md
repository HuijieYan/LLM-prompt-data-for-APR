## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter has at least two elements after splitting. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when accessing the second element in cases where there is only one element.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter contains at least two elements after splitting before trying to access the second element.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By modifying the function to check the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly.
