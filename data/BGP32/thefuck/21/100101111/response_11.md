## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the script of the command is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. The bug occurs when the script of the command has only one word, as it tries to access the second word causing an `IndexError`.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` where `split()[1]` can raise an `IndexError` when the script has only one word.

## Bug Cause
The failing test case is providing the `Command` object with script as `'git'` and stderr containing the usage information. Since the script is a single word, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` leading to the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should first check if the script contains at least two words before accessing the second word. We can modify the condition to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second word.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

After applying this fix, the function will first check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script has only one word.
