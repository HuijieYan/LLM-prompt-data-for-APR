### Potential issues:
1. The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`, which can lead to an `IndexError` if there are not enough words in the script.
2. The buggy function is checking for the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`, which is case-sensitive and may not match due to variations in the string content.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is failing due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the `command.script`. This error occurs because the `command.script` does not contain enough words, causing the `split()` method to return a list with fewer elements than expected. Additionally, the function may fail to find `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` due to case-sensitive mismatches.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word to prevent the `IndexError`.
2. Use a case-insensitive search to check for the presence of `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr` to ensure matching regardless of case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1].lower() == 'stash' \
           and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower()
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if there are at least two words in the `command.script` before accessing the second word. It also converts both the `command.stderr` and the search string `'usage:'` to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
