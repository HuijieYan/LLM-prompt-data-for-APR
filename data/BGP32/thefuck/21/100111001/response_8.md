### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute by whitespaces and then check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` value is `'git'`, which does not have a second element when split. This leads to an `IndexError` since there is no element at index 1 after splitting.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains the word `'stash'` before attempting to split it. If it does not contain `'stash'`, we should return `False` immediately.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' not in command.script:
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first verify if `'stash'` is present in the `command.script` before trying to split it. If `'stash'` is not in `command.script`, it will return `False` directly, preventing the `IndexError` that occurred in the original buggy function.
