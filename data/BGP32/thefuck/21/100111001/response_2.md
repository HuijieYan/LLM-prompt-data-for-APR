### Analysis
- The `match` function is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if there is an error message indicating incorrect usage.
- The bug seems to be related to the assumption that there will always be a valid command after splitting `command.script`. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause
- When the script is split by whitespace, if there is no second element (index 1), trying to access it directly will result in an `IndexError`.
- In this case, the input parameter `command.script` is just `'git'`, so splitting it will result in a single element list, causing the error when trying to access index 1.

### Fix
- To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split command before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying the fix above, the corrected function should handle cases where the command script does not contain enough elements after splitting. This should address the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly.
