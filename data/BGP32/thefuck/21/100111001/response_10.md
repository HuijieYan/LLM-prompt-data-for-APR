### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script using whitespace and then checking if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the command script only contains `'git'`, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

### Bug
The bug in the function `match` is due to assuming there will always be a second element in the split command script.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before checking if the second element is `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the split command script has at least two elements before checking if the second element is `'stash'`.
