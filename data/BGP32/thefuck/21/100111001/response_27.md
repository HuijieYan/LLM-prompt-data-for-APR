### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs because the `command.script` does not contain a second word due to the space splitting logic, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the split list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have at least two words where the second word is `'stash'`. In the failing test case, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, so attempting to access index 1 of a single-word script leads to an IndexError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script list before accessing index 1. We also need to make sure that the second word is `'stash'` and that `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking the length of `script_parts`, we ensure we don't run into an IndexError when accessing index 1. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
