The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when trying to split `command.script` into a list and accessing the second element, resulting in an IndexError since the list might not have an element at index 1.

The strategy to fix this bug is to first check if `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if there are at least two words in the `command.script` before comparing the second word to 'stash'. This modification should prevent the IndexError and allow the function to work as intended.
