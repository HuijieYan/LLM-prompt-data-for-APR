### Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. The error occurs because the split command does not return enough elements to access the second one.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command returns at least two elements before trying to access the second one. This can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
