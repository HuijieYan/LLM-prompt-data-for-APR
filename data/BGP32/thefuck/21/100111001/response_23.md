### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr output contains the word "usage:". The issue causing the failing test is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This leads to an IndexError when the command script does not contain multiple words.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the split command script will always have more than one element, which leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element. In this case, the command script only contains a single element, causing the issue.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError and allow the function to execute correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By modifying the function to first check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
