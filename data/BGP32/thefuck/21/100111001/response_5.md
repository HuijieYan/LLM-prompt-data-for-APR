### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` on `command.script.split()[1]`, meaning that `split()` does not provide any elements to access at index 1, indicating that the `command.script` does not contain enough words to split into.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function assumes there will always be at least two words in `command.script` after splitting it. However, in this case, `command.script` only contains one word ('git'). This leads to the `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 after splitting.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script` has enough words to be split before accessing index 1. If not, it means the command is not related to 'stash', so the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `words` before trying to access index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly.
