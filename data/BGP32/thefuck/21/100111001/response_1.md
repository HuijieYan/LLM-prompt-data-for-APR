### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second element of the command script is 'stash' and if the command stderr contains 'usage:'. The error occurs when trying to split the command script because it may not have enough elements, leading to an IndexError.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always have at least two elements when splitting it to compare with 'stash'.

### Fix
We need to first check if the command script has enough elements before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should ensure that 'stash' is the second element before proceeding with the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
