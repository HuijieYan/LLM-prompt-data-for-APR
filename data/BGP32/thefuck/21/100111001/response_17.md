### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the function not to match when the script is `'git'` and the stderr contains stash-related information.

The error occurs when trying to split the script in the command. Since the script is only `'git'`, splitting it by spaces results in a list with one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be a second word in the command script without proper validation, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script has more than one word before trying to access the second word. If not, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) <= 1:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
