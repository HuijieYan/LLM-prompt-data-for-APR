### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the command script by whitespace and check if the second element is 'stash' while also looking for 'usage:' in the command's stderr.
- The failing test `test_not_match` expects the buggy function to return `False` when given a command with stderr containing 'usage:' but where the script does not have 'stash' as the second element.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, meaning that the split operation on `command.script` does not have a second element, causing an issue when trying to access it.
- Based on the provided runtime values, the `command.script` has only one element ('git'), so splitting it by whitespace will only result in one element, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `command.script` is being split by whitespace, but the expected 'stash' keyword is not found at the second index due to the lack of multiple elements after splitting.

### Fix:
Adjust the logic to check if 'stash' is present in the split command script and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr separately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that 'stash' is present in the command script and 'usage:' is present in the stderr independently, fixing the IndexError issue.
