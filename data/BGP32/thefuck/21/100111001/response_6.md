### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which leads to an 'IndexError' since calling `split()` on it generates an empty list, causing the list index to be out of range.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before accessing the second word. Also, we need to ensure that the `command.stderr` is not empty before checking for the presence of 'usage:' in it.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle cases where the `command.script` may not contain the expected word 'stash' or where the `command.stderr` may be empty.
