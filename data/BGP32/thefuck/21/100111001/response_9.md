### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` parameter and then access the second part to compare it with `'stash'`. However, the bug occurs when `command.script` does not have a second part, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By incorporating the check for the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, the corrected version of the function should now handle the input correctly and pass the failing test.
