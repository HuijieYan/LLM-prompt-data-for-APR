### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The bug is occurring because the `split()` method on `command.script` is causing an IndexError when the script does not contain multiple words.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` always contains multiple words and trying to access the second word using `split()[1]`. When the script is just 'git', `split()` will result in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains the word 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr` without relying on indexing. We can achieve this by splitting the script into words and checking each word individually.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By using `in` to check if 'stash' is one of the words in `command.script.split()`, we avoid the IndexError. This will correctly determine if the script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
