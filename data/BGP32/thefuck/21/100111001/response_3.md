### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute and retrieve the second element to check if it is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` value is just `'git'`, causing the function to raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming the `command.script` always contains the keyword `'stash'` at index 1, which leads to an `IndexError` when this assumption is incorrect, as in the failing test case.

### Fix
We need to first check if `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. We should also ensure that `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` and ensuring that it has at least two elements, we can prevent the `IndexError`.
