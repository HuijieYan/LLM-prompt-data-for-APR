### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script indicates a Git stash operation and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to verify that the match function returns false for a specific Command object representing a `git` command with stderr related to Git stash.
- The error message highlights an `IndexError` indicating that a list index is out of range in the buggy function.
- The runtime values show that the `command.script` does not contain the word 'stash', leading to the IndexError when trying to split the script.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that the second word in the command script is always 'stash' without verifying it, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting the script.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if the command script has at least two words before attempting to access the second word as 'stash'.
- This can be achieved by splitting the script and checking if the split result is longer than 1 before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version, the script is split first, and then it is checked if there are more than 1 word in the split result before accessing the second word for comparison. This modification ensures that an IndexError does not occur when accessing the second element of the split script.
