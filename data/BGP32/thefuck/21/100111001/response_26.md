### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash by looking for the keyword 'stash' in the command script and 'usage:' in the command stderr. However, the buggy function is causing an `IndexError` because it attempts to split the command script without performing a check for its length. This leads to the error when the script has no additional arguments after 'git', resulting in an empty list after splitting.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always have multiple elements when split by whitespaces. In this case, when the script is only 'git', splitting it results in a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has enough elements to access index 1. If not, the function should return False.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the function does not encounter an `IndexError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
