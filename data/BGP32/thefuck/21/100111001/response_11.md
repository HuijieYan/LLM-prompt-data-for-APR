### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `script` attribute from the `command` argument and access the second element (index 1) to compare it with `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which means splitting it will result in a list of size 1. Accessing index 1 of a list with only one element causes an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing index 1. This way, we avoid indexing errors when the command script is not as expected.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

The corrected version first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the split list has more than one element before accessing the second element to compare with `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` in cases where the script doesn't contain enough parts.
