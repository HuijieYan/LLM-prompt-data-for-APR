### Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is failing with an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs because the function is trying to access the second element of the split command, which may not exist in all cases.

The function splits the `command.script` using whitespaces and tries to access the second element to check if it equals 'stash'. However, in cases where the `command.script` doesn't have multiple elements, this will raise an IndexError.

### Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should also check if the `command.script` exists to avoid similar issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By performing these checks, we ensure that the function will not raise an IndexError and will correctly match the command when the conditions are met.
