### Explanation
The `IndexError: list index out of range` error occurs because the `command.script.split()` attempt to access the second element of the split list, assuming it exists, but in this case, the `command.script` variable does not contain a space-separated list with at least two elements, leading to the IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has enough elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the IndexError. We should also ensure that the check for `'stash'` in the command occurs before attempting to split the `command.script`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) >= 2
            and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `command_parts` to ensure it has at least 2 elements before accessing the element at index 1, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.
