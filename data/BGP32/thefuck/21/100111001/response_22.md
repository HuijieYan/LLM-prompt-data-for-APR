### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` only consists of 'git' without the 'stash', leading to an `IndexError` when trying to split the script and access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains the word 'stash' before trying to split the script to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking if the length of `words` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` and make the function more robust.
