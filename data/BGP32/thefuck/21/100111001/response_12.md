### Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the buggy function is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` where `command.script` is assumed to contain at least one element after splitting by whitespace (space). The error occurs when `command.script` is empty or has only one element, causing an `IndexError` in the split operation.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that splitting `command.script` by whitespace will always result in at least two elements, and it directly accesses the second element (`[1]`) in the list without checking if it exists. In the failing test, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in a single element list after splitting, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` may not have multiple elements after splitting. We can add a condition to check if the split result contains at least two elements before trying to access the element at index 1.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if `len(script_parts) >= 2` before accessing `script_parts[1]`, we ensure that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` when the `command.script` does not contain enough elements after splitting. This fix will enable the function to correctly identify the command as related to `'stash'` and handle the case where there is additional text in the stderr.
