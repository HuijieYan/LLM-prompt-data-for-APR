### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is failing because it tries to access the second element of the split command script (`command.script.split()[1]`) without checking if there are at least two elements in the split result. This leads to an `IndexError` when the split result only contains one element (or fewer).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `match` function to first check if the split result contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will now first check if the split result contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
