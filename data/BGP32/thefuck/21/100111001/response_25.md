### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the buggy implementation doesn't consider cases where the command script doesn't have more than one word, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes the command script always contains at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script has enough words before attempting to access the second word. We can also add a check to ensure that the second word is 'stash'.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the command script into words and checks if there are more than one word before comparing the second word to 'stash'.
