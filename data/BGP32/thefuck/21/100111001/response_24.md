### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` but assumes it has at least two elements without checking its length. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element. The failing test provides a `Command` object with `script='git'`, which causes the function to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes `command.script` will always have at least two elements (indexing with `[1]`) without verifying it. This assumption leads to an error when trying to access the second element of a one-element list.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split result before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Updated Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts`, we ensure that accessing `script_parts[1]` is safe. Now, the function should handle the Command object provided in the failing test correctly.
