### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs when accessing the second element of the split `command.script` if it does not have enough elements. This leads to an `IndexError` because the split list might be empty or have only one element. The failing test provides an `IndexError` due to this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split list from `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second one. We can also check if 'stash' is actually present in the split list to avoid indexing errors.

### Correction
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and 'stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking if the split list has more than one element and ensuring that 'stash' is in the split list before processing further, the corrected version prevents the `IndexError`.
