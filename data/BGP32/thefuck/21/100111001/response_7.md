### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is throwing an `IndexError` because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if there are enough elements in the split result. This error occurs because in the failing test, the `command.script` only contains a single element (`git`) after splitting, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the non-existing second element to compare it with `'stash'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the command script into parts and then checks if there are at least two elements before accessing the second element to compare it with `'stash'`.
