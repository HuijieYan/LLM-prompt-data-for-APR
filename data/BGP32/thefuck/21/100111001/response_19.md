### Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is checking the second word in the `command.script` to be `'stash'`, which is causing an `IndexError` when the script does not contain enough words. In this case, the script is simply `'git'`, so splitting it and accessing the second element leads to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `command.script` contains more than one word before trying to access the second word to avoid `IndexError`.
2. Update the conditional check to also consider whether 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of `script_words`, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the condition includes checking 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
