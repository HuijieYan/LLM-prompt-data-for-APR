### Analysis
The `IndexError` in the buggy function is likely caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` operation when `command.script` does not contain multiple words. In this case, splitting the string by whitespace and accessing the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains multiple words before trying to access the second word. If it does not, the function should return `False`.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
