### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison of the second part of the split script with 'stash' instead of matching the whole split script.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` in the `match` function. In the failing test, the `command.script` is `'git'`, and when split, it becomes `['git']`. The comparison is checking if the second element of the split script is equal to 'stash', which will always be False, resulting in a mismatch.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to compare the entire `command.script` after splitting with 'stash' to correctly identify if the command is related to git stash.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
