### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the second word in the command script with 'stash'. To fix this, we should check the first word in the script instead of the second word.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
