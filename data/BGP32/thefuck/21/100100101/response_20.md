### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the condition in the return statement is checking for the second element of the split script which might not always be 'stash'.

### Potential Error
The bug in the function lies in the comparison `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')`. This will always look for the second word after splitting the script, which might not be 'stash'.

### Cause of the Bug
In the failing test case, the `Command` object has the script as 'git', so when the function splits it, the second element is not 'stash'. Hence, the condition fails and the function returns False.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' is in the script instead of comparing it to the second element. This will make the function more flexible and accurate in detecting the 'stash' command.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
