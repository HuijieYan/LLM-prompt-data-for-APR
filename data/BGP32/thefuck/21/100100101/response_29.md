### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is `'git'` and the stderr contains the usage information for git stash commands, which should actually trigger a match according to the current implementation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the command script contains 'git' and if the stderr contains the usage information for git stash commands.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in splited_script
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making the above change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and correctly match when the stderr contains the git stash usage information.
