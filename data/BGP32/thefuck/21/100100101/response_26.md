### Analysis
1. The `match` function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
2. The buggy function fails to handle multiple spaces in the stderr check, which causes it to not match the condition correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to match the command with multiple spaces in the stderr, leading to a false negative match result.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the matching condition to handle multiple spaces in the stderr check.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in " ".join(command.stderr.split()))
``` 

After applying this correction, the function should now correctly match the test case provided.
