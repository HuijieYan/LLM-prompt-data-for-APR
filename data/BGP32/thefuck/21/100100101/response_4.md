The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The bug in this function is that it does not take into account the case where 'stash' is not the second word in the script, leading to incorrect matching.

To fix this bug, we should check if 'stash' is one of the words in the script instead of just being the second word. Additionally, we need to ensure that 'usage:' is in the stderr for a match.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()

    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version uses the 'in' operator to check if 'stash' is present in the script words list, and it checks if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. This way, the function will correctly identify when the command is related to git stash even if 'stash' is not the second word in the script.
