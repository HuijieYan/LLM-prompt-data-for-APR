### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stdout contains 'usage:'. However, in the failing test, the command script is `'git'` and the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. This doesn't match the condition in the buggy function, causing it to fail.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to handle cases where the command script does not have 'stash' as the second word, leading to incorrect matching.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition in the `match` function to check if 'stash' is in the split command script and if 'usage:' is present in the error message. This modification will address the incorrect matching issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this change in the condition, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
