### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the script of the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, it is not correctly handling the case where the command script does not contain the word 'stash'. This is causing the function to fail when the test is expecting a non-match.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the `Command` object is instantiated with `script="git"`, which does not contain the word 'stash'. The buggy function incorrectly matches this case because it only checks for the presence of 'stash' in the script without verifying its position. This leads to a false positive match when it should not match.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to handle cases where the script does not contain 'stash'. We can achieve this by first checking if the script splits into multiple parts before trying to access the second part.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    try:
        splited_script = command.script.split()
        return (len(splited_script) > 1
                and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except IndexError:
        return False
``` 

The corrected version of the function first splits the script into parts and then checks if the length is greater than 1 before accessing the second part to avoid an IndexError. This modification ensures that the function only matches commands where the second word in the script is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr.
