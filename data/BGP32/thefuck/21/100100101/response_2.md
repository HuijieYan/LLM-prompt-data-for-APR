### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to Git stash by looking for the keyword "stash" and checking if the command's stderr contains the text "usage:". However, the current implementation is splitting the script by whitespace and checking the second element, which may not always be 'stash'. This can lead to incorrect matching.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the command `Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err)` does not contain the keyword "stash" in the script, so it should not match. However, the buggy function fails to handle this correctly and erroneously matches it.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We should modify the logic in the `match` function to specifically check if the script starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. This approach would ensure a more accurate match for Git stash-related commands.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
