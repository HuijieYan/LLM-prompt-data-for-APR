The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the second element in the split command script to be 'stash', but it should be checking for the first element. This is causing the function to incorrectly return False when it should return True.

To fix this bug, we need to update the indexing in the condition to check the first element after splitting the script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify the command as a git stash command and return True for the failing test case provided.
