The buggy function `match` is expected to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, the current implementation does not split the command script properly to check the second word.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug lies in the `return` statement of the `match` function where it checks `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This will throw an `IndexError` if the script does not contain multiple words, leading to a failure in the condition check.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to ensure that the script is split correctly before accessing the second word to prevent the `IndexError`. We should also check if the split script has at least two words before proceeding with the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting the script first and checking the length of the split result before accessing the second word, we prevent potential IndexError and properly check if the command script contains 'stash' as the second word and 'usage:' in the stderr as expected.
