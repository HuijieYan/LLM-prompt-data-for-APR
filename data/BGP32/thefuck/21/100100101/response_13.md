### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, the test case is passing a `Command` object with only 'git' as the script and `git_stash_err` in `stderr`. The `stderr` does contain 'usage:', but the script doesn't have 'stash', leading to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not handling scenarios where the command.script does not contain 'stash'.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if 'stash' exists in the `command.script` before checking 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. This adjustment will ensure that the function only returns `True` when both conditions are met.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
