### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script.split()` is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, the command script is only 'git' without any reference to 'stash', but the `command.stderr` contains the usage information related to the `git stash` command. This leads to the function incorrectly returning True when it should be returning False.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should check if 'stash' is included in the command script and also ensure that the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After making this correction, the function should correctly identify if the command is related to `git stash` based on the presence of 'stash' in the command script and the 'usage:' string in the `command.stderr`. This will ensure that the function passes the failing test case and acts as expected.
