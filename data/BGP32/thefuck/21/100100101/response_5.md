The bug in the current `match()` function lies in the condition check where it tries to split the command script and compare the second part with 'stash'. This approach is not robust as it assumes the second element of the split list will always correspond to the command name.

The bug causes the function to fail the test because the actual behavior of the function does not match the expected behavior. In the failing test case, the function is expected to not match the command "git" with a stderr message related to `git stash`, but due to the bug, it incorrectly matches the command.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to properly check if the command script contains 'git stash' and the 'usage:' message in the error output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the function correctly identifies commands related to 'git stash' and the presence of the 'usage:' message in the error output. It should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
