The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is `'git'` and the stderr contains the expected usage message for `git stash`. This results in the function returning True incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should update the function to check if both 'git' and 'stash' appear in the command script and 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_parts and 'stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version will correctly identify the command as 'git stash' based on both 'git' and 'stash' appearing in the script, and verify the presence of the correct usage message in stderr.
