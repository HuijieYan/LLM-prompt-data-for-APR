### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. If both conditions are met, it returns True indicating a match.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the entire stderr string rather than just at the beginning. This causes the function to incorrectly match even when 'usage:' is present in the middle of the stderr.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should check if 'usage:' is present at the beginning of the stderr, rather than anywhere in the string.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr.strip().startswith('usage:'))
```
