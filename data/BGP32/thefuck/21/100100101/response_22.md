### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is intended to match Git commands related to stashing, but there is an issue with the comparison logic in the return statement. The condition checks if the second element in the split command script is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test provided, the command script is 'git', which does not match the condition, leading to a failure.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the buggy function expecting the command script to start with 'git stash', but in the failing test, the command script is just 'git'.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition inside the match function to correctly check if 'stash' is present in the command script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By using 'stash' in split_script instead of comparing the second element directly, we can match the 'git stash' command properly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
