### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage information related to stash. This causes the function to incorrectly match the command.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the condition `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. Since the command script is 'git', the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` evaluates to false, which is correct. However, this condition being satisfied along with the 'usage:' in command.stderr being present causes the function to incorrectly return True.

### Fix Strategy
We need to modify the condition in the function `match` so that it only matches if the script is 'git stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr. We can achieve this by checking if the script starts with 'git stash' instead of specifically checking the second word in the script.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
