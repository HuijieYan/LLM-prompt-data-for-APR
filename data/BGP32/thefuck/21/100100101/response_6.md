The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the test case provided does not match these conditions as the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains the stash commands. The buggy function will return True incorrectly for this case.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the conditions in the `match` function to correctly identify when the command is related to git stash.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check if the word 'stash' is present in the script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr, which aligns with the expected behavior for git stash commands.
