### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The test case `test_not_match` expects the function to return False if the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage message related to 'git stash'.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is incorrectly checking for 'stash' in the second word of the command script, which does not match the test case where the command script is 'git'. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual results.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to correctly check if 'stash' is in the command script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly match when 'stash' is present in the command script and 'usage:' is in the stderr, as expected by the failing test case.
