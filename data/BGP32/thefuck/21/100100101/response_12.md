### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to Git stash by looking for the string 'stash' in the command and checking if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it splits the command script by spaces and directly compares the second element to 'stash', which is an issue when the command does not have multiple parts separated by spaces.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the command script is simply 'git', so when split by spaces, there is no second element to compare to 'stash'. This leads to an IndexError in the buggy function, causing it to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should check if 'stash' is in the command script as a whole instead of splitting the script and comparing only specific parts. Additionally, we need to properly check if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
