The bug in the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of the substring 'usage:' in the entire command's stderr, which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is related to stash in git. The function should check if the command starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr is indicating an error related to stash.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the command starts with 'git stash'.
2. Check if the stderr indicates an error related to stash by looking for the keyword 'stash'.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'stash' in command.stderr.lower())
``` 

This corrected version of the function will correctly check if the command is related to stash in git based on the conditions outlined above.
