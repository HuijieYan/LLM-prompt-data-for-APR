### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the test case provided does not include the word 'stash' in the command. This causes the function to fail since it requires the word 'stash' to be present.

### Bug
The buggy function assumes the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is not always the case. This assumption leads to a false negative when the word 'stash' is not present in the command.

### Fix
Modify the buggy function to check if 'stash' is present in the command script and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, without relying on the word position in the script.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
