### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. This logic is not correctly identifying when a command is related to `git stash`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition assumes that `'stash'` is the second word in the script, but it might not always be the case. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we should check if `'stash'` is present in the script instead of assuming its position. Additionally, we should check if the script starts with `'git'` and contains `'stash'`.  

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_words and 'stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This correction will check if both `'git'` and `'stash'` are present in the script and if `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`, which aligns with the expected behavior for a git stash command.
