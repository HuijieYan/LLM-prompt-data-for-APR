### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command input is related to `git stash` based on the script and stderr information. However, the bug occurs because the function is checking for the presence of `'usage:'` in the entire `stderr` string, which may lead to false positives.

### Potential Error Location
The error lies in the condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr`, where it might mistakenly match any occurrence of `'usage:'` in the `stderr` string.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the command script is `'git'` and the `stderr` contains the expected usage information for `git stash`, which should trigger a match. However, the buggy function incorrectly matches any occurrence of `'usage:'` in the `stderr` instead of specifically checking if it is related to `git stash`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the script contains `'stash'` and if the `stderr` specifically mentions the usage for `git stash`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts 
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this correction, the function will correctly match only when the script contains 'stash' and the stderr contains the usage information specific to `git stash`.
