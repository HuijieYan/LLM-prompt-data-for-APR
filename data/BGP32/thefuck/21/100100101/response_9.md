The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. The bug in the current implementation is that it splits the command script using spaces and checks the second element (index 1) without considering the possible presence of additional arguments.

### Bug:
The bug is that the function assumes the second element of the split script is always the subcommand ('stash'), which results in incorrect matching.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to properly check if 'stash' is present in the command script without relying on positional indexing.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is present in the command script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr, which is a more robust way of determining the match condition.
