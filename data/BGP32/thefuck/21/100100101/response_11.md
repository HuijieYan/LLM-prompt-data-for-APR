### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the command `stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, as it is only checking the second element of the `split` result while it should be checking the first element.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, where it is incorrectly checking the second element of the split script instead of the first. This causes the function to fail to identify commands related to `git stash`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison to check if the first element of the split script is equal to `'stash'`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
