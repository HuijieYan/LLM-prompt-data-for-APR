### Bug Explanation: 
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the `script` attribute of the `Command` object passed in always contains at least two elements when using `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in this case, the `script` attribute only contains one element ('git'), causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `script` attribute contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly in cases where the `script` attribute contains only one element. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
