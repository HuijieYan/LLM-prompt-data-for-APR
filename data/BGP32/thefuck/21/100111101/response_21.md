### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command executed is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. However, the buggy condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is causing an `IndexError` because the split operation on `command.script` doesn't have the expected number of elements.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when provided with a `Command` instance related to git stash, and the stderr contains the usage message.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` condition of the `match` function. It assumes that splitting the `command.script` will always result in at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` when this assumption is not met.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the first element of the split result matches 'git' and if 'stash' is present in the `command.script`.

### Updated Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script.split() and 'stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By updating the condition to check if 'git' is in the split result and 'stash' is in the script itself, we can avoid the `IndexError` and correctly identify commands related to `git stash`.

This fix should address the bug and make the `match` function behave as expected in the failing test scenario.
