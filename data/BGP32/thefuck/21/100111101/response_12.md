The bug in the provided function is due to the assumption that the command.script will always have at least two elements after splitting. However, in the failing test case, the command.script only has one element ('git'), which causes an "IndexError" when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command.script has at least two elements after splitting before trying to access index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of `splited_script` is at least 2 before accessing index 1 to compare with 'stash'.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case and meet the expected input/output values.
