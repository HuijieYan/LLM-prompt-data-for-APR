### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when trying to split the `command.script` string and accessing the second word using index 1. The error message indicates an `IndexError` because there are not enough words in the command script to access index 1.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have multiple words, hence split operation can access index 1. In this specific case, the `command.script` only contains the word `'git'`, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where `command.script` does not have enough words to split. We should first check if the split operation is possible before accessing index 1.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By splitting the `command.script` first and then checking if the split result has enough words before accessing index 1, we can ensure that the function does not throw an `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
