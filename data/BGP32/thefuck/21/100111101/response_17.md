The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the command entered is related to git stash based on the presence of the word "stash" in the script and the occurrence of "usage:" in the standard error output. However, the bug occurs when `command.script` does not have enough elements to split and access the element at index 1, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. If not, then we can safely return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version will first check whether the split command has at least 2 elements. If not, it will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
