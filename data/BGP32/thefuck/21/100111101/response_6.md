The cause of the bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split script without checking if it exists. This leads to an IndexError when the script does not have a second element.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the script and then checks if it has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This modification should fix the IndexError issue and make the function work as expected.
