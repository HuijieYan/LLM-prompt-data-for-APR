## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function arises from assuming that the `command.script` attribute will always contain the command itself followed by the subcommand. However, in this case, the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object contains the full usage message for the `git stash` command, which does not match the split command script.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition within the `match` function to check if the command script starts with 'git' and contains 'stash' somewhere within it. This will ensure that we are correctly identifying the 'git stash' command regardless of the full usage message in the stderr.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git') and 'stash' in command.script
``` 

By making this change, the `match` function will correctly identify the 'git stash' command based on the command script itself, rather than relying on specific positions within the split command script.
