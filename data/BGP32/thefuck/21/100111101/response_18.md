### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and the error message contains the string 'usage:'. However, the buggy implementation is causing an `IndexError` due to trying to access index 1 of the split script without checking its length.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the function not to match a command that is not related to git stash.
3. The error message shows that the IndexError occurs at line 8 in the `match` function due to the list index being out of range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing index 1.

### Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should now handle cases where the length of the split script is less than 2, preventing the IndexError. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
