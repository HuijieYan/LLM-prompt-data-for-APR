### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking whether the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The issue arises when the script has only one word, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word using `split()[1]`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can also simplify the condition by checking if 'stash' is in the script directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the script into words and then checks if 'stash' is one of the words in the script. If it is, and 'usage:' is present in the stderr, the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.
