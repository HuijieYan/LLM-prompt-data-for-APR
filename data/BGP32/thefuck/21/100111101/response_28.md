### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.
3. The failing test provides a `Command` object with `command.script` as 'git' and `command.stderr` containing the output of a 'git stash' command, which includes the usage information.
4. The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()` attempt fails due to an empty `command.script`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` is not empty before splitting it.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check to ensure that `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word, we can fix the bug and prevent the IndexError.
