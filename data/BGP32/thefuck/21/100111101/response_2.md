### Analysis
- The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the second word in the command script and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. 
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the `split()` method is being called on an empty string.
- The command.stderr provided in the failing test includes the usage information for `git stash`, but there are multiple newlines and spaces before the actual usage text. This may cause issues with splitting the script.
- The buggy function is not handling cases where the command script may not have multiple words, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is split properly and handle cases where the split result may not have multiple elements. We can also modify the condition to check if the command script contains 'stash' instead of relying on the second word.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script:
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
``` 

With this correction, the function will first check if the command script contains 'stash' and then verify if the 'usage:' text is present in the stderr to determine if it's related to `git stash`. This approach also eliminates the likelihood of an IndexError when splitting the command script.
