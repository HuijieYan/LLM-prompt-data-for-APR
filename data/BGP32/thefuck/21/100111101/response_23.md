### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when trying to split `command.script` and access the second element, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always contain at least two words, which is not always the case. In this test scenario, `command.script` has only one word `'git'`, causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If the script contains only one word, we should return `False`. Additionally, we can also check for the presence of the word `'stash'` in the command script to further ensure we are matching the correct command.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2 or 'stash' not in script_words:
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` and the presence of `'stash'` in the script before accessing the second word, we ensure that the function won't encounter an `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
