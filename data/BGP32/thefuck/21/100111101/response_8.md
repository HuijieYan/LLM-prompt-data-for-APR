The bug in the provided function `match` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` because it is trying to access the second element of the split script without checking if it exists first. This issue arises from assuming that the input command script always has at least two elements after splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the split result has enough elements before accessing the second element. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we first verify the length of the split script before trying to access the second element. Now the function should pass the failing test case provided.
