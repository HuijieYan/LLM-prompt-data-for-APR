### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is failing because it is trying to access the second element of the split command.script without checking if it exists. In the failing test, the `command.script` only contains 'git', which leads to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split operation on `command.script` generates at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by first checking the length of the split list before proceeding.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first split the `command.script`, check if it has at least two elements, then proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. This modification ensures that the function will not encounter an IndexError when trying to access an element that does not exist.
