### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` by looking for the keyword 'stash' in the command's script and 'usage:' in the command's stderr.
2. The bug occurs when trying to access the second element of the split script without proper validation, leading to an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test case provides a command with script `'git'` and stderr containing information related to `git stash`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is split correctly before accessing its elements.

### Solution
We should validate the length of the split script before trying to access its second element to prevent the `IndexError`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By validating the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` and ensure that the function can correctly identify commands related to `git stash`.
