### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and access the second element in the list to check if it equals to 'stash'. However, in the failing test scenario, the `command.script` does not contain any spaces, so splitting it will result in a list with only one element. Therefore, trying to access the second element will cause an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` does not contain any spaces before splitting it. We can check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first splitting `command.script` and then checking for the length of the resulting list before accessing the second element for comparison, we ensure that the function will not encounter an `IndexError` in situations where the script does not contain spaces.
