The bug in the function is caused by assuming that the command script can always be split into multiple parts. In this specific case, the script is just `'git'`, and when trying to access index 1 after splitting on whitespace, it results in an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two parts to avoid the IndexError. We should also check if the second part is 'stash' to make sure we are checking the correct command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This updated function first splits the command script and then checks if the length is at least 2 before proceeding to check for 'stash' at index 1. If the length is less than 2, it returns False, indicating that the condition for matching is not met.
