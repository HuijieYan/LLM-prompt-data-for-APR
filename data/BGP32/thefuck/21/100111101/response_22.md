The bug in the current implementation of the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` attribute always has at least two elements when calling `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in this case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return `False`. Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
        
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will check if `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to compare the second element with `'stash'`. If there are not enough elements, it will return `False`, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.

This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case provided.
