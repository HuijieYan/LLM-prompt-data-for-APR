### Fixing the bug

#### Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs when the `command.script` does not contain a second word (list index out of range error). 

#### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is not always true.

#### Fix:
We need to first check if there are enough words in the `command.script` before accessing the second word. We can do this by splitting the `command.script` and checking the length of the resulting list.

#### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By updating the function to check the length of `splited_script`, we prevent the index out of range error and ensure that the function behaves correctly in all cases.
