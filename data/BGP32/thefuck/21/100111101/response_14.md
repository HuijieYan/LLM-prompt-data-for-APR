### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the buggy function is assuming that the command script will always have at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing the second word.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is throwing an `IndexError` because the `command.script.split()` method is splitting the script into a list of words, but if the script has only one word (like in this case where the script is 'git'), then the index `[1]` access will throw an `IndexError`. 

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the script is split into words before trying to access the second word. This can be done by checking the length of the split list before accessing any specific index.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the `splited_script` list before accessing the second index, we avoid the `IndexError` and the function should now work correctly.
