### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script includes the word 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. However, the bug is due to the assumption that the script will always have more than one word, resulting in an index out of range error when trying to access index 1 of the splitted script.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the script always has more than one word, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split command script before trying to access index 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the index is valid and avoid the `IndexError`.
