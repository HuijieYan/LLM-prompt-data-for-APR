The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to access a non-existent index in the split command. When splitting the command script into a list, if there is only one element (in this case, 'git'), trying to access index 1 will result in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before checking the value at index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will now return False if the script does not contain the keyword 'stash' as the second element after splitting, preventing the IndexError that was previously occurring. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
