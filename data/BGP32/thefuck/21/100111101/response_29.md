The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the buggy function is failing with an `IndexError: list index out of range` because it assumes there will always be at least two words in the command script before calling `split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the command script is split into words before accessing the second word. We can do this by first checking if the script can be split, and then checking if the second word is 'stash' to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script into words
    script_words = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if there are at least two words in the script and the second word is 'stash'
    if len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle cases where the command script does not have at least two words before 'stash' and avoid the `IndexError`.

This correction ensures that we split the script into words and then check if the second word is 'stash' before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
