### Explanation:
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` to check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` only contains 'git', so splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can check the length of the split list before proceeding.

### Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
