### Identification of the bug
The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that `command.script.split()[1]` will always have a valid index when checking if the command is related to `git stash`. In this case, the input command is only 'git', and splitting it by spaces will result in a list with only one element. Therefore, accessing index 1 will raise an `IndexError`.

### Fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If the list doesn't have enough elements, we can safely assume that the command is not related to `git stash`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that an `IndexError` will not be raised, fixing the bug.
