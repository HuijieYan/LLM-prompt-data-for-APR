### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command's script is "stash" and if the string "usage:" is in the command's stderr. However, the buggy function assumes that the command's script will always have at least two elements after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing index 1 of the split script.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` is split into multiple elements before trying to access index 1. We can also add a check to ensure that the script is not empty before performing any further checks.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1 and ensuring that `splited_script` is not empty, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original buggy function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
