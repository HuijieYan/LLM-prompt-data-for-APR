The bug in the provided function is due to the assumption that the command script can be split by spaces and the second element compared to 'stash'. However, in the failing test case, the command script does not contain a space-separated second element.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function assumes that the script passed in the command can be split by spaces to access the second element, but the actual script in the failing test does not contain multiple space-separated elements.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the logic in the `match` function to properly check if the script contains 'stash' as the first word without splitting it.

### A corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By updating the `match` function as shown above, it will correctly check if 'stash' is present in the command script without relying on splitting by spaces, thus fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
