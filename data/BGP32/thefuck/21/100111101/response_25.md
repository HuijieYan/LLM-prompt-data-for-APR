The bug in the provided function is caused by accessing the second element of the splitted command script (`command.script.split()[1]`) without checking if there are actually elements in the list returned by `split()`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command script has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(splitted_script) >= 2
        and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and then checks if there are at least 2 elements in the list before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function behaves correctly.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
