### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is caused by trying to access an index in the split command script without proper checking. When the script does not contain enough elements to be split, an IndexError is raised, leading to the failure of the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only access the index if the list returned by `split()` has enough elements. We can do this by checking the length of the list before accessing the index.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version first splits the script and then checks if there are enough elements in the split list before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and make the function behave as expected.
