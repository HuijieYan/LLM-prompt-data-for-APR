The buggy function provided above is a git command rule designed to fix an incorrect "git stash" command. The function is supposed to identify if the command matches the pattern where the second argument is 'stash' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

The bug in this function lies in the fact that it directly splits the command script by whitespace and checks if the second element is 'stash'. This method may lead to an IndexError if there are not enough elements in the split list, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, it is better to split the command script explicitly and check if the length of the split script is at least two before checking the second element for 'stash'.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) >= 2
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version above, the script is split once before the conditions are checked. This ensures that there are at least two elements in the script before trying to access the second element. This modification prevents the IndexError and ensures the function works correctly.
