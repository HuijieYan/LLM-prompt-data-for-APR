## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to check if a Git command matches the pattern where the second word is 'stash' and the `stderr` output contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the bug in the function is that it does not handle cases where the command string (`command.script`) does not have enough words to split, resulting in an `IndexError`. 

## Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split result has at least two elements.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is an IndexError that occurs when attempting to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without verifying if there are enough elements after splitting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split result before accessing specific indices.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the `command.script` is split into words stored in `split_script`. Now we check if `split_script` has more than one element before checking if the second word is 'stash'. This modification prevents the IndexError issue and ensures that the function works as intended.
