## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is using the `split` method on `command.script` to access the second element in the array without any error checking. This can lead to potential errors if the script does not contain enough elements after splitting by spaces.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing `command.script.split()[1]` without checking for the length of the split array.
2. Checking for the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr` without verifying the context.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function occurs when the `command.script` does not contain at least two elements after splitting. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element. Additionally, checking for the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr` may not accurately determine the match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split array of `command.script` before accessing the second element.
2. Verify the context of the error message in a more robust way.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        if script_parts[1] == 'stash':
            return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and check if there are at least two parts before trying to access the second element. We then check if the second element is equal to 'stash' and verify the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. If all conditions are met, we return `True`, otherwise, we return `False`.
