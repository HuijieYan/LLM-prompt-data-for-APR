## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to check if a given command pertains to the use of `git stash`. It checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains the string 'usage:'. The bug in this function may arise from assuming the second word of the script should always be 'stash', which might not always be the case.

## Identified Issue:
The bug is caused by directly splitting the command script and assuming the second element is always the command word. This assumption may lead to index out of range errors if the script has fewer than two elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the script has at least two elements by first splitting the script.
2. Confirm that the first element is 'git' to ensure it's a git command.
3. Verify if 'stash' is the second element in the split script.
4. Check if the command's stderr contains 'usage:'.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    if len(script_elements) >= 2 and script_elements[0] == 'git':
        return (script_elements[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

In the corrected code, we first split the script into its individual elements and verify that it contains at least two elements. We then explicitly check if the first element is 'git' to ensure it's a git command. This approach avoids index out of range errors and ensures the correct identification of git stash commands.
