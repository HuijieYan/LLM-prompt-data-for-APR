The buggy function provided is intended to match a specific git command operation involving stash and error output related to 'usage:'. However, there are potential error locations in the current implementation that need to be addressed:

1. The function assumes that the second word in the command script is 'stash' without performing any checks. This assumption can lead to index out of range error if the command script doesn't contain the expected number of words.

2. The condition for matching the error message 'usage:' in the stderr is not sufficient. There might be other error messages or variations that are not being considered.

To fix the bug in the function, we should update the function to handle cases where the command script doesn't contain the expected number of words and improve the condition for matching the error message.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False

    if script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first split the command script into words and check if the length is sufficient before proceeding with further checks.
2. Only if the command script contains at least 2 words, we then check if the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr to confirm a match.

With these changes, the function should now handle edge cases more effectively and correctly identify the desired git command operation.
