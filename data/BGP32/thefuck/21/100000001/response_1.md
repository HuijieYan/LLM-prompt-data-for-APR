## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `match` is used to determine whether the command is related to Git stash and if there is an error message containing the word 'usage'. However, there is a potential bug in the function that needs to be fixed.

## Potential error locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is within the `split()` method call on the `script` attribute of the `command`. If the command doesn't have more than 1 word after splitting (command.script.split()[1]), it will cause an `IndexError`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the command has at least two words after splitting, which may not always be the case. If the command has only one word after splitting, trying to access the second element (`[1]`) will raise an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command has at least two words after splitting before accessing the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split list.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_command) > 1
            and splitted_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command and save it to a variable `splitted_command`. Then, we check if the length of `splitted_command` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure the function functions correctly.
