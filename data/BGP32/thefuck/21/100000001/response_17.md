### Analysis:
The buggy function receives a `command` object as input and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Using `split()` directly on `command.script` without checking for possible index out of range error.
2. Checking for 'usage:' in the entire `command.stderr` without considering line by line.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word resulting in an index out of range error in the statement `command.script.split()[1]`. Additionally, the 'usage:' keyword might not always be present in the same line in `command.stderr`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `command.script` contains more than one word before accessing the second word.
2. Iterate through the lines of `command.stderr` to check for the presence of 'usage:'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
            if 'usage:' in line:
                return True
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version above:
- We first split the `command.script` into words and check if it has more than one word before accessing the second word.
- Then, we iterate through the lines of `command.stderr` to find if 'usage:' is present in any of the lines.
- If both conditions are met, we return `True`, otherwise, we return `False` at the end.
