### Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `match` is supposed to return True if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, there is a potential bug in the current implementation.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The current implementation is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash'. This might cause an `IndexError` if there are not enough words in the command script.
2. The condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` might not accurately check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug might be caused due to the incorrect indexing of the command script and potential issues with checking 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to check if the first word in the script is 'stash' instead of the second word to avoid potential `IndexError`.
2. Use a more robust method to check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Fixing the bug:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Updated function:
The updated function now checks if there are at least 2 words in the command script before checking if the second word is 'stash'. Additionally, it checks if 'usage:' is present in the stderr for a more accurate matching logic.
