## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to match a specific git command that involves stashing changes. The function checks if the second word in the command matches 'stash' and if the stderr output of the command contains 'usage:'. However, there is a potential issue with the code.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line assumes that the second element of the split script will always be 'stash', which may not be the case if the command is incorrect or formatted differently.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs when the command does not contain 'stash' as the second word, causing the comparison to fail even though the command is related to stashing changes. This limitation makes the function unreliable.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to find a more robust way to identify commands related to stashing changes without relying on the positional order of words in the command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the script is split into separate parts, and the function checks if 'stash' is present anywhere in the command instead of relying on its position. This modification makes the function more flexible and capable of matching a wider range of stash-related commands.
