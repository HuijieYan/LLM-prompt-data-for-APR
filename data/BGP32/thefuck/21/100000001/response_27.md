## Analysis:
The buggy function is a `match` function used in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function is supposed to check if the command is related to stash in Git and if the usage information is present in the stderr of the command. However, the bug in the current function is that it does not check if the command script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. This can lead to an `IndexError` when splitting the script.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.
2. Checking for 'usage:' in the whole stderr string, not just the presence of 'usage:'

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the split command script would always have at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` when the condition is checked.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the split command script has enough elements before trying to access the second element.
2. Modify the condition to check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr, not just contained within the whole string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and store it in a variable `split_script`. Then we check if the size of the split script is greater than 1 to ensure we have enough elements. We also check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This approach fixes both potential errors in the original function.
