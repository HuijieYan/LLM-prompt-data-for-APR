The buggy function is checking if a Git command includes 'stash' as the second word of the command, and if the 'usage:' string is in the standard error output of the command. The intention is to match a particular situation where a Git command related to stashing has failed due to incorrect usage.

The potential error in this function is that it assumes 'stash' will always be the second word in the command. If the user enters a command like 'git stash apply', the function will no longer match because 'stash' is not the second word in this case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if 'stash' is present in the command rather than looking at its position. We can also update the condition to check if 'usage:' is in the command's output rather than the standard error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.output)
```

This updated version of the function checks if 'stash' is present in the command's script and if 'usage:' is in the command's output, which is a more flexible and accurate way to determine if the command corresponds to a failed stashing operation.
