## Analysis:
The buggy function currently checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. The potential error locations in this function could be:
1. The script may not always have the desired word at index 1 if there are multiple spaces and words in the command.
2. The match may not be accurate because the presence of 'usage:' in stderr may not always indicate that the command failed due to incorrect usage.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current function is that it is checking for 'usage:' string in the stderr to determine if the command failed. However, a command can fail for reasons other than incorrect usage, leading to incorrect matching.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the command output contains known failure phrases that directly indicate a failed command instead of relying solely on 'usage:'.
2. Use a more robust way to extract the main git command to ensure accurate matching.
3. Verify the command exit status or specific strings in the stderr to confirm a failed git command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    main_command = command.script.split()[1] if len(command.script.split()) > 1 else ''
    failed_phrases = ['fatal', 'error', 'unknown command']  # Add more phrases as needed
    
    return main_command == 'stash' and any(phrase in command.stderr for phrase in failed_phrases)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function:
1. We extract the main git command accurately using index [1] only if the split list has more than 1 element.
2. We check for specific failure phrases in stderr to determine if the command failed.
3. By using 'any', we ensure that at least one of the failed phrases is present in the stderr for successful match.
