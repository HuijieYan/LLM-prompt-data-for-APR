## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the Git command being executed is related to stashing changes based on the script and stderr of the command. It returns True if the command is related to stashing and 'usage:' is present in the stderr, otherwise it returns False.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
One potential error location in the buggy function is the direct access to the second word of the command script using `split()[1]` without proper error handling. If the command script does not contain multiple words, this approach could lead to an IndexError.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the function arises from assuming that the second word of the command script will always be the action, which is not always the case. If the command script does not contain multiple words, the comparison will throw an IndexError, causing the function to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script contains multiple words before trying to access the second word. We can also perform checks to make the function more robust and handle cases where the script may not match the assumed format.

## Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script into words and then check if the length of the words list is at least 2 before proceeding to compare the second word with 'stash'. This approach ensures that we avoid the IndexError that could occur in the buggy version.
