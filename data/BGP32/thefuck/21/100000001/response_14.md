## Analysis
The provided buggy function `match` is supposed to determine if a Git command matches the pattern of invoking `git stash` but with an error message containing 'usage:'. The function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' appears in the standard error output.

## Potential Error Locations
1. If the command script has less than 2 words, `command.script.split()[1]` would raise an `IndexError` which can cause the function to fail.
2. If the error message in `command.stderr` does not exactly match 'usage:', the function may not recognize it as a match even when it is present.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in this function is primarily associated with the potential error locations identified above. The function does not handle cases where the command script might not have the second word (e.g., `git`) and where the error message may contain 'usage:' but not exclusively. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Check the length of the split script before accessing the second word to prevent an `IndexError`.
2. Use a more flexible pattern to match the error message containing 'usage:' in a case-insensitive manner.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower()
    return False
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script and check if it has at least 2 words. Then we check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' (in a case-insensitive manner) is present in the error message. This version addresses the identified bug locations and provides a more robust matching functionality.
