The buggy function provided is attempting to match a command to determine if it is a git stash command with an error message indicating 'usage:'. However, there is a potential bug in the current implementation.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the logic of splitting the command script and checking the second element to be 'stash'.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the command script does not have more than one element after splitting, it will result in an "index out of range" error when trying to access the second element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script to ensure that there are at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should also check if the first element is 'git' to ensure it is a git command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1
            and script[0] == 'git'
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and store it in the 'script' variable. Then, we check if the length of 'script' is greater than 1, if the first element is 'git', the second element is 'stash', and the error message contains 'usage:'. This approach ensures that we avoid the index out of range error and properly match git stash commands with the desired error message.
