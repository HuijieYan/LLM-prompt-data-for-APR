## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is meant to check if a git command is a stash command that has an error message containing 'usage:'. However, the implementation is flawed because it directly tries to split the command script without checking the length of the split list. This can lead to an `IndexError` when the split list does not have the required number of elements.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. If the command script does not have enough elements after splitting, it will result in an `IndexError`.
2. The current implementation does not handle cases where the script can have multiple possible arguments, not just 'stash'.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function assumes that the split list will always have at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` if the assumption is not met. Additionally, the function only checks for the presence of 'stash' at index 1, not considering other possible arguments.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split list before accessing elements to avoid an `IndexError`.
2. Check for the presence of 'stash' within the split list, considering all possible arguments.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, the command script is split into parts and stored in `script_parts`. The function then checks if 'stash' is present within the split script parts and if the 'usage:' message is in the command's stderr. This revised implementation ensures error-free execution and a more robust handling of possible git command arguments.
