## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stdout contains the string `'usage:'`. The current bug occurs because the function assumes that the command will have at least 2 elements when split by whitespace, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the command.script always has at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. In the failing test case, when the command.script is only `'git'`, the function throws an `IndexError` as it tries to access index 1 which is out of range.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the `splited_script` variable before accessing any index.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `splited_script` list before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring previously. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
