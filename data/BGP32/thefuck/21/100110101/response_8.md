The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the input `command.script` always contains at least two words, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the split result. To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `command.script` actually contains enough words before attempting to access the second word.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1
        and split_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will first split the `command.script` and then check if there are enough words in the split result before trying to access the second word. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
