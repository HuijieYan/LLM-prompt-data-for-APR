## Correction

The bug in the `match` function arises from trying to access the second element of the split command.script without checking if there are enough elements in the list. To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command is long enough before trying to access an index. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the function will only try to access the second element of the split command if the split list contains at least 2 elements. This modification prevents the IndexError when the split list is too short.
