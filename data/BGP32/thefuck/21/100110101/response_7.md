The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The bug occurs because it assumes that the command script will always have at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the split script.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing index 1. If the length is sufficient, we can proceed with the existing logic of checking for 'stash' and 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version will first check if the split script contains at least 2 elements before proceeding to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring in cases where the script is too short. The function will now return `False` when the conditions are not met, which aligns with the expected behavior when the command does not match.
