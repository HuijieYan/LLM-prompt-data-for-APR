## Fixing the buggy function

### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The bug occurs because the function assumes that there will always be a second word in the script, causing an `IndexError` when splitting the script.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the code to ensure that there are enough words in the script before attempting to access the second word to prevent the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version first checks if the script contains more than one word before trying to access the second word. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring. The function now correctly checks if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr, as expected.
