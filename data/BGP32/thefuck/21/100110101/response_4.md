Based on the error message and the failing test, the bug occurs because the `command.script.split()` is attempting to split the script using space as a delimiter, but the script only contains a single element `'git'` which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an element at index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to verify if the length of the splitted script is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the element at index 1. If it is not, then the function should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splitted_script) >= 2:
        return splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

This fix ensures that the script is split and checked for the 'stash' command only when it contains at least two elements, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
