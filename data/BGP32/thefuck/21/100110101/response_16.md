The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, this approach is causing an `IndexError` when the list doesn't have a second element, leading to the failure of the test case `test_not_match`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command has more than one element before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first ensure that the `splited_script` list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and make the function behave correctly with the provided test case.
