## Solution

### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the usage message is present in the stderr. The buggy part is where it tries to split the script and access the second element without ensuring its existence. This leads to an IndexError when the script is not split properly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the script is split without checking if there are enough elements to match the condition `command.script.split()[1]`

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that there are at least 2 elements in the split script before accessing the second element.

### Updated Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of splited_script before accessing the second element, we avoid the IndexError. The updated code should now pass the failing test.
