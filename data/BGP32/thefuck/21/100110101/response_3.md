To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the `IndexError: list index out of range` that is occurring. This error happens because the function assumes that splitting the `command.script` will always result in a list with at least two elements, leading to an attempt to access the second element without checking if it exists.

Here's a corrected version of the function that includes a check to handle this scenario:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation of the changes:
- We first check if the length of the split `command.script` is less than 2. If it is, we return `False` to avoid the `IndexError`.
- If the length is sufficient, we proceed with the original comparison logic to determine if the command is related to `git stash`.

With this correction, the updated function should now pass the failing test case provided.
