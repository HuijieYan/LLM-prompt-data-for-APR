### Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case, the error occurs because the `command.script.split()` operation is attempting to access the second element of the split list without checking if it exists. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" which means that the split list doesn't have a second element.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the split list has more than one element before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This change ensures that we don't encounter an IndexError when accessing the second element. With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test case and return the expected output.
