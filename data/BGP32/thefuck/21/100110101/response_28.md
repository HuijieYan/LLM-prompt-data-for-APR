Based on the error message and the failing test, we can identify the bug in the `match` function. The bug is occurring because the `split()` method is being called on `command.script` without checking if the script contains multiple words. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` can be split into multiple words before accessing the second element. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split operation produces multiple words before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly for the given test case.
