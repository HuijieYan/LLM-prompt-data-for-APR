## Correction

The bug in the current implementation is caused by assuming that the `command.script` always contains a valid list of arguments separated by spaces. The `IndexError` is raised when attempting to access an index that does not exist in the list returned by `command.script.split()`.

To fix this issue, we need to check the length of the list returned by `command.script.split()` before trying to access any index. Also, we need to ensure that the second element in the split list is being compared to `'stash'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

By performing the length check before accessing the second element in the split list, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
