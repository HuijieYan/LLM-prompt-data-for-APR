## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Location
The bug is likely causing an `IndexError` because the code is splitting the `command.script` without checking if the split actually contains more than one element. This can happen if the `command.script` does not include any space-separated elements.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test case is providing a `Command` object with script as `'git'`, and when the `match` function tries to split this script using `split()[1]`, an `IndexError` occurs because there is only one element after the split operation. This leads to the list index being out of range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the code needs to be updated to first check if the split result contains more than one element before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
