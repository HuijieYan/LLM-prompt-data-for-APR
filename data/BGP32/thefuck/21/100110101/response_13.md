## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is failing with an `IndexError: list index out of range` because it is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if it exists. This leads to an issue when the script does not contain any additional arguments after the initial `git` command.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain more than one element after splitting, which results in an IndexError when this condition is not met. 

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the length of the split `command.script` is less than 2. We can add a condition to check this before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

With this correction, the function will first check if there are at least two elements in `command.script` before trying to access the second element. If the condition is not met, it returns `False`, preventing the IndexError.
