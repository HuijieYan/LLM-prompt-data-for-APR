## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error occurs due to the assumption that there will always be at least 2 words in the command script, leading to an index out of range error if the script contains only one word.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` can be split into at least 2 elements resulting in an index out of range error when accessing the second element.

### Strategy for fixing:
We need to check if the split command script contains at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version of the function first checks if the split script contains at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This prevents the index out of range error and ensures that the function can handle cases where the script is not formatted as expected.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
