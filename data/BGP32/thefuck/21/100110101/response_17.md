## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The bug in the `match` function arises from trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without verifying if it exists. If the command script does not contain any whitespace separated values, attempting to access the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation on the command script produces more than 1 element before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the code will not throw an `IndexError`. This corrected version will address the bug and pass the failing test case.
