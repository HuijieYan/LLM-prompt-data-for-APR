## Correction:

The issue in the buggy function is that it assumes the `script` attribute of the `Command` object can be directly split without checking the length first, leading to an `IndexError` when the split result is attempted to be accessed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `script` attribute of the `Command` object and then check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before accessing the index to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

This correction ensures that the function will not raise an `IndexError` and will work correctly for the provided test case and expected input/output values.
