## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the error message includes 'usage:'. The bug occurs when `split()[1]` is called on the command script without checking if it actually contains more than one element after splitting. This causes an `IndexError` when the script does not contain any space-separated elements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script always contains at least one word after splitting by spaces. When the script doesn't have any spaces, accessing the second element of the resulting list raises an `IndexError`.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list from `command.script` has the necessary elements before accessing `split()[1]`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before trying to access `split_script[1]`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
