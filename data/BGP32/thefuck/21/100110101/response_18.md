## Correction:

The buggy function is trying to split the command script using whitespace and then access the second element `[1]` assuming it represents the command name. However, when the script contains only one element (in this case, just `'git'`), accessing the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split script has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the check `len(splitted_script) >= 2`, we ensure that there are at least two elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and fix the bug.
