## Fixing the bug

### Problem:
The buggy function is trying to split the command script by whitespaces and access the second element directly without checking if the script actually contains more than one element. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist.

### Solution:
We should first check if the script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function behaves correctly. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
