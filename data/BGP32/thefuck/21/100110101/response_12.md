## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if a Git command is related to stashing based on the presence of the word "stash" in the command script and the presence of the word "usage:" in the stderr. The bug is caused by assuming that the script will always have at least two elements when split by spaces, which leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `split()[1]` operation is trying to access the second element of the split list directly without checking if the list has enough elements. In this case, when the script consists of only `'git'`, splitting it by spaces results in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` split results in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also simplify the logic by using the `in` operator to check if `'stash'` is in the script directly.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr
            and len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash')
``` 

By adding the check `len(script_parts) > 1` before accessing `script_parts[1]`, we avoid the IndexError and ensure that the correct comparison is made. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
