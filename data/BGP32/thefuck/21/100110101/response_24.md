## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the usage information is present in the stderr. The current implementation fails due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script. The error occurs because when the script is split, there might not be a second element if the script does not contain multiple words.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be a second element in the split script, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing index 1.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if there are at least 2 elements in the split script before trying to access the second element.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splitted_script) > 1:
        return (splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By checking the length of `splitted_script` first, we ensure that we only access index 1 if it exists. This correction should prevent the `IndexError` and allow the function to work correctly.
