The bug in the `match` function is caused by trying to access an index that does not exist when splitting the `command.script` string. The error message shows that the list index is out of range, indicating that the script does not have a second element after splitting.

To fix the bug, we need to check if splitting the `command.script` would result in at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the `command.script` can be split into at least two parts before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This ensures that the index is within range and prevents the IndexError.
