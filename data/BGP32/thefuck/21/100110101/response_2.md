## Solution

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the `'usage:'` string is in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs when splitting `command.script` if it does not contain a second word, which leads to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have multiple words to split. If `command.script` is just `'git'` without any further arguments, splitting it will result in a list with only one element, and trying to access index 1 (the second element) will trigger an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
We need to first check if `command.script` contains any words before attempting to split it. If it does, we can proceed with the split operation and then check the second word.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        splited_script = command.script.split()
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

Now, the function first checks if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before further processing. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` by ensuring there are multiple words to access. If there is no second word, the function returns `False`.
