The bug in the current function is caused by trying to split the command script without checking if it contains multiple parts. When the script contains only one part ('git' in this case), accessing index 1 of the split result causes an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command script contains multiple parts before trying to access index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that we check if the split result has multiple parts before attempting to access index 1. This change should address the IndexError and make the function work correctly for the provided test case and expected input/output values.
