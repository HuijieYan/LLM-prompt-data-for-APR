## Solution

### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `match` function due to the assumption that `command.script.split()` always contains at least two elements. When the `command.script` value does not have a second element after splitting, an `IndexError` is raised, resulting in a failure.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of `command.script.split()` before accessing its elements to avoid `IndexError`. We can modify the `match` function to handle this edge case gracefully.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Updated Test Case:
The updated `test_not_match` test case should now pass successfully, as the bug causing the `IndexError` has been resolved.
