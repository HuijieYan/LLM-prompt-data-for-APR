## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error occurs because the `command.script.split()` call assumes that there will always be at least one word in the script, leading to the 'list index out of range' error when the script is empty.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that there are words in the script before splitting it. We can accomplish this by checking if the script is not empty before trying to split it.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the `script_words` list has more than one element before accessing the second index, we can prevent the 'list index out of range' error. This correction ensures that the function will work correctly even when the command's script is empty.
