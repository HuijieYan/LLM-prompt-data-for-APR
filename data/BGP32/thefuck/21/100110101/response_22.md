## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element of the list created by splitting the `command.script`. However, if the `command.script` does not have at least two elements, it will raise an `IndexError` as seen in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before accessing any index.

## The Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the `split_script` list before accessing the index, we ensure that the function does not raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.
