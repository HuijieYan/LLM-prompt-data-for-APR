## Correction:

The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when splitting. To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring before. This correction ensures that the function will work correctly for all cases, including the one mentioned in the failing test.
