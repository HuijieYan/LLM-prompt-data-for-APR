The bug in the current implementation is causing an `IndexError` because the `command.script.split()` is being accessed without checking if the split actually produces any elements. This leads to a situation where trying to access the index 1 without any elements in the list causes the error.

To fix this issue, we need to first ensure that the split operation generates at least one element before trying to access index 1. We can also simplify the condition for matching the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splitted_script) > 1 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This updated version checks if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring. Now, the function should pass the failing test case and produce the correct output for the given input values.
