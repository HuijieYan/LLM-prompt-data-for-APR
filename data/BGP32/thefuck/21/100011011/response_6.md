### Analysis:
- The function `match` is designed to check if the second word in a command script is `'stash'` and if the error message contains the term `'usage:'`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to a list index out of range.
- The input `command.script` is `'git'`, and the `split()` method is used to split it at whitespace. Since there is only one word in the input, the index `1` is out of range, causing the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming the existence of a second word in `command.script` without proper validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` can be split before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first split `command.script` into individual words and then check if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This way, we prevent the index out of range error.
