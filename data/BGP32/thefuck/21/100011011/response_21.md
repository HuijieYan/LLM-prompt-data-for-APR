### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the command script contains 'stash' at index 1 and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
2. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurs, specifically `IndexError: list index out of range`.
3. The runtime values show that the input script is `'git'`, which has only one element after splitting, leading to the `IndexError`.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the bug occurs when the script is just `'git'`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be an element at index 1 after splitting the command script by spaces. When the script is just `'git'`, there is only one element in the resulting list, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing index 1. Additionally, we should check if 'stash' is in the script rather than at a specific index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the script into parts and then check if 'stash' is in those parts, ensuring there is no `IndexError`. This fix will correctly identify the command containing 'stash' and 'usage:' in stderr while handling cases where 'stash' is not at index 1.
