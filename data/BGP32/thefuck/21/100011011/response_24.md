### Analysis:
- The function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
- The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `split()` on an empty `command.script`.
- The test case provides `command.script` as `'git'`, which leads to an empty list after splitting.
- This happens because the function is not handling cases where `command.script` might not have the necessary number of elements after splitting.
- The bug causes the function to crash and not properly handle scenarios where the `command.script` is insufficient.

### Bug:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` does not have enough elements after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix:
Modify the function to first check if there are enough elements in the split list before directly accessing the second index. Also, validate that 'stash' is present in the command script before further processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding the check `len(script_words) > 1` before accessing `script_words[1]`, we ensure that there are enough elements in the split list to avoid the `IndexError`. This modification should address the bug and resolve the failing test.
