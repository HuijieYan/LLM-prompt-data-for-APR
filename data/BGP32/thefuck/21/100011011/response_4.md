### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` string and check if the second part is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test scenario, the `command.script` value is just `'git'`, which results in an `IndexError` because there is no second element after splitting the string.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two parts after splitting `command.script`. In this case, with `command.script` being `'git'`, there is only one part after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are at least two parts after splitting the `command.script` before checking if the second part is `'stash'`. We should also handle the case where there is only one part after splitting.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version of the function, we first check if there are at least two parts after splitting the `command.script` to avoid the `IndexError`. Then we proceed to check if the second part is `'stash'`. This fix should address the `IndexError` and ensure the function works correctly for the given scenario.
