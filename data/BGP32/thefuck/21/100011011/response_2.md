### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function is designed to check if a git command matches the pattern of having "stash" in the second position after splitting the command script. The error message indicates an "IndexError" due to the list index being out of range when accessing the second element after splitting the script.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the buggy function is occurring at the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always contain at least two elements after splitting. In this case, the command script is just "git," which results in an empty list after splitting and accessing the second index element.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has enough elements before accessing the second index. We can also add an additional check to ensure that the script contains "git" command before proceeding.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[0] == 'git' and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function will first check the length of the split parts and if the first part is 'git' before proceeding to check if the second part is 'stash.' This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and provide the desired behavior for the function.
