### Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` by spaces and access the second element to check if it equals to `'stash'`. However, in the case where the `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting it by spaces will result in a single element list with only `'git'`, which leads to the `IndexError` because the function is trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have at least two parts when split by spaces. In cases where only `'git'` is passed as `command.script`, the function raises an `IndexError` because there is only one element in the list after splitting.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split result is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. We should also ensure that the first element is `'git'` before proceeding to check if the second element is `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) >= 2 and parts[0] == 'git' and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into parts and checks if the length of the split result is at least 2. It also confirms that the first element is `'git'` before specifically checking if the second element is `'stash'`.
