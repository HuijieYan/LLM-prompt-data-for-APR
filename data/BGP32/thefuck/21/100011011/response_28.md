### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error occurs because the `command.script` might not contain more than one word, causing the `split()` method to raise an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test is passing a `Command` object with `script='git'`, which is why the split method fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where `command.script` has fewer than 2 words.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the index 1, we ensure that the bug related to the `IndexError: list index out of range` is fixed.
