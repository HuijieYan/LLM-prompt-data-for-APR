### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is supposed to check if the command passed is related to Git stash (specifically if the second word in the command is "stash") and if the stderr of the command contains the word "usage:". However, the bug is triggered when the command doesn't have more than one word, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second word in the split command.

### Potential error locations
The error is likely caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the return statement. If the command string doesn't have more than one word, splitting it based on whitespace and accessing the second element will lead to an IndexError.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command string has at least two words (or elements after splitting). When the command is just "git", with no additional arguments like "stash", splitting the string will result in a list with only one element, triggering the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script part of the command has more than one word before trying to access the second word. We can also simplify the check by directly checking if "stash" is in the script without splitting.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By directly checking if "stash" is in the script part of the command, the function will be able to correctly identify commands related to Git stash. Also, the IndexError due to splitting the script is avoided in this corrected version.
