### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that the `split()` operation on `command.script` is failing because the script might not have enough words to split.

The `command.script` in this case is simply `'git'`, so when splitting, it only has one element, and accessing element at index 1 results in an `IndexError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Accessing index 1 of the result of `split()` on `command.script`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always contain at least two words when split, resulting in an `IndexError` when accessing an index that doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. We can check the length of the split result before accessing index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we first split `command.script` into words and store them in `script_words`. Then, we check if the length of `script_words` is at least 2 before accessing index 1. This change ensures that the function doesn't throw an `IndexError` when accessing index 1.
