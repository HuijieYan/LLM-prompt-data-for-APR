### Analysis
The function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. The bug occurs when the `command.script.split()` operation does not create a list with enough elements to access the index 1. This causes an `IndexError`.

### Bug Explanation
In this case, the `command.script` is `'git'` which does not contain any whitespace character to split into a list. Hence, when trying to access index 1 of the resulting split, it raises an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to first check if splitting the `command.script` will actually produce enough elements to access index 1. If not, we should handle this scenario gracefully to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first checks if `script_words` has more than one element before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
