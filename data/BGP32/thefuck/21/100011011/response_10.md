### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, suggesting that the `split()[1]` operation on `command.script` is failing due to the absence of a second element in the output of `split()`.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs because the `command.script` parameter may not contain multiple words, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the `command.script` contains multiple words before trying to access the second word. Additionally, we should ensure that the word `'stash'` is still present in the split text at the appropriate location.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and then check if it contains multiple elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This approach avoids the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
