## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`. The error occurs because the `command.script` in Case 1 is just `'git'`, and splitting it by whitespace results in a list with only one element. This leads to the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two parts when split. However, in the given Case 1, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, so splitting it yields a list with only one element. Trying to access index 1 of this list leads to the `IndexError`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If the list has fewer elements, we should return False to indicate that the command does not match the criteria.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This modification ensures that we first check if the split list has at least two elements before proceeding to check the specific conditions related to the command.
