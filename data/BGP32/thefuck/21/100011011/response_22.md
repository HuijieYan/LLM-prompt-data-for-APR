### Analysis:
The buggy function `match(command)` is intended to check if the git command being run is related to stashing by checking if the second word in the command starts with 'stash' and if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'. The error message indicates an IndexError because of trying to access the second element in a potentially empty list resulting from splitting an empty string in `command.script`.

### Potential error location:
The potential error is occurring on this line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to split function creating an empty list when splitting an empty string which results in a list index out of range error when trying to access the second element `[1]`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command script is not empty before attempting to split it. We should also check if there are at least two elements after splitting before accessing the second element.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With the corrected version above, we first split the script into a list and check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before comparing the second element and checking for 'usage:' in the command's stderr. This fix ensures that we avoid the IndexError when splitting an empty script.
