### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `match`, is designed to check if the script in the command equals 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. 
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, specifically when trying to access index 1 in an empty list.
3. While the script in the command is 'git' and the stderr contains usage information related to various git commands, the buggy function is incorrectly trying to split the script on whitespaces and access index 1 without checking if there are any elements in the list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first split the string and then check if it contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

The corrected version first checks if the split script has more than 1 element before accessing index 1 to prevent the IndexError. If there are enough elements, it then proceeds to check for 'stash' in the split script and 'usage:' in the stderr. If the conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise False.
