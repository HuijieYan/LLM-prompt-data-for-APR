### Analysis
The buggy function is using `command.script.split()[1]` to access the second element of the split command. However, when the command is just `git` without any additional arguments, this causes an IndexError because there is no element at index 1.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by trying to access the second element of the command when it may not exist, leading to an IndexError. In this case, when the command is just `git`, splitting it by whitespace results in a list with only one element, so trying to access index 1 causes the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If it doesn't, the function should return False. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_split) >= 2 and command_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command and store it in a variable. We then check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before accessing index 1. If the conditions are met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This fix should prevent the IndexError when the command is just `git`.
