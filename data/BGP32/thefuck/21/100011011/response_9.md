### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The error message received is `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the `split()` method on `command.script` is encountering an issue.

### Error Cause
The error occurs because the `split()` method is being called on the `command.script` without proper error handling for cases where there might not be a second word present in the script. In this particular case, when the script is just `'git'`, trying to access the second element of the split list results in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that there are enough elements after splitting the `command.script`. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before attempting to access the second element.

### Correction

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` first and then checking if there are enough words in the split list before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly for different script scenarios.
