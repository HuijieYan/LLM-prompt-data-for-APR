## Analysis
The bug occurs when the command's script does not contain the necessary elements to split and access the desired index. In this case, the script `"git"` does not contain any elements to split, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is sufficient to access index 1 before attempting to access it. If the length is less than 2, we can return False to indicate that the match condition is not met.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version first splits the command script into parts. Then, it checks if the length is at least 2 before accessing index 1 to compare it with `'stash'`. Additionally, it includes the check for `'usage:'` in the command stderr.
