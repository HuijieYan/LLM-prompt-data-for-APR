### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the line where the script is split by whitespaces. If the command script does not contain any whitespace-separated elements (e.g., only 'git'), it will result in an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the command script will always have at least one element after splitting by whitespaces. In this case, when the script is just 'git' without any other elements, the split operation results in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split operation creates a list with more than one element before trying to access index 1. If the list has at least two elements, then we can proceed with comparing the second element to 'stash' and checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, we first check if the split operation results in a list with more than one element (`len(script_elements) > 1`), and then we proceed with comparing the second element to 'stash' and checking for 'usage:' in the command's stderr. This modification ensures that the function will not encounter an IndexError when trying to access index 1 in cases where the script has only one element.
