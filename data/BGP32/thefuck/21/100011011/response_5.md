### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the command script contains `'stash'` and if the command stderr contains `'usage:'`, but it is causing an IndexError when trying to split the command script without handling the possibility of an empty script.

The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to split an empty list at index 1.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that the split command script will always have at least 2 elements, and it tries to access index 1 without verifying if it exists. In this case, the command script is just `'git'`, which leads to an empty list after splitting, causing the IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. If it does not have enough elements, we should return False.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if the split command script has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. If the check fails, it returns False, avoiding the IndexError.
