### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code is splitting `command.script` and trying to access the second element directly without checking if it exists. In the failing test case, when the `command.script` is only `'git'`, splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are more than one element after splitting `command.script` before comparing it to `'stash'`. If there is only one element, we can return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:  # Check if there are more than one element
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False  # Return False if there is only one element in the split script
``` 

By implementing this change, the function will first check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element, avoiding the `IndexError` and resolving the bug.
