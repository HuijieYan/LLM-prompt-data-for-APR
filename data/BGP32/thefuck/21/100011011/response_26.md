### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the provided test case, the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which means splitting it would lead to a list with only one element. Hence, trying to access the second element will raise an `IndexError` since it is out of range.

### Solution
To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by ensuring that the length of the split list is at least two before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return len(split_command) >= 2 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, we ensure that the split command has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element to compare it with `'stash'`. This updated code should fix the `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
