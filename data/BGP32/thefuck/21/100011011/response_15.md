### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is encountering an `IndexError` because it is trying to access an index that does not exist. The function splits the `command.script` by spaces and checks if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in the case where the `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is no second element after splitting by spaces, leading to the IndexError.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting `command.script`, which is not the case when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second element. If there is no second element after splitting, the function should return `False`.

### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1, we ensure that there is at least a second element before trying to access it. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` for cases where there is no second element present.
