The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is occurring because the function is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespaces and access the second element (`[1]`) without verifying that the `command.script` actually contains any elements after splitting. This results in an `IndexError` when the split operation returns an empty list or a list with only one element.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split operation on `command.script` results in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function should return `False` to indicate that the command does not match the condition.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version of the function, we first split the `command.script` and check if it has at least two parts. Then, we proceed to check if the second part is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. This modification should address the `IndexError` that was causing the failing tests.
