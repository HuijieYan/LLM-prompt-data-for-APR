### Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the command script contains 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains 'usage:'. The error message is indicating an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that there is an issue with trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

The bug occurs when the command script only contains 'git' without any additional arguments. In this case, splitting the command script by spaces and trying to access index 1 will cause an `IndexError` because there is no index 1 in the list created by splitting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming the command script will always contain at least one additional argument after 'git'. When only 'git' is provided as the script, splitting by spaces will result in a list with only one element ('git') and trying to access index 1 (the second element) will cause an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command script has more than one element before trying to access index 1. If there is not at least one additional argument, we should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the command script by spaces and check if the resulting list has more than one element. Only then, we proceed with checking if index 1 contains 'stash'. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist in the list.
