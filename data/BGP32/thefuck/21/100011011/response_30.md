### Analysis:
- The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr.
- The failing test is asserting the opposite behavior, where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the 'usage:' text.
- The error occurs because the function tries to access the second element of the split script array, causing an IndexError when the script is shorter.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem when the script is only 'git'.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that the script will always have at least two elements when split. This assumption leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element of the array.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to add a check to verify the length of the split script array before trying to access the second element to prevent the IndexError.
- We should also update the condition to match the requirements of the failing test, where the script is 'git' and not 'stash'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making these changes, the function will first check if there are at least two elements in the split script array before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This correction aligns with the requirements of the failing test and should resolve the IndexError.
