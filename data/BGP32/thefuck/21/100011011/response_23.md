### Identification:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute by whitespace and then check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, in cases where the `command.script` attribute does not have a second element, an `IndexError` occurs because of trying to access an index that does not exist.

### Explanation:
The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurred due to the list index being out of range. This happens because when the `command.script` is just `'git'` without any other elements after splitting, there is no second element present in the resulting list. Therefore, trying to access index 1 directly leads to an `IndexError`. This issue is accurately described in the GitHub issue linked.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we check if the list resulting from splitting `command.script` has enough elements before attempting to access index 1. If it does not have enough elements, we should return `False`.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 to ensure that we have enough elements before trying to access index 1. If it is, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. This approach avoids the `IndexError` by first verifying the existence of the index before accessing it.
