### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to check if the second word in the `command.script` attribute is equal to 'stash' and if the term 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr` attribute. The error message indicates that the `list index out of range` error occurs when trying to split `command.script` by whitespaces when the string does not contain enough elements to access the second index.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing `command.script.split()[1]` without checking the length of the resulting list.
2. No handling of cases where the `command.script` may not contain more than one word.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` contains only one word, resulting in a list with just one element when split by whitespace. Accessing index 1 in this scenario leads to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check the length of the list resulting from splitting `command.script` to ensure it has at least two words before accessing the second index.
- Include a condition to handle cases where there might not be sufficient words in the `command.script`.

### Buggy Function - to - Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Updated Explanation:
- The corrected function now first splits `command.script` into a list of words (`script_words`).
- It then checks if the length of this list is greater than 1 to ensure there is at least a second word available.
- By doing this, the corrected version avoids the `IndexError` that occurred in the original buggy function.
