## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is failing with an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element of the list obtained by splitting the `command.script`. This error occurs because the split function is being applied to the entire script, resulting in a single-element list when there are no whitespaces in the script. This behavior is problematic when the script is only "git" and thus the split attempt results in a single-element list.

## Bug Explanation:
In the failing test scenario, the input parameter `command.script` is `git`, and the script attempts to split this string by whitespaces and access the second element, which leads to an IndexError since there is only one element in the resulting list. This scenario highlights an edge case not accounted for in the implementation of the `match` function.

## Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the edge case where the script has no whitespaces. One approach is to check the length of the split list and validate that it has at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError. We can also explicitly check if the script starts with "git stash" to ensure that it is the correct command being checked.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[0] == 'git' 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split script and verifying that it starts with "git stash", we can prevent the IndexError and correctly identify the command.
