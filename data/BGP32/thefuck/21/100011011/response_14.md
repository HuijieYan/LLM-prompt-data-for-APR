### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is expecting the command script to have at least two elements after splitting it, and it checks if the second element is 'stash'. If it doesn't find the second element, it raises an `IndexError`.
- In this case, the input `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in an empty list after splitting. Therefore, accessing the second element of the empty list causes the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the script has at least two elements after splitting before trying to access the second element. If not, we should return False.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
        
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this corrected version, we are first splitting the script into parts and checking if the number of parts is less than 2. If so, we return `False` immediately. Otherwise, we proceed with the original condition to check if the second part is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the command stderr.
