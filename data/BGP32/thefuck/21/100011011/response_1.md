### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the `command.script` does not have enough elements after splitting by whitespace. The function is checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, if there are not enough elements after splitting the command script, it results in an IndexError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `command.script` has only one element (or none) after splitting by whitespace. In such cases, accessing element at index 1 `[1]` will result in an IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements after splitting the command script before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split array or restructuring the condition in a way that doesn't rely on direct index access.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1, we ensure that there are enough elements to check for 'stash' at index 1. This corrected version should resolve the IndexError and pass the failing test.
