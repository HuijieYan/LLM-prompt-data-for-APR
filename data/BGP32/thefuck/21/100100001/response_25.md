The issue with the buggy function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr of the command to determine a match, but the test case is passing a different stderr message (`git_stash_err`) which does not contain 'usage:'. This is causing the function to incorrectly return True when it should have returned False.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `match` function to correctly check for the presence of 'stash' in the command script and 'usage:' in the stderr. 

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function should now correctly identify whether the command is a git stash command with an error message containing 'usage:'. This will ensure that the failing test case `test_not_match` will now pass.
