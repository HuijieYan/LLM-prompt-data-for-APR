## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is a decorator `@git_support` added to it, indicating it is specific to Git commands. The function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.

## Error Location:
The potential error location lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which assumes that there will always be a second word in the command script. If the command script is empty or has only one word, this would cause an 'IndexError'. 

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `split()[1]` is directly accessed without checking the length of the split array. In cases where the command script does not have a second word, it leads to an 'IndexError'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split array has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split array before comparing the second element.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, we first split the command script into words and then check if there are at least two words in the split array before accessing the second word. This would prevent the 'IndexError' and ensure the function works as intended.
