The buggy function `match` is intended to match a specific command and check if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr without considering the actual command.

The potential error location is in the conditional statement of the `match` function where it checks if the command script contains 'stash'. This comparison could be failing if the command script is not properly split.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the command and therefore not properly matching the condition.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the 'stash' command in the script and that the stderr contains 'usage:'. Additionally, we should handle cases where the command script does not have enough elements after splitting.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split command script has at least two parts and then verifies if the second part is 'stash'. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and passes the failing test.
