The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. The potential error in this function lies in the assumption that the second word will always be 'stash', which may not be the case.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking the first word of the command script to ensure it is 'git'. This can lead to incorrect matching if the command script starts with a different word than 'git'.

To fix this bug, we should check if the first word of the command script is 'git' before proceeding with the rest of the conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if the command script has at least 2 parts, then ensures that the first part is 'git' and the second part is 'stash', before finally checking for 'usage:' in the stderr. This ensures a more accurate matching based on the command script provided.
