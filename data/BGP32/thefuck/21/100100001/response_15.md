The bug in the provided function `match` is that it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr to determine a match. However, this logic will not work correctly in all scenarios, especially when the order or position of the words in the command script change. 

To fix the bug, we should check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This approach will be more robust and reliable in identifying the correct scenarios where the rule should match.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function `match` will correctly identify if the command is for stashing changes in git and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. This should address the bug and make the function behave as intended when tested with the failing test provided.
