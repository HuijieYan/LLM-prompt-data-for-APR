## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to match commands related to stash in Git by checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle cases where the second word is not 'stash' or the stderr does not contain 'usage:'.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that the second word in the command is always 'stash' and that 'usage:' is always present in the stderr. If these conditions are not met, the function incorrectly returns True.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the command has multiple words before checking for 'stash' as the second word.
2. Check if 'stash' is a standalone word and not part of another word.
3. Check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr before returning True.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and
            parts[1] == 'stash'
            and any('usage:' in line for line in command.stderr.splitlines()))
```

With the corrected version of the `match` function, the bug is fixed, and it will correctly handle cases where 'stash' is not the second word in the command or 'usage:' is missing from the stderr.
