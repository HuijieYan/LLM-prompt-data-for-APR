The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the input command is related to Git stash and if the stderr contains the usage information. However, there is a bug in the function where it splits the command script and only checks the second part (index 1) if it is 'stash', which is incorrect. It should actually check the first part (index 0) for 'git'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the first part of the script is 'git' and the second part is 'stash'. Additionally, we need to modify the condition to check if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) >= 2 
            and parts[0] == 'git'
            and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks if the command starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
