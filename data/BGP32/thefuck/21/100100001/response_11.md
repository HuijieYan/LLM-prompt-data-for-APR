The bug in the provided function `match` is that it checks for the presence of the string 'stash' in the command script, but it should actually be checking for 'git stash'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation of the bug:
The original code checked for 'stash' in the command script without considering the 'git' prefix that should be present in front of 'stash'. This caused the function to incorrectly match commands that did not start with 'git stash'.

Fix strategy:
- Modify the condition to check if the command script starts with 'git stash' instead of just 'stash'.
- This ensures that only commands starting with 'git stash' are matched correctly.

The corrected version ensures that the function correctly identifies commands starting with 'git stash' and 'usage:' in the stderr, passing the provided failing test.
