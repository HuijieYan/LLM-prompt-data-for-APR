The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, in the failing test, the command being tested is "git" with a stderr message related to 'git stash' instead of just 'stash'.


To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies commands related to 'git stash' by updating the condition to check for both 'git' and 'stash' in the command script and 'usage:' in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script.split() and 'stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function now checks that both 'git' and 'stash' are present in the command script and 'usage:' is in the stderr. This correction should allow the function to correctly match commands related to 'git stash' and pass the failing test.
