The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the test function `test_not_match` is passing a command that does not meet these conditions, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to properly check for the conditions specified in the test function. Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.strip().split()
    if len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == "stash" and "usage:" in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function will split the command script by whitespace, check if the second part is 'stash', and look for 'usage:' in the stderr. If these conditions are met, the function will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_not_match` successfully.
