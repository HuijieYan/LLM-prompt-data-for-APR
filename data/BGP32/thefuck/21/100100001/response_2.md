The buggy function `match` is designed to determine if a git command is related to stashing based on the command input and stderr output. However, the bug lies in the condition that checks if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. This condition is not sufficient to accurately identify if the command is related to stashing.

The fix for this bug involves updating the condition to check if 'stash' is present in the command script, as well as checking for specific error messages related to stashing in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and ('No local changes to save' in command.stderr
                 or 'Saved working directory and index state WIP on' in command.stderr))
```

With this correction, the `match` function now properly checks for 'stash' in the command script and ensures that the stderr contains specific error messages related to stashing. This update should address the bug and allow the failing test `test_not_match` to pass successfully.
