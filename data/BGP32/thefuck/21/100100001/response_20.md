The buggy function is attempting to identify a command that matches the criteria where the second word in the command is 'stash' and the 'usage:' is present in the stderr output. However, the bug lies in the fact that the function is splitting the command script by spaces and directly referencing the second word, without checking if there are more words or ensuring proper error handling.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to split the script by spaces and then check if 'stash' is present in the split command. Additionally, we need to verify that the split command contains more than one word to prevent index out of range errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly check if the command contains 'stash' as the second word and that the 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
