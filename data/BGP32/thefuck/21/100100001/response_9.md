The bug in the provided function `match` is that it only checks if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, it does not account for the possibility of variations in the error message that could indicate the usage information.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `match` function to check if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if any form of 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. We can achieve this by using a case-insensitive comparison to match any variation of 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and any('usage:' in line.lower() for line in command.stderr.split('\n')))
```

With this update, the function now checks for any form of 'usage:' in a case-insensitive manner in the `command.stderr`, ensuring that it can handle variations in the error message. This correction should make the function capable of passing the failing test provided.
