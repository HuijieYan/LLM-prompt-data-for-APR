The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. However, the bug in this function is that it does not handle cases where the command does not contain a second word after 'git'.

The failing test `test_not_match` is failing because the buggy function is assuming that the input command always has a second word after 'git', which is not the case in the test command.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the input command has at least two words before splitting the command. If the command does not have more than one word, then we can directly return False. Otherwise, we can proceed with the existing logic.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the command has more than one word before checking for 'stash' in the second word and 'usage:' in the stderr. This fix should now pass the failing test `test_not_match`.
