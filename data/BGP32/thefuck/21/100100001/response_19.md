The cause of the bug in the `match` function is that it is incorrectly checking for the presence of the string 'usage:' in the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object. However, in the failing test provided, the `stderr` attribute is set to `git_stash_err`, indicating that the expected error message related to `git stash` is different from 'usage:'. This is causing the `match` function to return `True` when it should actually return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `match` function to correctly handle the check for the error message related to `git stash`.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'stash: command not found' in command.stderr)
```

By updating the `match` function to check for the specific error message 'stash: command not found', we ensure that it correctly determines if the command is related to `git stash` and there was an error. This correction will make the failing test pass as expected.
