## Analysis:
1. The `match()` function is supposed to check if a git command is related to stashing based on the command script and error message.
2. The bug seems to be in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where it checks for the second word in the command script to be 'stash'.
3. The failing test is expecting that the `match()` function does not match when the command script does not contain 'stash', but it is failing due to the buggy comparison logic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check the entire command script instead of just the second word for the presence of 'stash'.

## Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

## Updated `match()` function:
- The updated version checks if 'stash' is present anywhere in the command script to match stashing related commands correctly.
- It also verifies the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr to confirm that it is a relevant git command.
- This fix should make the function correctly identify whether a git command is related to stashing.
