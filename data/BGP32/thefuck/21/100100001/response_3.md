## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to determine if a Git command is related to stashing by checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the command script does not have a second word, which can lead to an index out of range error.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. If the `command.script.split()` does not have a second element, it will raise an IndexError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second word in the `command.script`, which is not always the case. This assumption leads to an IndexError when attempting to access the second element in the split list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. Additionally, we should handle cases where the script might not contain the word 'stash' or 'usage:'.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` first before trying to access the second element, we prevent the index out of range error. Additionally, we still check if 'stash' is the second word and if 'usage:' is in the stderr to correctly identify if the command is related to stashing.
