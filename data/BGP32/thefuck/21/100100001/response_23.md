The bug in the `match` function arises from the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but in the failing test, the command script starts with 'git', not 'stash', causing the condition to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to correctly check if the first word in the command script is 'git' and the second word is 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2
            and script_words[0] == 'git'
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly identify if the command is `git stash` and the error message contains 'usage:'.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
