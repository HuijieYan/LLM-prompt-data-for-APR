### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

### Potential Error:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in checking only the second word in the command script. If the command has additional parameters after 'git stash', this check will fail. Additionally, it is only checking for the exact match of 'usage:' in the stderr, which may not cover all possible cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `match` function is too restrictive in its conditions for identifying a match. It does not handle cases where there are additional parameters after 'git stash' or if the 'usage:' message in the stderr is not an exact match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check for 'stash' at any position in the command script and to use a more flexible approach to identify the 'usage:' message in the stderr.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we split the command script into words and check if 'stash' is present in any of the words. This makes the matching more flexible. We also keep the condition for 'usage:' in the stderr the same. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
