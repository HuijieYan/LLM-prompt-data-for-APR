### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the second word in the command.

### Identifying the issue:
The buggy function fails to correctly identify if the second word in the command is 'stash' due to splitting the command by whitespace.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the second word in the command is always the desired keyword ('stash'). This assumption is not valid as there might be multiple whitespace separated words in the command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the command and check if it contains 'stash' as a separate word (not necessarily the second word). We can split the command by whitespace and iterate over the words to find 'stash'.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    for part in command_parts:
        if part == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return True
    return False
```

By iterating over the parts of the command and checking each part if it is 'stash', we can accurately determine if the command contains 'stash' as a separate word.
