The bug in the provided `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr output of the command, but it is not taking into consideration the exact value of the command.split()[1]. This could lead to false positives if there are other commands with 'usage:' in the error message.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to check if the command starts with 'git stash' and then check for the 'usage:' keyword in the stderr.
2. We also need to ensure that the command.split()[1] is 'stash' and not any other random string.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import get_closest

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the command starts with 'git stash', and the second part of the command is 'stash' exactly. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test provided.
