The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command is related to stashing and if the stderr of the command contains the word 'usage:'. However, the bug in this function is that it assumes the second word in the command script (split by whitespace) should be 'stash', which may not always be the case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if 'stash' is present in the command script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This way, we are not assuming the exact position of 'stash' in the command script.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, with this corrected version of the `match` function, it will properly check if 'stash' is present in the git command script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This change should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
