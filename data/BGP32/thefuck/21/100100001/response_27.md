The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the `stderr` of the `Command`, but the `stderr` in the failing test is not actually containing 'usage:' string. This is causing the function to incorrectly return True for a case where it should not.

To fix this bug, we can update the condition in the `match` function to check for the presence of 'fatal:' in the `stderr` instead of 'usage:', as 'fatal:' indicates an error condition in git.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'fatal:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will correctly identify cases where the `stderr` contains 'fatal:' as not a match, which will fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
