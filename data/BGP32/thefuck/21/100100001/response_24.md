The issue with the buggy function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr of the command when matching for a git stash command. However, the test case provided does not have the 'usage:' string in the stderr, causing it to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition in the match function to check for 'fatal:' in the stderr instead of 'usage:'. This is a more appropriate indicator of an error message in the stderr for a failed git stash command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'fatal:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly identify when a git stash command has failed based on the presence of 'fatal:' in the stderr. The provided failing test case should now pass with this corrected version of the function.
