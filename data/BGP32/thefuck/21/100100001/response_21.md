### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a given command is related to the `git stash` command by looking for the word "stash" in the command script and checking if "usage:" is present in the command's stderr. The buggy function is failing a test that expects it to not match a command related to `git stash`.

### Issue:
The bug in the `match` function is the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition is checking the second word in the command script to be 'stash', but if the command is just 'git' without any additional parameters, `command.script.split()` will only have one element and accessing index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before comparing the second word with 'stash'.

### Updated code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By updating the `match` function as shown above, the bug causing the failing test should be fixed, and the function should be able to correctly identify commands related to `git stash`.
