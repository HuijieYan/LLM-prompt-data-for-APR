The bug in the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the `stderr` of the command, but the test case is passing `git_stash_err` as the `stderr` value. Hence, the `match` function will never return True when the test case is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to correctly check for the conditions based on the command input.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the `match` function will now correctly check if the second part of the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `stderr` of the command.

Now, when the failing test case is executed, it should pass with this corrected version of the `match` function.
