## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.
2. The issue arises due to an IndexError when trying to access the second element in the split result of `command.script`.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to assert that the function returns False when given a Command with script equal to 'git' and stderr containing the usage info.
4. The GitHub issue indicates the same IndexError and the fact that the rule fails when the script is just 'git'.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the split function is expecting at least two elements to be present in the command script, but in cases where the script is just 'git', it only has one element. Hence, trying to access index 1 leads to an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split result contains at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. We can also add a check to make sure the script includes 'stash' to satisfy the condition.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of the split_command before trying to access index 1, we prevent the IndexError and ensure that the condition is met only when 'stash' is present in the script and 'usage:' in the stderr.
