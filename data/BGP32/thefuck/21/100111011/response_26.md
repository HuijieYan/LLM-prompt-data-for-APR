### Analysis:
The `match` function is supposed to check if the command script starts with `'git stash'` and if the stderr of the command contains the word `'usage'`. The failing test is checking the scenario where the command script is simply `'git'`, so the split() operation on the script will result in an IndexError since there is no second element.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `match` function where it assumes that the split command script will always have a second element, which leads to an IndexError when the command script is just `'git'`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element. We also need to check for the presence of `'stash'` in the split string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
