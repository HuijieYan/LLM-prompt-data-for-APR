### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a Git command involves stashing and if an error message contains 'usage:'. It tries to split the command script and check if the second part is 'stash'.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the `match` function to return `False` for a Git command that does not involve stashing.
3. The error occurs when the `command.script` does not have enough parts to split into an index of 1, resulting in an `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to verify that the split command has enough parts before checking the second part for 'stash'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the script does not have enough parts after splitting to check the second part for 'stash'. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `match` function to check if the script can be split into at least two parts before checking the second part for 'stash'.
2. Handle cases where the split result is not as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second part, we can prevent the `IndexError`. Also, this corrected version ensures that only commands involving 'stash' are matched with the error message containing 'usage:'.
