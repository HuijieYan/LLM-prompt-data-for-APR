The buggy function `match` is failing because it assumes that the `command.script` will have at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in the failing test case provided, the `command.script` value is just `'git'`, which results in an IndexError when trying to access `split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split operation generates at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) >= 2 
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this implementation, we first split the `command.script` and then check if the split result has at least two elements before comparing the second one with `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function will not encounter an IndexError when accessing the split element.

By applying this fix, the `match` function should now pass the failing test case and address the reported GitHub issue related to the bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule.
