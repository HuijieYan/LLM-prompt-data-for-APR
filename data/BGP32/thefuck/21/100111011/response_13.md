### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command stderr.  
- The failing test `test_not_match` calls the `match` function with a Command object that has the script as `'git'`. This should not match the conditions set in the `match` function.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` which occurs when trying to split the script of the command but there are not enough elements to retrieve the second one.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes there will always be at least two words (elements) in the command script when calling `split()[1]`. When the script is only `'git'`, this results in an `IndexError` as there is only one element after splitting.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains more than one word before trying to access the second word. If the split of the script does not contain at least two elements, we can safely assume that the condition does not match.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before trying to access the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
