Based on the provided information, the issue with the `match` function in `git_fix_stash.py` arises from trying to access an index in a list that is out of range. The code snippet is attempting to split the `command.script` and access the second element, assuming it exists. The error occurs when `command.script` does not contain enough elements to be split into.

To address this issue, a check is needed to verify that `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second one.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The correction ensures that we first split `command.script` into parts and then check if it has at least two elements. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original buggy version.

This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report and make the test case `test_not_match` pass successfully.
