### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The function `match` takes a command object as input and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` asserts that the `match` function should return False when the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains information about git stash.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring at line 8 of the function because the `command.script` is split into words and the index `1` is accessed without proper validation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the rule fails when the script is just 'git'.
  
### Bug Explanation

The bug in the function is caused by assuming that there will always be at least two words in the `command.script`. When the script is just 'git', splitting it does not result in a list with at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is split and checked for the presence of 'stash' only when there are enough words in the script. We can do this by validating the length of the split script before accessing index `1`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing index `1`, we prevent the `IndexError` when the script does not contain enough words. This correction should resolve the bug and ensure the function works as expected.
