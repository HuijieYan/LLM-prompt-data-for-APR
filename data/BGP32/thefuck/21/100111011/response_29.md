### Analysis
From the provided information, the buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the buggy function to not match for a specific input scenario.

The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurs within the `match` function at line 8, suggesting that `command.script.split()` does not have a second element, leading to the index out of range error.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the assumption that `command.script` will always contain multiple words when doing `split()` operation which is not the case when the script is just `'git'`.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function fails in scenarios where the `command.script` contains only one word (e.g., `'git'`) leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second element after splitting. This situation is not handled in the current implementation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should handle the case where the split result has fewer than two elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `words` before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` when there is only one word in `command.script`. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
