To fix the bug in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, we need to address the IndexError that occurs due to an attempt to access index 1 of the split script without checking if it exists. Based on the provided information, the bug causes the script to fail when the first element of the `command.script.split()` list is not present, leading to an out-of-range index error.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version:
- We split the `command.script` into parts and store them in `script_parts`.
- We check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1. This prevents the IndexError.
- We also retain the existing conditions for ensuring the script contains 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'.

This corrected function addresses the issue where the script could fail when the split command was called on a script that did not contain the expected number of parts. By first checking the length of the `script_parts`, we ensure that the index access is safe and prevent the out-of-range error. This correction should make the function pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
