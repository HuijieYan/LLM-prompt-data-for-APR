### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs due to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`.

### Bug:
The bug arises when the `command.script` does not contain at least two words but the function tries to access the second word, causing an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
We need to add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) >= 2 and (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we first split the `command.script` into words and then check if there are at least two words before accessing the second word. This change prevents the IndexError from occurring and fixes the bug.
