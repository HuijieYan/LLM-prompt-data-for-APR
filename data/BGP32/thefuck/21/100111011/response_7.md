### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return False when provided with a `Command` object where `command.script` is "git" and `command.stderr` contains git stash error message.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that `command.script.split()` might be an empty list leading to the attempt to access index 1 causing the error.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the IndexError issue when the script is just "git".

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script.split()` will always contain at least two elements, which is not guaranteed. When the `command.script` is just "git", splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that `command.script.split()` returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in a variable `words`. Then, we check if the length of `words` is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1. This modification ensures that the IndexError is prevented by validating the number of elements in the split list.
