### Error Location
The error is occurring in the `match` function at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. Specifically, the error is caused by trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` list without checking if it exists, leading to an IndexError.

### Cause of the Bug
The `match` function is failing when the `command` object has a `script` value that does not contain at least two elements after splitting. In this case, the `command.script.split()[1]` is causing an IndexError because the split list does not have a second element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split list from `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can check the length of the split list and include a condition to handle cases where the list is too short to access the desired element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_components = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_components) > 1
            and script_components[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the components in `script_components`. We then check if the length of `script_components` is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This approach prevents the IndexError by ensuring that the list has enough elements to access before proceeding.
