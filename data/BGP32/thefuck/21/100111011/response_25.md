## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to identify if the `git` command includes the keyword `stash` in the command script and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the stderr of the command. The error indicator manifests as an IndexError during the attempt to access index `1` of a list obtained by splitting the command script. This occurs when the `git` command is solitary without any additional arguments related to `stash`.

The failing test `test_not_match` aims to assess a scenario where the `git` command is executed without referring to `stash`, leading to a failed assertion due to the unmatched conditions based on the buggy implementation.

Given the error message, it is evident that the issue pertains to the attempt to access an index that doesn't exist in the split list of the script. The `command.script` does not contain the `stash` keyword in such cases, leading to an IndexError.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises because the buggy function assumes the existence of multiple components in the script when only calling `git`, leading to the IndexError when trying to access index `1` in the split script list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To rectify the bug, the function should first confirm that the split script list contains at least two elements before attempting to access index `1` to prevent the IndexError. Additionally, ensuring that the script contains the `stash` keyword is necessary to maintain the intended behavior in identifying relevant `git` commands.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_elements
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, first, we split the `command.script` into its elements, stored in `script_elements`. Then, we check for the presence of `'stash'` within these elements and ensure that `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. This modification ensures that the function handles the scenario where the script only consists of the `git` command appropriately without causing an IndexError.
