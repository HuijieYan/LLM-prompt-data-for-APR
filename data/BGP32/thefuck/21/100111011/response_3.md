The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element in the list obtained from splitting `command.script`, assuming that there is at least one element after splitting. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is only one element after splitting, leading to the IndexError.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `command.script.split()[1]` indexing operation is causing the bug.
- The assumption that the script will have at least two elements after splitting might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The function `match` fails when the `command.script` contains only one element after splitting, as seen in the test case and the provided inputs. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element that doesn't exist.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
A possible solution would be to first check if there are at least two elements after splitting the `command.script`. If not, the function should return `False` to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function first checks if there are at least two elements after splitting the `command.script`. If there are, it then proceeds to check if the second element is `'stash'`, and if `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
