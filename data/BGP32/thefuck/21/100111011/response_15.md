### Analysis
The buggy function `match` aims to check if a git command contains 'stash' and the word 'usage:' in its stderr output. However, the bug occurs when the script is only 'git,' causing an IndexError due to attempting to access index 1 of the split script. This bug leads to the failing test `test_not_match`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from assuming that the script always has at least two elements when split. In this case, when the script is only 'git,' splitting it results in a single-element list, leading to an IndexError when attempting to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the script has at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. We can modify the condition in the `match` function to first check if the split script contains more than one element before comparing the second element to 'stash.'

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_split) > 1 
            and command_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `command_split` before trying to access index 1, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
