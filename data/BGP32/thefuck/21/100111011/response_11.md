### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr includes 'usage:'. The error is due to an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting the command script. This error occurs when the script passed is only 'git', causing the split to return a list with only one element, thus causing the IndexError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where it tries to access the second element of the split list without checking if it exists.

### Bug Cause:
When the command script is just 'git', the split operation creates a list with only one element ('git'), and by trying to access the second element ([1]), it causes an IndexError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the list after splitting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By first checking if the length of `split_script` is equal to or greater than 2 before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and fix the bug.
