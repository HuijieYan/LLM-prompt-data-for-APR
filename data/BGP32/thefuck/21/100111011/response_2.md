The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` parameter will always have at least two elements when using `command.script.split()[1]`. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the `command.script` only contains a single element, as shown in the provided failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that there are at least two elements in the `command.script` before accessing the second element. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split list before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of the split script, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly even when the `command.script` parameter is not formatted as expected. This fix addresses the issue raised in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
