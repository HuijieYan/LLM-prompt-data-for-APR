The bug in the function `match` is due to the assumption that the command script always contains at least two elements after splitting. The bug is triggered when the command script does not have a second element, causing an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to validate if the split command script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that before checking for `'stash'` in the second element of the split script, the function checks if there are at least two elements in the split script to prevent the `IndexError`.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle cases where the command script does not contain enough elements after splitting. This correction should make the failing test `test_not_match` pass.
