## Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` attribute of the `Command` object and access the second element to check if it's equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and splitting it by spaces will result in a list with only one element, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access index 1.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` attribute contains the word `'stash'` rather than splitting and accessing specific indices. This will prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly for cases where the script might not have multiple elements.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By making this change, the function will correctly check if `'stash'` is present in the `command.script` without splitting it, thus addressing the bug and resolving the failing test case.
