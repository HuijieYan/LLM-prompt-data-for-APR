### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the `match` function to return `False` when the `command.script` is `'git'` and the `command.stderr` contains the usage information for `git stash`.
- The error occurs when trying to split `command.script` into a list and accessing the second element, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have at least two words in it. When the `command.script` is 'git', splitting it based on whitespace results in a list with only one element, and accessing the second element (`[1]`) throws an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to make sure that we handle cases where `command.script` has fewer words than expected. One solution could be to check the length of the split list first before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `words` list before trying to access the second element, we ensure that we avoid the `IndexError` when the `command.script` doesn't contain enough words.
