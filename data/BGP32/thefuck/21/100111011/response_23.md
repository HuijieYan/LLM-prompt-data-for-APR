### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script` split by whitespace is equal to 'stash', and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The buggy function fails because when the `command.script` is only 'git', splitting it results in a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test `test_not_match` provides `Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err)` which sets `command.script` to 'git' and `command.stderr` with the git stash usage information. When running the buggy function, `command.script.split()[1]` is executed, but since splitting 'git' results in a list with only one element, accessing the second element causes an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the length of the split `command.script` list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

### Code Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version checks if the length of the split `command.script` list is greater than 1 and then compares the second element to 'stash'. This fix avoids the `IndexError` when the split list has only one element.
