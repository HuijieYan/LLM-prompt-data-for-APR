## Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug is caused by trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`, which results in an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`. To fix this, we need to check if the split command's length is at least 2 before indexing into it.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script is just `'git'`, as seen in the failing test case. This modification ensures that the function works correctly even when the script length is less than 2.
