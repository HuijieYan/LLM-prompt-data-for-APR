### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command issued is related to git stash and if there is an 'usage:' string in the stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the `match` function does not match for a particular case where the stderr includes the git stash usage information.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which occurs when trying to access an invalid index while splitting the `command.script`.
4. The runtime values show that the `command.script` is simply `'git'` and there is a detailed git stash usage information in the `command.stderr`, causing the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `match` is assuming that the `command.script` will always have a second element to check against 'stash' without verifying the length of the split list. When the `command.script` is only `'git'`, accessing index 1 in the split list results in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first verify if the split `command.script` has at least 2 parts before proceeding to check if the second part is 'stash'. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the bug.
