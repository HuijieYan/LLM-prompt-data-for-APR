## Analysis
- The `match` function takes a `Command` object as input, where the `script` attribute is used to determine if the command is related to `git stash` based on the second element in the split script.
- The function checks if the second element in the script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `stderr` attribute of the `Command` object.
- The failing test `test_not_match` tries to assert that the `match` function does not match a command where the script does not contain 'stash' but the `stderr` contains 'usage:'.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs due to the assumption that the script will always contain at least two elements after splitting. When the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments related to `stash`, splitting it and trying to access the second element results in an `IndexError`.

## Proposed Fix
- To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element to check if it is 'stash'.
- We can also check if the command script starts with 'git stash' to ensure it is a stash-related command.
- Additionally, we should verify that 'usage:' is present in the `stderr` to correctly identify the `git stash` related commands.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the script first, check if the length is at least 2 and the first element is 'git', then we compare the second element to 'stash' and verify 'usage:' in the `stderr`. This correction ensures that the function correctly identifies commands related to `git stash` without throwing any errors.
