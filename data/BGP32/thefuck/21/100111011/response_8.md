### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word since the index `[1]` produces an `IndexError` in such cases. This error leads to the failing test and results in the function not matching the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming the presence of a second word in `command.script` without verifying it, causing an `IndexError` when the assumption is not met. This triggers the failing test and the corresponding error message.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that `command.script` is split into words before accessing the second word to avoid the `IndexError`. Additionally, we should check the length of the split list to ensure it has at least 2 elements. By incorporating these checks, we can prevent the index error and make the function more robust.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split `command.script` into `script_words` first and then check if it has a length greater than 1 before comparing the second word to `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function will not throw an `IndexError` and should resolve the failing test.
