### Error Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- The failing test `test_not_match` tries to match the command `"git"` with stderr containing `git_stash_err`.
- In the provided runtime values, we see that the `command.script` in the failing test is just `'git'`, which will cause an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second word in an empty list after splitting.
- The cause of the bug is that the `match` function assumes there will always be at least two words in `command.script`, which is not the case for the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Since the buggy function assumes there will be at least two words in `command.script`, there should be a check to ensure that before trying to access the second word.
- Additionally, it might be beneficial to check if `'stash'` is explicitly provided in the command script to avoid false matches with other commands that might include the word `'stash'` elsewhere.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We first split the `command.script` into words.
- Then, we check if there are at least two words in the script, and the second word is `'stash'`.
- We also verify if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- If all conditions are met, we return `True`, otherwise `False`.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for the test case provided.
