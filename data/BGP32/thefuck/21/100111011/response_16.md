## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match commands where the script starts with `'git'` and the second part is `'stash'`, and the stderr contains `'usage:'`. However, the bug is caused by assuming that the script will always contain at least two parts split by whitespace, leading to an IndexError when attempting to access the second part.

### Error Location
The error occurs in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
because it assumes that the split command script will have at least two elements.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to fail when the script does not have at least two parts, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the script has more than one part before trying to access the second part.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the script into parts and then check if the number of parts is greater than or equal to 2 before comparing the second part to 'stash'. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` by checking the length of the split script first.
