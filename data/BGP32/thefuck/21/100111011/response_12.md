### Buggy Function Analysis
Based on the provided information, the buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is supposed to check if the command script contains `'stash'` and if the stderr output contains `'usage:'`. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the function should not match for a specific `Command` instance with stderr containing the git stash error message. The error occurs due to an `IndexError` when attempting to split the script.

### Error Location
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The `IndexError` happens when trying to access index 1 of the result of `split()` on `command.script`, meaning that the `command.script` only contains a single element after splitting.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `command.script` only contains the script name (`git` in this case) without any arguments. Thus, attempting to split this single element results in a list with only one element, and accessing index 1 throws an `IndexError`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should first check if splitting the script results in more than one element before trying to access an index. We can also improve the condition to check if the script starts with `git stash` instead of directly comparing the split result to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By implementing this corrected version, the function first checks if splitting the script results in more than one element before proceeding to access index 1. This modification should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as intended.
