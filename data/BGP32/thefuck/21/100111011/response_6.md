### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command matches `'git stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the function does not match a specific Command instance. The error occurs at `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]` due to an `IndexError`.

### Bug:
The bug arises from assuming that the `command.script.split()` list will always have at least two elements, leading to an attempt to access the second element `[1]` where none may exist, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second index. We can also simplify the detection logic to improve readability and prevent unnecessary index checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
