### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the given command is related to `git stash` and has the error message `usage:` in stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a test case where the command script is just `"git"` and the stderr contains the git stash error message.
3. The error occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to split `command.script` to access the second element.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same `IndexError` problem when the input script is just `"git"`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be a second element in the split command script. When the script is just `"git"`, trying to access the second element results in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where the split command script does not contain the expected number of elements. We can first check if the command script has sufficient elements before trying to access the desired element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we split the command script first and then check if it has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This change will prevent the `IndexError` when splitting a script that does not have enough elements.
