### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command contains `stash` as the second word and if `'usage:'` is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` attempts to verify that the `match` function does not return True when the stderr contains the git stash error message.
3. The error occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting the command script.
4. The GitHub issue explains that the rule fails when the script is just `git`, which aligns with the error message we have.
5. The fix should involve checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element to prevent the IndexError.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that when the script is just `git`, the split function returns a list of length 1, and attempting to access the second element (`[1]`) results in an `IndexError`. This explains the failing test and the error message observed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element to handle cases where the script does not have the required word at the expected index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By incorporating the check for the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError and ensure that the function works correctly for all cases.
