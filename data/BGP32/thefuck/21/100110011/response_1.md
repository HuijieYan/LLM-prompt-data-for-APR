### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error in the function occurs in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This line is trying to split the script attribute of the Command object using whitespaces and access the 2nd element in the split list. However, if the Command object only contains 'git' as the script, it will lead to an IndexError as there won't be a second element in the split list.

### Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug is caused when the match function is executed with a Command object that contains only 'git' as the script. The function tries to access the 2nd element of the split command script, leading to an IndexError because there is only one element in the split list.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should check the length of the split script list before trying to access the 2nd element. If the length of the split list is less than 2, we can safely assume that 'stash' is not present after 'git' in the script.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script and store it in a variable. Then, we check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before comparing the 2nd element to 'stash' and checking if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This modification prevents the IndexError when accessing the split elements.
