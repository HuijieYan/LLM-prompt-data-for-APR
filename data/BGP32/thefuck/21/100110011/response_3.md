### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command involves stashing by comparing the second word of the command with 'stash' and confirming the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. The bug occurs due to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command script.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` verifies that the `match` function returns False when provided with a Command object related to git without any mention of stashing.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is caused by an IndexError due to trying to access an index that is out of range within the split command script.
4. To fix the bug, we should validate the length of the split command script before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.
5. The corrected version of the function `match` is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the split command script contains at least 2 elements (`len(words) > 1`), we prevent the IndexError from occurring. This fix ensures that the function operates correctly even when the git command is not related to stashing.
