### 1. Analyzing the bug
The buggy function `match` is intended to check whether the command is related to `git stash` by looking for the keyword 'stash' in the command script and 'usage:' in the command's stderr. The specific failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return false for a command without 'stash' in the script and with 'usage:' in the stderr.

The failing test is failing with an `IndexError` stating that the list index is out of range in the `command.script.split()[1]` statement.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the bug is occurring due to the script being just 'git', which results in an empty list after splitting by whitespace.

### 2. Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is the usage of index `[1]` on the result of `command.script.split()`, which assumes the presence of at least one element after splitting.

### 3. Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments, causing an empty list when split by spaces. As a result, trying to access index `[1]` in an empty list raises an `IndexError`.

### 4. Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the script doesn't contain any additional arguments after 'git'. We can modify the condition to first check if the split command has enough elements before accessing index `[1]`.

### 5. Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

By checking if the `script_parts` list has more than one element before accessing index `[1]`, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the script contains only 'git'. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
