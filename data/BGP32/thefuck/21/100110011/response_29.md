### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command contains the word 'stash' as the second argument and if the error message contains 'usage:'. The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the `match` function does not incorrectly match when provided with a command that does not mention 'stash' as the second argument.

The failing test provides the error message indicating that an `IndexError` occurred at line 8 of the buggy function `git_fix_stash.py`. This error occurs when trying to access an index in a list that is out of range.

The GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" also highlights this bug and provides additional details and traceback information related to the error.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs when attempting to split the command script and access the second element using `command.script.split()[1]` in the `match` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `script` attribute of the `command` object does not contain enough arguments to split into multiple elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access index `1` from the resulting list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if splitting the script into elements results in at least two elements before trying to access index `1`. This can be achieved by checking the length of the list resulting from `split()`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `script_elements` and ensuring it is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly with the provided failing test and address the issue raised on GitHub.
