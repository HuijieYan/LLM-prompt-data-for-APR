### Potential Error Locations:
1. The buggy function tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if it has at least 2 elements.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function assumes that `command.script.split()` will always contain at least two elements, with 'stash' being the second element. However, in the failing test scenario, `command.script` is only 'git', causing `command.script.split()` to have only one element. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it doesn't, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function that addresses the issue:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
```

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `command.script.split()` in a variable `split_script`. Then we check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This modification ensures that the function will not raise an `IndexError` when the split script doesn't have enough elements.
