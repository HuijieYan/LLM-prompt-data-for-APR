### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. This function seems to be designed to match commands related to Git stashes.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to assert that the buggy function does not match when the stderr of the command contains a git stash error message.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring at `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` because the split operation results in an empty list, and trying to access the second element throws an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the split operation results in an empty list to prevent the IndexError.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused when the `script` attribute of the `Command` is simply "git" and does not contain additional words to split. This leads to an empty list being returned when splitting the script and accessing its second element.

### Bug Fix
We can fix the bug by first checking if the length of the split result is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can consider the match as False.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version should handle the edge case where the `split_script` list has less than 2 elements and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
