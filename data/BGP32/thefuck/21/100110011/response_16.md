### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains `'stash'` and if the stderr includes `'usage:'`. However, when the script is just `'git'` without any arguments, the `.split()` method raises an `IndexError` because there are no elements to split.
2. The failing test is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when the command is just `'git'`.
3. The error message indicates that the `IndexError: list index out of range` is coming from trying to access index `[1]` for a list with no elements (an empty list) when the command is just `'git'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script does not contain any arguments properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the split command has at least one element before checking for the string `'stash'`.
2. Handle the case where the split command does not have any elements by returning `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) < 2:  # Check if there are at least 2 parts
        return False  # Return False if there are no arguments
    
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the index `[1]`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
