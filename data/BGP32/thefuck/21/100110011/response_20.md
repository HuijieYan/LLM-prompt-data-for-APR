### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. The error is occurring because it assumes there will always be at least two elements in the split result of the command script, which is not true in the failing test.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is passing a command without the word 'stash', so the split result of the script only has one element, causing the index out of range error.
3. The failing test output shows the `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the script split result does not have a second element when trying to access index 1.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing index 1.


### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the split result of the command script will always have at least two elements, resulting in an index out of range error when it doesn't. The failing test intentionally provides a command script without 'stash' to trigger this error.


### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split result contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the index out of range error when the command script does not contain 'stash'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the index out of range error is avoided, and the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue in GitHub.
