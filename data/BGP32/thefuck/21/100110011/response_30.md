### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` asserts that the `match` function should return False when provided with a `Command` object with the stderr containing 'usage:' but the command script not containing 'stash'.
3. The error occurs in the buggy function at the line `command.script.split()[1]`, where an `IndexError` is raised if the script does not contain multiple words.
4. The reported GitHub issue also highlights the same `IndexError` when the `command.script.split()[1]` is accessed.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming the availability of a second word in the command script by splitting it using whitespaces. If the script is just 'git' without any parameters, then accessing the index 1 of the split list raises an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should first check the length of the split script to ensure it has at least two words before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing index 1, we can avoid the `IndexError`. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
