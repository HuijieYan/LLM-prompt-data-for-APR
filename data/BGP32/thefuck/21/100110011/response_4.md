### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains `stash` and the stderr contains `usage:`.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the `match` function returns `False` when a `Command` object is created with the stderr containing `git_stash_err`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the buggy function at line 8 when trying to access the second element of the split command script.
- The GitHub issue also mentions the same `IndexError` issue with the `git_fix_stash` rule.

### Potential Error:
- The potential error is in trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function tries to access the second element of the split command script assuming it exists, leading to an IndexError when the script is just `git`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the split script parts before accessing the second element, we ensure that the buggy function doesn't throw an `IndexError` when the split script parts are less than 2.
