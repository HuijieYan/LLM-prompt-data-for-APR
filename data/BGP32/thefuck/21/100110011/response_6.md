### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is checking if the second word in the entered command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. From the failing test `test_not_match`, we can see that the `match` function should not match when the stderr contains the usage information for `git`.
3. The bug is causing an `IndexError` because the `split()` function is used without checking if it actually splits the command into multiple words. When the command is just 'git', it results in a single-element list which raises an error when trying to access the second element.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script has multiple words before trying to access the second word. Additionally, we should ensure that the command is related to `git stash` and not just `git`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_words) > 1 
            and command_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version of the function first checks if the command has more than 1 word before trying to access the second word. It ensures that the command is related to `git stash` and it avoids the `IndexError` by validating the split result.
