### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is checking if the second word of the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the stderr. 
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when the command script does not contain 'stash'.
3. The error message shows an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the buggy function due to trying to access index 1 of the split command script when it might not have any element at that index as per the failing test.
4. The GitHub issue also confirms this bug, stating that the rule fails when the script is just 'git'.
5. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the command script does not have the required number of elements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `split()` function returns a list with fewer elements than expected, causing the `IndexError` when trying to access an element at index 1 which does not exist.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has enough elements before accessing index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly even when the script does not contain the required words.
