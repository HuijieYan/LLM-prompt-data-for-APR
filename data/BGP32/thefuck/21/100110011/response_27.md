### Analysis:
1. **Issue**: The `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is throwing an `IndexError` when the `git` command is passed without any arguments.
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the line `command.script.split()[1]` when trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.
3. **Cause of the Bug**: The bug happens because the function assumes that there will always be a second element after splitting the command script, leading to an `IndexError` when the script is just `git` without any additional arguments.
4. **Fixing Strategy**: We need to first check if there are enough elements in the split array before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By this correction, we ensure that the `split_script[1]` is accessed only when there are enough elements in the split command script, preventing the `IndexError` and allowing the function to work correctly.
