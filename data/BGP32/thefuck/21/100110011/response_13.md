### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `match` function when attempting to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. The error arises when the script contains only "git" without any additional arguments passed. This results in an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the split list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split list before attempting to access the second element. We should also ensure that the script command starts with "git stash" to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
