### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is failing because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script, but when the script is just 'git', the split will return only one element causing an IndexError.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return False when the command is 'git' and the stderr contains 'usage:' message.
3. The bug causes the failing test to encounter an IndexError because of trying to access the second element in a split that does not contain it. This error is consistent with the GitHub issue description.
4. To fix the bug, the `match` function needs an additional condition to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element.

### Revised Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of the split script before accessing the second element, the bug causing the IndexError is resolved. This modification ensures that the function will only try to access the second element if it exists, preventing the IndexError scenario.
