### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check whether the command script contains 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'. 
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the match function to return False when given a command object that does not meet the criteria.
3. The error occurs at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where an `IndexError` is raised because the split method on an empty script list does not have an index of 1.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the script is empty before attempting to split it.
5. We should modify the `match` function to first check if the script is non-empty before splitting it and comparing elements.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
