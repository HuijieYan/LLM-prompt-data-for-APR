### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the given command relates to the 'git stash' operation and if the stderr of the command contains the string 'usage:'. The bug is occurring due to an `IndexError` in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` when the script is just 'git'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the script by whitespace, but this assumption fails when the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the length of the split list before attempting to access the second element.
2. Update the condition to check if 'stash' is at index 1 only when the split list has at least 2 elements.
3. Add an additional condition to check if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By updating the condition to check the length of `script_parts` and accessing the second element only if it exists, we ensure that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
