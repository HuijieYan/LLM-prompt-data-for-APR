### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the `command.script` contains the word 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` asserts that the `match` function should return `False` when provided with a `Command` object with specific `stderr` content.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py` line 8, which suggests that the `split()` method on an empty list is causing the issue.
4. The GitHub issue confirms this bug, stating that the rule fails when `command.script` is just `'git'`, which doesn't have the required information for splitting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always contain multiple words to be split, resulting in an empty list when split on an empty string.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` is not empty before attempting to split it. If it is empty, the function should return `False` immediately without any further comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script:
        return False
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check to ensure that `command.script` is not empty before proceeding with splitting it, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring in the corrected version of the function.
