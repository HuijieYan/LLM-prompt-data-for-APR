### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is a decorator `@git_support`, and it checks if the script in the git command contains 'stash' as the second word and if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'. 
2. The failing test `test_not_match` creates a Command object with the script 'git' and checks if the match function returns False.
3. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 8 of `git_fix_stash.py` which is due to trying to access the second element of the output of `command.script.split()` when the split list has less than 2 elements.
4. To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `command.script` does not always contain 'stash' as the second word, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that does not exist in the split list.

### Fix Strategy:
Check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring before.
