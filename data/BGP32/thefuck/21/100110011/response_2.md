### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in accessing the second element of the split command without checking if it exists. If the command script does not have a second element, an IndexError will occur.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function tries to access the second element of the split command script without verifying its existence. This leads to an IndexError when the script is just "git" without any additional arguments. The failing test demonstrates this by passing a Command object with "git" as the script and the provided error message as stderr, triggering the IndexError.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the script has more than one element before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element of the split command script is "git" to validate that it is indeed a 'git stash' command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By performing these checks before accessing specific elements in the script, we can avoid the IndexError and correctly match "git stash" commands with the provided usage message.
