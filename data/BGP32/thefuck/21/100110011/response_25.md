### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is expected to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the command script and error message.
2. The buggy function has an issue with `IndexError: list index out of range` due to splitting an empty script.
3. The failing test is `test_not_match()`, where it asserts that the buggy function should not match a specific command related to `git stash`.
4. The error occurs because the `command.script` is empty, causing the `split()` function to result in an empty list.
5. The GitHub issue "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" provides details on the issue and error trace.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the script contains any elements before splitting it to prevent the `IndexError`.
2. Update the `match` function to include a check for the script length before accessing the index.
3. Return False if the script doesn't contain multiple parts or doesn't match the condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index `1`, we prevent the `IndexError` when splitting an empty script. This corrected version will resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
