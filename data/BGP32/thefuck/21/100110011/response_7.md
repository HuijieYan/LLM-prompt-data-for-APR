## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The bug is due to directly accessing the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if it exists.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is supposed to assert that the `match` function does not match a command where the stderr contains the error message related to `git stash`.
3. The error occurs because when the `command.script.split()` result is empty, trying to access the second element raises an `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that there are at least two elements in the `command.script.split()` result before trying to access the second element.

## Proposed Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` to be at least 2 before trying to access `script_parts[1]`, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the list is empty.
