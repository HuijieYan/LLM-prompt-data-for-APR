### Analysis:
1. The `match` function checks if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
2. The error occurs when the command script does not start with 'git stash' but the function still tries to split the script.
3. The error message indicates an IndexError in the `match` function, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]`.
4. The GitHub issue also confirms this error when the script is just 'git', causing the index out of range error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming the script always starts with 'git stash' without performing a boundary check before accessing the split elements. When the script is not 'git stash', trying to access the element at index 1 will result in an IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Add a check before accessing the split element to ensure the script starts with 'git stash'.
2. If the script does not start with 'git stash', return False immediately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script
    if not script.startswith('git stash'):
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
