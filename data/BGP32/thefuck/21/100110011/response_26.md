### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is utilizing the `split()` method on the command script without checking if the script has enough elements to split. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that does not exist.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the buggy function should not match a certain command, but due to the bug, it fails with an `IndexError`.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the issue is an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file at line 8.
4. The GitHub issue titled `git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git` highlights the same issue of the rule failing when the script is just `git` without any other elements to split.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function in a way that it correctly verifies the conditions without raising an `IndexError`. We can check first if the script has enough elements to be split, and then proceed with the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version of the `match` function first splits the script into elements and then checks if there are more than one element and if the second element is `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the script won't encounter an `IndexError` and will provide the correct matching logic.
