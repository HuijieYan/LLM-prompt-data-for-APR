### Analysis:
1. The function `match` is checking if the second word from the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to match a command with 'git' script and a stderr with git stash error message.
3. The error occurs because the script 'git' does not have a second word, causing an `IndexError` when using `command.script.split()[1]`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the script does not contain multiple words.

### Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By splitting the command script into words and checking if the list has more than one element before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` when the script has only one word.
