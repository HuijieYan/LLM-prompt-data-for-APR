### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return False when given a `Command` object with stderr containing `git_stash_err`.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` on line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, suggesting that the split operation on `command.script` is resulting in an empty list, leading to the index out of range error.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when the script is just 'git' and provides the output of the git command where 'usage:' is present in stderr.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is being caused by the assumption that there will always be at least two words in `command.script` after splitting. When the script is just 'git', and 'stash' is not present, the split operation results in an empty list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation results in a list with at least two items before attempting to access index 1. If the split results in an empty list, we can be sure that the condition will never be met, so we can directly return False in such cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By introducing a check for the length of the split result before accessing index 1, the corrected version of the `match` function ensures that the index out of range error is avoided in cases where the split result is empty. This will now allow the function to handle cases where the script is just 'git' without causing an error.
