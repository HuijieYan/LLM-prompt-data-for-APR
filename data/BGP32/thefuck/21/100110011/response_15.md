### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is expecting a command where the second word in `script` should be 'stash', and the `stderr` should contain the word 'usage:'.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the `match` function, specifically in the expression `command.script.split()[1]`.
3. The failing test is testing the scenario where the `script` is 'git' and `stderr` contains git stash error message. This is causing the `IndexError` as there is no second element after splitting 'git'.
4. The bug is that the `match` function is assuming that the `script` will always have a second word, which is not the case when the `script` is just 'git'. A strategy to fix this would be to first check if there are enough elements after splitting before accessing elements in a list.
  
### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version first checks if there are more than one word in the `script` before accessing the word at index 1. This prevents the `IndexError` when the `script` is not sufficient.
