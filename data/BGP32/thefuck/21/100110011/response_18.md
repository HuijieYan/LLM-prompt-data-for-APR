### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is a `git_support` function that checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a Command object with just "git" as the script and a git error message with 'usage:' in it.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function tries to split the script using spaces and access the second element, which results in an IndexError when the script has only one word.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the script has fewer words than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check the length of the script split before accessing index 1 to avoid an IndexError.
- Return False if the split script doesn't contain the expected number of elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By adding a check for the length of `script_words` before accessing index 1, we prevent the IndexError and ensure that the function returns False when the script doesn't match the expected criteria.
