### Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the provided test is calling the function with a command that does not exactly match the conditions for a match, causing the test to fail.

### Bug:
The buggy function is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the provided test case because the command script does not contain 'stash'.

### Fix:
Update the match function to check if 'stash' is in the command script instead of comparing it directly with the second word. This will ensure that 'stash' can be matched anywhere in the script instead of just the second word.

### Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
