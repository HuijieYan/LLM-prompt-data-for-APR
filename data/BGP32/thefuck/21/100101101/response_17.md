The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This logic is incorrect as it does not accurately match the intended condition.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the stderr. This will ensure that the function accurately matches the conditions for fixing the stash command error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected implementation accurately checks if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the stderr, which aligns with the expected behavior.
