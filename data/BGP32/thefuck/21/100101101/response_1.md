The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr` without taking into consideration the possibility of multiple lines being present in the `command.stderr`. As a result, the condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` might not accurately detect the intended scenario.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic to check for 'usage:' within each line of the `command.stderr`. If any line contains 'usage:', we should consider it a match.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and 
            command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and
            any('usage:' in line for line in command.stderr.splitlines()))
```

By splitting `command.stderr` into lines using `splitlines()` and then checking if 'usage:' is present in any line, we address the issue with the original implementation.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
