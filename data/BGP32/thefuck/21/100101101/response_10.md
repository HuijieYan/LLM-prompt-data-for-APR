### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function occurs because the function is checking if the second element of the split script is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. However, in the failing test case, the script does not contain the word 'stash', causing the condition to evaluate to False and the function to return False, which is incorrect. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to check if the script contains 'git stash' anywhere in the command instead of just checking the second word. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies commands related to 'git stash'.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this change, the `match` function should now pass the failing test case and correctly identify commands related to 'git stash'.
