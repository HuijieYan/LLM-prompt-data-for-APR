### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command if the command's script contains the word "stash" and the stderr of the command contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation is checking if the second word in the script is "stash", which is causing it to fail the provided test.

### Error location in the buggy function

The issue lies in the following line of code:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code snippet is splitting the script by spaces and checking if the second element is 'stash'. This is not the correct condition to check for the word 'stash' in the script.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the buggy function is incorrectly checking for the word 'stash' at the second position in the split script, which is not the actual position of the word 'stash'. This mismatch in condition is causing the function to fail when analyzing commands that should match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to correctly check if the script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. We should not rely on the position of words in the split script.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:', which aligns with the expected behavior.
