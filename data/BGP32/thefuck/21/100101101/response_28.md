### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the error message provided in the test case contains an additional new line character at the beginning. This causes the buggy function to fail because it doesn't strip the new line character while comparing the error message.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the buggy function to check for 'usage:' in the command.stderr after removing any leading or trailing white spaces and new line characters.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.strip())
``` 

By using the `strip()` method on `command.stderr`, we ensure that any leading or trailing white spaces or new line characters are removed before comparing the error message. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
