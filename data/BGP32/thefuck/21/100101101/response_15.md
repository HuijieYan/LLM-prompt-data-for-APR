## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test case, the `stderr` contains the expected usage message for the `git stash` command, and the script is 'git'. The current implementation of the `match` function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition within the `match` function to ensure that it correctly checks for the 'stash' command and the presence of 'usage:' in the `stderr`. We will update the condition to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr which corresponds to the 'git stash' command.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By updating the condition in the `match` function to check for 'stash' in the command script instead of at a specific position, we fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly identifies the 'git stash' command. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
