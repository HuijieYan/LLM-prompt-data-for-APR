### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to determine if the `git` command is related to stashing by checking if the second word in the command is `stash` and if the word `usage:` is in the stderr. However, the current implementation of splitting the script by whitespace and checking the second word is causing the bug. This is because the actual command might have multiple words separated by whitespace resulting in an incorrect comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the command starts with `git stash` instead of just comparing the second word. This way, we ensure that the command is specifically related to stashing.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
