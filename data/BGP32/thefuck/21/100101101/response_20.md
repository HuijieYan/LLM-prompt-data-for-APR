## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the condition is not correctly checking if the 'stash' word is actually a valid git command. In the provided test case, the `stderr` contains the expected help message for the `git stash` command, but the buggy function fails to recognize it as a correct match.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` corresponds to a valid git command, in this case 'git stash', and then check if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. We can modify the condition to explicitly check for 'git stash' at the beginning of `command.script` and then check for the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
