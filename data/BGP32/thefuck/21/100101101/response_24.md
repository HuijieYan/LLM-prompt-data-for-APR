### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is 'git', and the stderr contains the usage information related to the 'git stash' command. This causes the function to incorrectly return True when it should not.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the match function to check if the script contains 'git stash' instead of just 'stash' and also check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This will ensure that the function only matches when the git stash command is used.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
