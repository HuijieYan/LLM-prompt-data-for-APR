### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command's script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command's script is `'git'` and the stderr contains the git stash usage information. The function does not account for this scenario and incorrectly identifies it as a match.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check if 'stash' is in the command's script instead of explicitly checking for it as the second word. This will make the function more robust and accurately identify the match condition.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
