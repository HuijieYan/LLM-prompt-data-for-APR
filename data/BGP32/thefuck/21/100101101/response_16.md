### Bug Explanation
The buggy function's current implementation checks if the second element in the split script of the command is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. However, the provided test case expects the function to not match, meaning it should return False. In this case, the command's script is 'git' and the command's stderr contains the usage information for git stash, which should not match the condition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the `match` function so that it returns False for the given test case where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage information for git stash.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the script is 'git' and the stderr contains 'git stash'
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function now correctly checks for the presence of 'stash' in the script and 'usage: git stash' in the stderr, which should pass the failing test.
