### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, the test case provided has `command.script` as `'git'` and the `command.stderr` includes the usage message of `git stash`. This causes the condition to evaluate to `False` and the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the second word of the command script instead of the first word. Additionally, the condition to check for `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr` is also incorrect.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly check the first word of the command script and ensure that the usage message `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By fixing the function to check the first word of the command script and searching for `'usage:'` in the `stderr`, the function should now pass the failing test case.
