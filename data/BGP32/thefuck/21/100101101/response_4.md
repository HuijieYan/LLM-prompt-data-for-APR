The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the test case provided expects the function to not match when the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains information about git stash commands.

The bug in the function is that it directly compares the second word in the command script with 'stash', which will always fail since it is comparing 'git' with 'stash'. We need to update the function to correctly handle this case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the command script starts with 'git' and if 'stash' is present in the script. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_words and 'stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will match correctly when the command script has 'git' and 'stash' in it, and the stderr contains information about git stash commands.
