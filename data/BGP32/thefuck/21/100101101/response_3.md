The issue with the current implementation is that the `split()` method is being called on the entire command script, which is only checking the first word of the script. This leads to the comparison always failing because 'stash' is not the first word in the command script.

To fix this issue, we need to split the command script correctly and then check if 'stash' is one of the words in the splitted script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.strip().split()
    return 'stash' in split_script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By splitting the script correctly and checking if 'stash' is in the list of split words, we ensure that the comparison is done accurately.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
