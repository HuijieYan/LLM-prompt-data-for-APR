The bug in the current implementation lies in the comparison in the return statement of the`match` function. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is checking if the second item in the list generated by splitting `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`, which will cause an index out of range error if there is no second item in the list.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the buggy function does not encounter index out of range errors and correctly matches the required conditions.
