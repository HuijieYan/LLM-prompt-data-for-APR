The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of the string 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`, but the provided `command.stderr` contains a newline character at the beginning, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the `command.stderr` before checking for the presence of 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.strip())
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly match the provided test case and pass the failing test.
