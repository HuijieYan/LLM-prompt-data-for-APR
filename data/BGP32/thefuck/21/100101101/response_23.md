## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is caused by the incorrect condition for matching. The current implementation checks if the second part of the split script is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the provided test case expects that the function should not match, but the condition in the function always returns `True` as it only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr which is present in the test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to check if the second part of the split script is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is *not* in the stderr. This way, the function will only match when 'stash' is in the command and 'usage:' is not present in the stderr.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' not in command.stderr)
```
