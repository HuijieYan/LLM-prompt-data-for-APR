### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is caused by incorrect comparison logic. The function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, the `command.script` in the failing test contains only `'git'` and the `command.stderr` contains the usage message related to `git stash` commands. Therefore, the current implementation fails to detect a match.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `match` function to look for the specific usage message related to the `git stash` command in the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking if the specific usage message 'usage: git stash' is present in the `command.stderr`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly identify a match when dealing with `git stash` commands.
