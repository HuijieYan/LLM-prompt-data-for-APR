The bug in the provided function is that it is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash', instead of the first word. This causes the function to not match the command properly and leads to failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check the first word in the command instead of the second word.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the first word in the command is 'git' and the 'usage:' is present in the stderr, which aligns with the expected behavior.
