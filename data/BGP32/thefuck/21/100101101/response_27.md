The bug in the provided function is that it checks if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. The condition should include both checks being true to correctly determine a match.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By including the check for the length of the split script to be greater than 1, we ensure that the second element exists before comparing it with 'stash'. This correction should now pass the failing test.
