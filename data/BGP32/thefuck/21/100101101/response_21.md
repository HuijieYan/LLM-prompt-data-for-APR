The bug in the current implementation of the `match` function is that it checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the test case provided expects the function to not match when the stderr contains the usage message related to git stash.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation only checks for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command script without considering the context in which it appears.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to ensure that it does not match when the stderr contains the usage message related to git stash.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (
        command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage: git stash' not in command.stderr
    )
```

With this fix, the function will not match when the stderr contains the usage message related to git stash, as expected in the provided test case.
