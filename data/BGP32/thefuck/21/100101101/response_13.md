### Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. However, based on the provided test case and runtime values, the `command.script.split()[1]` will actually return 'stash' which equals the expected value, but the `command.stderr` doesn't contain the exact string 'usage:', it has 'usage: ' (notice the extra space).

### Bug:
The buggy function is checking for 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`, but it should be checking for 'usage: ' (with a space at the end).

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check for 'usage: ' in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage: ' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should pass the provided failing test.
