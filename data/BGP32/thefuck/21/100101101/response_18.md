### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the stderr. However, the condition is not checking the full stderr for the usage message pattern, leading to a false negative result. 

### Fix Strategy
Modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the entire stderr contains the 'usage:' keyword. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies when the stderr contains the expected message.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
