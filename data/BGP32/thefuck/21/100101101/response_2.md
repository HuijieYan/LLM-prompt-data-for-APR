### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is due to how the condition is being checked. The function is splitting the `command.script` by spaces and then checking if the second element is equal to 'stash', which is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking if the first element is equal to 'git' and the second element is equal to 'stash'. This is causing the function to incorrectly return `False` when it should be `True` in the provided failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to correctly check if the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash'. This will ensure that the function returns `True` when the command is 'git stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
