The bug in the `match` function is caused by the incorrect check in the return statement. The bug checks if the second element of the split command script is 'stash', but it should be checking the first element instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the return statement to check the first element of the split script.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
