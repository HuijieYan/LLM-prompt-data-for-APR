The buggy function is intended to check if a Git command is related to stashing based on the command script and the presence of a specific message in the stderr output. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the stderr, which is not a robust check.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately checking if the Git command is specifically related to stashing. It only checks for the word 'stash' in the command script without verifying the context.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to check if the command script starts with 'git stash', which would indicate a stashing operation. We should also verify the context of the message in the stderr to ensure it is indeed related to stashing.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git' and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly checks if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the specific message related to stashing is present in the stderr. This update should fix the bug and make the function more robust in identifying stashing-related Git commands.
