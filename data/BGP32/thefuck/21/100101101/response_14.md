### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the given command is related to a git stash by looking at the script and stderr of the command. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison of the script with 'stash'. Based on the provided runtime and expected values, we see that the input command is related to git stash, but the comparison in the buggy function is not working correctly.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function checks if the second element of the split script equals 'stash', but in reality, the 'stash' is not always the second element. This incorrect comparison causes the function to fail the test.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains 'stash' instead of comparing it with the second element of the split script. This correction should ensure that the function correctly identifies commands related to git stash.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
