## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test is providing a Command instance with an empty `script` and a multi-line `stderr` containing usage information for `git stash`.
3. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` because trying to access the second element in a split list, but the list is empty.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two words so that the second word can be checked. However, in this case, the `stderr` contains usage information for `git stash` and the `script` is empty, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` is not empty before trying to access its second word.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` into words first and then checking the length of the resulting list before accessing the second element, we ensure that we avoid the `IndexError`.
