## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr. The bug occurs when the command script does not contain a second word, resulting in `IndexError: list index out of range`.

## Bug Location:
The bug occurs when `command.script.split()` does not have enough elements to access the second index.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that there will be at least two elements when splitting the command script. If the command script is only a single word, the split list will have only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the IndexError. Additionally, we should validate the length of the split list to make sure it is safe to access the second index.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of `split_script` is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError.
