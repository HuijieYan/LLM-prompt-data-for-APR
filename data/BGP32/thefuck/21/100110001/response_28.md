The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `script` of the command provided and check if the second element is equal to 'stash', and also if 'usage:' is present in the `stderr` of the command. The bug causing the error is that the function assumes there will always be at least two elements in the splitted list `command.script.split()`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 if there is only one or zero elements.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the length of the splitted list from `command.script` is at least 2 before accessing index 1. Additionally, we should ensure that the 'usage:' string is correctly present in the `stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) >= 2 and script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version first checks if the length of `script_split` is at least 2 before trying to access index 1 (which represents the second element). This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy version.

After implementing this fix, the function should pass the failing test provided.
