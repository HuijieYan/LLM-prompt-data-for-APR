## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to match a command that involves `git stash` and when the output of the command contains the word 'usage:'. However, the error message indicates that the `IndexError` is raised when trying to access the second element after splitting the command script.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error could be in accessing the second element of the split command script without checking if it actually exists.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the split command script will always have elements to access. In this case, if the command script does not have multiple elements after splitting, an `IndexError` will be raised.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has enough elements before accessing the index 1.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_list = command.script.split()
    return len(command_list) > 1 and command_list[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of the split command script before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version will pass the failing test.
