### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the command script contains 'stash' as the second word and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. If both conditions are true, it returns True.
2. The failing test is expecting the `match` function to not match when the stderr contains the usage message for git stash.
3. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised, specifically `list index out of range`, when trying to access the second element in the split script.
4. The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always have more than one word after splitting, leading to an IndexError when accessing the second word.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check the length of the split script first before accessing the second element to prevent IndexError.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

After making this correction to the `match` function, it should now handle the case where the command script contains only one word, preventing the IndexError. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
