## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is a decorator `@git_support` that receives a `Command` object as input.
2. The bug occurs when the function tries to split the `script` attribute of the `Command` object without checking if there are enough elements to index.
3. The buggy function is failing with an `IndexError` because it assumes there will always be at least two elements after splitting the `script` attribute, resulting in a `list index out of range` error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if there are enough elements in the split `script` attribute before accessing the second element.
5. By updating the conditional statement within the `match` function, we can prevent the IndexError error and ensure the function works correctly.

## Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function checks if the split `script` attribute has at least two elements before verifying if the second element is `'stash'`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` from occurring and ensures the correct behavior of the function.
