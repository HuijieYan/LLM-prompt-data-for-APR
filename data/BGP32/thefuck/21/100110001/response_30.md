### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test is asserting that the `match` function should not return True for a specific `Command` object.
3. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is raised when trying to split the command script. This suggests that the command script does not have a second word, causing the list index to be out of range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script has more than one word before trying to access the second word.

### Fixes:
We can modify the `match` function to check if the script has at least two words before comparing the second word with 'stash'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

Now the corrected version checks whether there are at least two words in the command script before accessing the second word to compare with 'stash'. This should prevent the `IndexError` and fix the buggy behavior.
