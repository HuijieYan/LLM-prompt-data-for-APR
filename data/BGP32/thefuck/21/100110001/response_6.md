## Analysis:
1. The function `match` is used to determine if a command is related to Git stash based on the command's script and stderr.
2. The buggy function is checking for the second element in the split command script to be `'stash'`. If this condition is not met, it means the command is not related to Git stash.
3. The error occurs when the index `[1]` is accessed in `command.script.split()` without verifying if the split command contains at least two elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when the command script does not have a second element.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the index `[1]`.

## Solution:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the command script into parts and checking if it has at least two elements before accessing the index `[1]`, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
