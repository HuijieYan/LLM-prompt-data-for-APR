### Analysis:
1. The `match` function in `git_fix_stash.py` is checking if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the stderr. 
2. The failing test `test_not_match()` is trying to assert that the `match` function should not match a `Command` object with the stderr containing "usage: git stash list".
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically stating "list index out of range". This suggests that the `split()` method is being called on an empty list which doesn't have a second element.
4. The cause of the bug is that the script passed to the `Command` object in the failing test does not contain the word "stash".

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word in the script. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By first checking if the length of the `words` list is greater than or equal to 2, we ensure that we won't encounter an `IndexError` when trying to access `words[1]`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
