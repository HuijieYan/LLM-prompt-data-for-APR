## Analysis:
1. The `match` function is expected to check if a given command is related to Git stash by verifying if the first argument of the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The buggy function attempts to split the script of the command and access the second element which is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs when there are not enough elements in the split list.
3. The failing test is expecting the `match` function to return `False` when provided with a Git command that does not match the expected criteria. The error traceback clearly points to the `IndexError` being raised in the `match` function due to the attempt to split an empty script.
4. We need to update the logic of the `match` function to handle cases where the script is empty or does not contain the required number of elements to avoid the `IndexError`.
5. The correction involves checking the length of the split script list before accessing the required index.

## Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version first splits the script and then checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before accessing the index to avoid the `IndexError`.
