## Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command stderr.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the `split()` method used on the `script` attribute of the `Command` object might be causing the issue.

## Bug Explanation:
The issue occurs because the `split()` method is used on the `script` attribute of the `Command` object without checking if there are multiple words in the script. When there are no words in the script (e.g., just 'git'), an `IndexError` is raised when trying to access the second element in the split result.

## Bug Fix:
We need to first ensure that the command script actually has more than one word before accessing the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before trying to access an index.

## Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.rules import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second index, we avoid the `IndexError` issue in the corrected version of the function.
