### Analysis:
1. The `match` function takes a `command` object as an argument.
2. The function checks if the second word in the `command.script` attribute is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr` attribute.
3. The error is caused by an `IndexError` on the line that tries to access the second word in `command.script` using `split()[1]`, which indicates that there might be cases where the `command.script` does not contain enough words.
4. The failing test expects the `match` function to return `False` when the conditions for matching are not met.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that there are enough words in `command.script` before trying to access the second word. We can do this by checking the length of the split command and then comparing it to the second word.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second word, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy function.
