### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is not handling cases where the `command.script` does not have the expected structure, leading to an IndexError when attempting to split the script.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is testing the scenario where the match function should not match the command, but it is failing due to the IndexError in the buggy function.
- The error message indicates that an IndexError occurs in the buggy function at line 8 when trying to split the command script.
  
### Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script will always have a valid structure where the second element can be accessed directly using `split()[1]`. This assumption leads to an IndexError when the script of the command does not contain multiple elements.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the command script has the expected structure before accessing its elements to avoid IndexError.
- Modify the condition in the `match` function to properly handle cases where the script may not have the expected structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `command_parts` before attempting to access the second element, we ensure that the function does not raise an IndexError. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
