### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match()` is expected to return `True` if the input command is related to `git stash` and the stderr of the command contains the word 'usage:'. Otherwise, it should return `False`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects the `match()` function to return `False` when the input command is not related to `git stash`.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the line where the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is being made. This means that the `split()` operation does not have enough elements to access the index `1`, causing the error.
4. The bug is occurring because the `split()` operation may not always result in a list with enough elements to access index `1`. This is likely due to commands that do not have a second word after the initial command keyword.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command has more than one element before accessing index `1`. If there is more than one element, then we can proceed with the comparison. Otherwise, we can return `False` as the command is not related to `git stash`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command and ensuring it has more than one element before accessing index `1`, we can prevent the `IndexError` and fix the bug in the `match()` function.
