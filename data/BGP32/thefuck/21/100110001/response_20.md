The buggy function `match` is failing due to an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist in the split list of the command script. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is split into a list before trying to access specific indices. We should also check that the length of the split list is enough to prevent IndexError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function `match` will split the command script into parts and then check if there are at least two parts before trying to access the second part. This will prevent the IndexError observed in the failing test.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test.
