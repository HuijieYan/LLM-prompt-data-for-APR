The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash', then it verifies if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. The error message indicates an 'IndexError: list index out of range' which means there is an issue with accessing an index that doesn't exist in the split command script.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to first check if the split script has at least two elements before accessing the second index 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before accessing the index 1. This will prevent the 'IndexError' from happening and ensure that the function works correctly.
