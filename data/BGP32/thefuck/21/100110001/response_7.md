The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the second element in the list obtained by splitting `command.script`, assuming that it exists. However, if the input script is not in the expected format, this will lead to the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that we handle cases where the split list may not contain the expected number of elements. One way to do this is by checking the length of the split list before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This version first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before examining the second element. This avoids the `IndexError` when the split list does not contain enough elements.
