Based on the error message and the failing test, the issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it is trying to split the `command.script` string and directly access the second element without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when `command.script` doesn't contain enough elements to split.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` string contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. We can also simplify the condition to check if the command contains the word 'stash' in it.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and 'stash' in split_script[1] and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the split command before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function will not encounter an `IndexError`. Additionally, the modified condition still checks if the command contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr, retaining the original logic.
