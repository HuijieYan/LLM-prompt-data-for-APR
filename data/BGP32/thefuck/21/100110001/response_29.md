### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `match`, is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the script and stderr of the command.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that the `split()` method is trying to access an index that does not exist in the split list.
3. The cause of the bug is related to the `split()` method being called on an empty string. This results in an empty list, causing an index out of range error when trying to access an index that doesn't exist.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` method is only called on non-empty strings to avoid the index out of range error.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Explanation of Fix:
- The updated version first splits the `script` attribute of the command into a list named `split_script`.
- It then checks if the length of the `split_script` list is greater than 1 to ensure that the list contains elements to prevent the IndexError.
- Finally, it verifies if the second element of the `split_script` list is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
- This ensures that the `split()` method is only called on non-empty strings, fixing the index out of range error.
