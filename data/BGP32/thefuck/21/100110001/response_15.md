The buggy function `match` is causing an IndexError because it is trying to access an index which might not exist when splitting the command script. 

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element using index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` first before accessing the second element, we ensure that the index exists and prevent the IndexError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
