## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is causing an `IndexError` due to an attempt to access an index that does not exist. The function is splitting the `command.script` by spaces and trying to access the second element (index 1) to check if it is 'stash'. However, there are cases where the split result may not have a second element, causing the `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by spaces, which is not always true. In this case, when the `command.script` doesn't contain the word 'stash', the split result could have less than two elements, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the split result is less than two elements.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    sp = command.script.split()
    return (len(sp) > 1  # Check if split result has at least 2 elements
            and sp[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `match` function includes a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` and make the function more robust.
