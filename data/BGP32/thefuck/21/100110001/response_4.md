The buggy function `match` is throwing an `IndexError` because it is splitting the `command.script` by whitespaces and assuming there will always be a second element to check if it is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `stderr` contains the usage message for `git stash`, and there is no `'stash'` keyword in the `command.script`, resulting in an empty list after splitting by whitespaces.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Here's the corrected version:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into words and then checks if the list `words` has at least two elements before checking if the second element is `'stash'`. This change prevents the `IndexError` when there are not enough elements in the split result.
