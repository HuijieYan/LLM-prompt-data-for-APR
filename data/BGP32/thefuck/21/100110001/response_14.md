## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash', as well as if the string 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. The error message indicates that there is an 'IndexError: list index out of range' on line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is at `command.script.split()[1]`, where it is assumed that a second element exists after splitting the script. If the script doesn't have sufficient elements, an `IndexError` is raised.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is not guaranteed to have at least two elements after splitting. When the script doesn't have enough elements, trying to access the second element directly causes an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two elements after splitting before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) >= 2 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of `script_elements` is at least 2 before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function will not encounter an `IndexError`.
