The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access an index that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two elements before accessing the index. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1
            and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `command_parts` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the function does not throw an `IndexError`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
