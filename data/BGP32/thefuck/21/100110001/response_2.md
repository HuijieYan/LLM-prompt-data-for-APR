The buggy function `match` is experiencing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. This happens because the script may not contain the necessary number of elements to access `[1]`, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the split command script may not have enough elements to access `[1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first storing the split script in a variable and then checking if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing index `[1]`, we can avoid the `IndexError`. This revised version ensures that the function only proceeds to check for 'stash' in the command script if there are enough split elements in the first place, preventing the error.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test without any errors.
