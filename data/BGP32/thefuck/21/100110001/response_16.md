## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command matches the pattern where the second word is 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the buggy function.
3. The failing test is trying to match a command that is missing the 'git' keyword in the script.
4. The bug is caused by assuming the command will always have multiple words separated by spaces, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second word in an empty list.
   
## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word.
   
## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `match` function will handle empty command scripts gracefully and should pass the failing test successfully.
