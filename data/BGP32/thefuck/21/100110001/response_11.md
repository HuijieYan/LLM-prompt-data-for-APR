## Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will have at least 2 words after splitting. If the script does not have two words, an `IndexError` occurs.
3. The failing test indicates that the `IndexError` happened while executing the buggy function.
4. The bug can be fixed by first checking if the script has at least 2 words before trying to access the second word.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, we first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second word. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.
