### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains `"stash"` as the second word and if the stderr contains the word `"usage:"`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the buggy `match` function should return `False` in this particular case.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the list index being out of range in the buggy function due to `command.script.split()[1]`.
4. The bug is caused because the `command.script.split()` might not have enough elements to access index 1, leading to the IndexError.
5. We need to modify the logic of the `match` function to handle cases where the split command script does not have enough elements.

### Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This fix first checks if the split command script has more than 1 element before accessing index 1 to prevent the IndexError. If the condition is satisfied, it then proceeds to check for the presence of `"stash"` as the second word and `"usage:"` in the stderr.
