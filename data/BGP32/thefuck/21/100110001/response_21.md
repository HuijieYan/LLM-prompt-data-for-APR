### Analysis:
- The `match` function is supposed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, an IndexError is raised because the code tries to access an index in the list that doesn't exist.
- The failing test is trying to assert that the function does not match, but due to the IndexError, it fails.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always have a second word after splitting by spaces. If the command script is empty or does not have a sufficient number of words, an IndexError will occur.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the split command has enough elements before accessing index 1.
- Handle empty or insufficiently long command scripts gracefully to avoid IndexError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

### Updated Function with Explanation:
- Convert the `command.script.split()` call into a variable to avoid calling `split()` multiple times.
- Check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1.
- The conditional statement now checks if both conditions (`split_script[1] == 'stash'` and `'usage:' in command.stderr`) are met to return `True`.

### Updated Test to Pass:
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
