## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is structured to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test is asserting that the `match` function should return False when given a command with stderr containing the git stash error message.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the command script. This suggests that there might be cases where the command script does not contain multiple words, leading to the list index being out of range.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

## Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `script_words` before accessing the second word, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix ensures that the script contains multiple words before attempting to check if the second word is 'stash'.
