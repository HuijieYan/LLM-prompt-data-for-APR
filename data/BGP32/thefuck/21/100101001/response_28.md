### Fixing the bug

The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of the word 'usage:' in the entire `command.stderr` string, which causes the function to return `True` even if 'usage:' is preceded by other characters. To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check if 'usage:' is at the beginning of the `command.stderr` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr.startswith('usage:'))
```

This fix ensures that the function only returns `True` if 'usage:' appears at the beginning of the `command.stderr` string, as required by the test case.
