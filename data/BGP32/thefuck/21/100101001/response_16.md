### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the condition may not be correct because the `command.script` might not always start with `'git stash'` and the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` might not be a definitive indicator of the command being related to stash.

### Bug
The bug in the `match` function is that it assumes the second word in the `command.script` is always `'stash'`, which may not be true for all cases.

### Fix
We should focus on checking if the command primarily deals with stashing changes rather than just looking at specific words in the script. We can check if the command contains the word `'stash'` and has a general association with stashing changes.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and any(word in command.stderr for word in ['usage:', 'list', 'show', 'drop']))
```
