### Analysis
1. The function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The expected behavior is that when the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`, the function should return `True`.
3. However, the test is failing for the case where `command.script` is `'git'` and `command.stderr` contains the usage information for `git stash`.
4. The cause of the failure is that the function is checking for 'stash' as the second word without considering the other parts of the command.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle different parts of the command and check for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:' separately.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in parts and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting the `command.script` and checking if 'stash' is in the parts, we ensure that the function is more robust in identifying the 'stash' command correctly.
