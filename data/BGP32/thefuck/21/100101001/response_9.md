### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the input git command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. However, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the command as a match based on the provided test that expects a non-match.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it's checking for 'usage:' in the stderr of the command, but the test case is passing the entire error message which contains newline characters (`\n`). Therefore, the comparison fails.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to include newline characters so that it matches the full stderr message.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify a match when the command is 'git stash' and the stderr contains the 'usage:' message.
