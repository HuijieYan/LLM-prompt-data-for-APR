### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The failing test is expecting the function not to match when the `command.script` is 'git' and 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr'.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it directly checks if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' without handling cases where `command.script` may not have a second word, causing the function to throw an index out of range error.

### Fix
We need to first check if `command.script` has more than one word before checking if the second word is 'stash'.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

With this correction, the function will first ensure that `command.script` has more than one word before attempting to check if the second word is 'stash'. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
