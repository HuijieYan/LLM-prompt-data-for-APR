### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the function is not handling any possible whitespace or formatting issues that might exist in the `command.script` or `command.stderr`. This can cause the comparison to fail.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it directly compares the second word in `command.script` with 'stash' without considering any possible whitespace or formatting. This can lead to a mismatch and the function returning False when it should return True.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we can improve the matching condition to properly handle whitespace and formatting in the input `command.script`. We can also check if 'stash' is present as a separate word in the `command.script` to avoid any partial matching issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By splitting the `command.script` into parts and checking the length before accessing the second element, we ensure that the comparison with 'stash' is done correctly. This updated version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
