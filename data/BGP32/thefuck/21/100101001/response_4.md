The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of the substring `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr`. However, the provided failing test does not match the condition of the function, so it fails.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition in the `match` function so that it correctly checks if the script contains `'stash'` and if the stderr contains the usage information for `git stash`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (
        'stash' in command.script.split() 
        and 'usage: git stash ' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify the usage information for `git stash` in the stderr and pass the failing test.
