### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains a specific string ('usage:'). However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is not sufficient to determine if the command is indeed related to `git stash`.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it only considers the second word in the command script without proper context or validation, leading to incorrect matching criteria.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the matching criteria by checking if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. This way, we ensure that the command is a `git stash` related command and the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After making this correction, the `match` function should now correctly identify commands related to `git stash` and with 'usage:' message in the stderr. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
