### Analysis
The `match` function is supposed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if 'stash' is present in the script, leading to a false positive when the script does not actually involve stash-related commands.

### Bug
The bug lies in the conditional statement inside the `match` function, which only checks for 'stash' in the script without confirming if it is indeed a git stash command.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to validate that the command script starts with 'git' and contains 'stash'. Additionally, we should check if the stderr contains the specific usage message related to the stash command.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git') 
            and 'stash' in command.script
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```
