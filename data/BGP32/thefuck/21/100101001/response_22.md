### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the error output. However, the current implementation is checking for 'usage:' in the entire error output string, which is causing it to falsely identify certain commands as matches.

### Bug
The buggy function is incorrectly checking for 'usage:' in the entire error output message, leading to false positives.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should only check if the 'usage:' string is present at the beginning of the error output message. This will ensure that we are matching the expected usage information for the 'stash' command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr.strip().startswith('usage:'))
```
