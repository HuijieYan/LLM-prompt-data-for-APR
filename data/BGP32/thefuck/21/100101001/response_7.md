### Analysis
The `match` function is designed to check if the command issued is related to `git stash` and if the usage message is present in the stderr output. However, the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` checks if the second word in the script is 'stash', which may not always be the case.

### Bug
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is not a reliable way to check if the command is related to `git stash`.
2. The condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` is checking for the presence of a substring 'usage:', which is not precise enough.

### Fix
1. Modify the comparison to check if 'stash' is one of the words in the command script.
2. Use a more specific check to verify the presence of the usage message in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_words and 'stash' in script_words
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if both 'git' and 'stash' are present in the words of the command script and if the usage message for `git stash` is present in the stderr.
