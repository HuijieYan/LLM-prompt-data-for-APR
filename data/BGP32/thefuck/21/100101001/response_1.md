### Analysis
The buggy function is expected to match commands related to `git stash` when the usage message is present in the stderr output. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command script without considering the actual command being executed.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which only checks the second word in the command script to be 'stash'. This condition does not consider the full command and can result in false negatives when trying to match specific git stash commands.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script starts with 'git' and the second word is 'stash'. This will ensure that we are specifically targeting git stash commands. Furthermore, we need to check if the usage message is present in the stderr to determine a match.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the command script starts with 'git' and the second word is 'stash', along with checking the presence of the usage message in the stderr to make a match.
