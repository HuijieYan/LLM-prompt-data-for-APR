### Explanation:
- The function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- In the failing test case, the `Command` object is created with `script='git'` and `stderr` containing the usage information for `git stash`.
- The function is expected to return `False` because the `command.script` does not contain `'stash'`, but it is returning `True` because it only checks for the presence of `'stash'` as the second word.
- Therefore, the function does not correctly handle the case where the word `'stash'` does not immediately follow `'git'` in the `command.script`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the second word in `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if the command contains `'git'` followed by `'stash'`. This will ensure that the function only matches when the command is specifically `git stash`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and 
            words[0] == 'git' and 
            words[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
