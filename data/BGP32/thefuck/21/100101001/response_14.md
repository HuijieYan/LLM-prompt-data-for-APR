### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the `command.script` split by spaces is equal to 'stash', and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. This logic is flawed because it does not properly match the command and its output.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the comparison `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')`. This comparison is not checking for the correct command signature and does not capture the actual usage of the command.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to properly check if the command is 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. We can do this by first checking if the script starts with 'git stash' and then checking if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
