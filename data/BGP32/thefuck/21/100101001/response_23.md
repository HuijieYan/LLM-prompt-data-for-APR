### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command entered by the user is related to stashing in git. It does this by splitting the command script and checking if the second element is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, based on the failing test case provided, the function fails to match when the command script is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage details for git stash.

### Bug
The bug lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which is failing to properly match the command script when it is 'git'.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to properly handle the case when the command script is 'git'.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
