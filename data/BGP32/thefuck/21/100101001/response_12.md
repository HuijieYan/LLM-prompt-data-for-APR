### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the first word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case provided, the `command.script` is 'git' and `command.stderr` contains the usage information for the `git stash` command, not just 'stash'.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `match` function to correctly check if 'stash' is in the `command.script` and if 'git stash' is in `command.stderr`. We can achieve this by modifying the function as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```

This updated logic will correctly match the test case where `command.script` is 'git' and `command.stderr` contains the usage information for 'git stash'.
