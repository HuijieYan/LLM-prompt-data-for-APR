### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the condition is incorrectly checking for the exact match of the entire second word instead of just checking if it contains the word 'stash'. This is why the test is failing.

### Fix Strategy
Modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the second word in the `command.script` contains the word 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()[1]
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly identify the command as a git stash command even if there are additional characters in the script and will check for the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.
