### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains a specific message. However, the current implementation checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the entire stderr, which is incorrect.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it naively checks for 'usage:' in the entire stderr, rather than just the start of the line.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if 'usage:' is present at the start of a line in the stderr. This will ensure that we are correctly identifying if the command is a git stash command.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('usage:') and 'stash' in command.script:
            return True
    return False
```

By splitting the stderr into lines and then checking if any line starts with 'usage:' and if 'stash' is present in the command script, we can accurately determine if the command is a git stash command with correct usage.
