The buggy function is attempting to match commands related to the `git stash` operation based on the presence of the word 'usage:' in the stderr. However, the buggy function is incorrectly splitting the command.script and checking if the second part is 'stash', which will likely cause issues if the command has additional arguments or options.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to properly check if the command starts with 'git stash' rather than checking the second part of the split script. This will ensure that the function accurately matches commands related to `git stash`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By using `startswith('git stash')`, we are now checking if the command begins with 'git stash', which is a more robust approach to matching `git stash` commands. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
