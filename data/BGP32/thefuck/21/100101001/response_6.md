### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the test case `test_not_match` is expecting the function to return `False` when the command script is 'git' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that the function will always return `True` if the command script contains 'stash' regardless of the rest of the conditions.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script starts with 'git' and the second word is 'stash', and then check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (script_words[0] == 'git' and len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
