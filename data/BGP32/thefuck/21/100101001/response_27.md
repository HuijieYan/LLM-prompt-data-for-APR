### Analysis
The `match` function is supposed to check if the command is related to 'git stash' based on the input script and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This may lead to false positives if the command has 'stash' in the wrong position in the script.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it solely relies on the second word of the command script being 'stash' to determine if the command is related to 'git stash', which may not always be accurate.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' is a standalone word in the script and also confirm the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words and script_words[script_words.index('stash') - 1] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is a standalone word in the command script and if the word before it is 'git'.
