### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the provided test case is not passing because the command script is 'git' and not 'stash', which causes the function to return False. 

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the first word in the command script is 'git' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. This will correctly identify the command as a git command with an error containing 'usage:'.

#### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
