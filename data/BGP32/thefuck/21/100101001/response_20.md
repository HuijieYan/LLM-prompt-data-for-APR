### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return False when given a `Command` object with `script` as 'git' and `stderr` containing the 'git stash' usage instructions.
3. However, the current implementation of the `match` function is flawed because it directly splits the `command.script` without checking if it contains more than one word. This can lead to an `IndexError` if the `command.script` is shorter than expected.
4. To fix this, we need to check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before comparing the second word to 'stash'.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split `command.script` before comparing the second word, we can avoid the `IndexError` and correctly match the condition in the test case.
