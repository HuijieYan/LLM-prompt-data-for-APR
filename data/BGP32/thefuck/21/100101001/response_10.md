### Explanation:
The `match` function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the test case is passing a Command object with the script as 'git' and the stderr containing the usage information for the 'git stash' command, which does not match the condition in the `match` function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `match` function is that it is not correctly checking for the command 'git stash' in the script.

### Fix:
Update the `match` function to correctly check if the script contains 'git stash' instead of just 'stash'. Also, check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr to accurately determine if the command matches.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
