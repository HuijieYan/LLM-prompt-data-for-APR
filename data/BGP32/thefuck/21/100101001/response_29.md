### Analysis
The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' text is present in the `command.stderr`. The failing test is not matching because the `command.script` does not contain 'stash', leading to the condition failing.

### Bug
The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is causing the bug. The input command does not have 'stash' as the second word in the `command.script`, leading to the function not matching.

### Fix
We need to update the condition to check if 'stash' is present anywhere in the `command.script`, and keep the check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
