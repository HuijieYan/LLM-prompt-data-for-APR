### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the script and stderr of the command. However, the current implementation is checking for the presence of the word 'stash' directly in the script split, which is incorrect.

### Bug
The bug is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition is incorrect as it directly compares the second element of the split command script with 'stash', which may not be accurate for all cases.

### Fix
Instead of splitting the command script and comparing with 'stash', it would be more reliable to check if 'stash' is present anywhere in the script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will properly check if 'stash' appears in the script and if 'usage:' appears in the stderr, which would align with the intended behavior of matching commands related to `git stash`.
