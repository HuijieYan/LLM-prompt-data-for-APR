### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the `command.script` only contains 'git', which makes the check fail. This leads to the test `test_not_match` failing.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of 'git stash' in the `command.script` rather than just 'stash' and ensure that 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
