### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command matches with `git stash` and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, it solely relies on the command.script to check for the presence of 'stash', which can lead to incorrect matching.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it only checks the second word in the command.script to be 'stash', which is not reliable as 'stash' can appear in different positions in the script.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should parse the command.script correctly and check if 'stash' is one of the arguments passed to the git command.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script.split():
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

By splitting the command.script into individual words and checking if 'stash' is present in any of those words, we can ensure that the correct condition is met for detecting a git stash command.
