The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command passed as input is related to Git stash by looking for the word 'stash' in the script and checking if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. 

The issue with the current implementation is that it splits the command.script and directly compares the second element with 'stash', assuming it's always at index 1, which may not be the case.

To fix this bug, we should modify the match function to properly check if 'stash' is present in the script and 'usage:' is present in stderr without relying on a specific index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.lower()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By using the `in` operator to check if 'stash' is in the script and 'usage:' is in the stderr, we can ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the position of 'stash' in the command script.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_not_match` should now pass.
