### Explanation
The `match` function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is incorrect.

In the provided failing test, the command script is 'git', which does not match the condition set by the function leading to the test failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `match` function to check if the command contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
