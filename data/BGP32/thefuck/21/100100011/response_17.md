## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to identify if the given command involves a git stash operation based on certain conditions. It checks if the script contains 'stash' as the second word and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. The failing test is supposed to check if the `match` function correctly identifies when the command does not involve git stash.

## Error Location:
The error is in the `match` function, particularly in the line `command.script.split()[1]`, where it assumes there will always be at least 2 words in the command script which is not true in all cases.

## Cause of the Bug:
The error occurs when the script of the command does not have at least 2 words, causing the `IndexError` to be thrown. In the failing test, the command provided is just 'git', so when `command.script.split()` is called, it returns a list with only one element which does not have an index of 1. This causes the error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the command script does not have at least 2 words. We can check the length of the split script before accessing the index.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the index, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test provided.
