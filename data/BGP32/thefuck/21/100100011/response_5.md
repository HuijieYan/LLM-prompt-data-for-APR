### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is a decorator function that is used for matching git commands that contain 'stash' in the second argument position and have 'usage:' in stderr.
   
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the buggy function `match` does not match when given a Command object with script="git" and stderr=git_stash_err.
   
3. The GitHub issue indicates that when the script is just 'git', the buggy function is throwing an `IndexError: list index out of range` due to accessing the second element of the split command script without ensuring that the split result has at least two elements.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `match` assumes that the command script will always have at least two parts (command name and argument). However, in the case of 'git' being the script, there is only one part which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the split command script has at least two parts before trying to access the second part.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) >= 2
            and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the split command script has at least two parts before comparing the second part with 'stash'. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'.
