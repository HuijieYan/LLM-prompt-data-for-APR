### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue:
1. The buggy function is `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py`.
2. The function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
3. The GitHub issue reports that the function fails when the script is just 'git', resulting in a `IndexError: list index out of range`.
4. The error occurs because splitting an empty script results in an empty list, causing the index out of range error.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing the index.


### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and
            script_words[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Explanation:
- I modified the buggy function by first splitting the `command.script` and storing the result in `script_words`.
- Then, I checked if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 to ensure that an index can be accessed.
- Finally, I included the original conditions to check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

### Result:
The corrected version of the function should now handle the case where the script is just 'git' without causing an IndexError.
