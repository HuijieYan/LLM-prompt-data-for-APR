### Bug Analysis:
The `match` function is supposed to check if a Git command's script is to manage stash (`stash` in this case) and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the script has just the 'git' command and raises an `IndexError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is occurring in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
Specifically, when there are no other arguments after the 'git' command, the split() function returns only the 'git' command itself in the list, leading to the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be at least one argument after the 'git' command in the script. When the script consists only of 'git', the split() function only returns 'git' in the list, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should first check if the script has at least two parts after splitting, and then proceed to check if the second part is 'stash' and check if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
