### Analysis:
The buggy function `match()` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, there is a bug in the function related to indexing when splitting the script.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script.split()` will always have at least 2 elements, which is not true when the script is just 'git' as shown in the failing test. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the split script does not have enough elements to access the second word. We can first check if there are at least 2 elements in the split script before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function works as intended.
