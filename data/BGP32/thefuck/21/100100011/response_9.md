### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is supposed to check if the second word in the script of the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The bug occurs when the script of the command is just 'git' which leads to the list index being out of range when trying to access the second word in the script.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the error message that occurs when the bug is triggered, indicating that the list index is out of range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. Additionally, we need to add a condition to keep the function from matching when the script is just 'git'.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr
            and script_words[0] != 'git')
``` 

### Summary of Changes:
1. Check if the number of words in the script is greater than 1 to prevent the index out of range error.
2. Add a condition to check that the first word in the script is not 'git' to avoid the bug caused by 'git' script.
3. Update the return statement to include these conditions.

By making these changes, the corrected function will avoid the index out of range error and address the bug described in the GitHub issue.
