## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `match(command)` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file.
2. The function checks if the script contains the word 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the error output.
3. The failing test `test_not_match()` is expecting the match function to return False when the command is not 'git stash'.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem as the rule failing when 'script' is just 'git'. The error message in the issue states that there is a 'IndexError: list index out of range' in the `match` function.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that the `command.script.split()` will always have a second element (index 1) when splitting by space. This assumption fails when the script is just 'git', leading to an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy:
- We need to handle the case where `command.script.split()` does not have enough elements to access the index 1.
- To fix this, we can first check if the length of the splitted command is greater than 1 before accessing the index 1.
- If the length is less than 2, then we can simply return False because there won't be a 'stash' command in this case.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

After applying the fix above, the function will handle the case when the script is just 'git' and prevent the IndexError.
