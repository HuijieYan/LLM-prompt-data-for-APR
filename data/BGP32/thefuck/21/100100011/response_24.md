The buggy function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. The issue arises when the command script does not have enough elements to be split, causing an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `match` function to first check if the script has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This way, we ensure that the script has enough elements to prevent the IndexError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the script into parts and checks if it has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. If the condition is satisfied, it also checks if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

By making this modification, the function should now be able to handle cases where the command script does not have enough elements to be split into [1] index.
