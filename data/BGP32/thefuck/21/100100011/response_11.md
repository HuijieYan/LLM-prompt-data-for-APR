### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is using indexing without proper error handling, which leads to an `IndexError` if the `split` operation on `command.script` does not return a list with at least two elements.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking the negative case where the command is "git" and the stderr contains a certain string. This fails due to the buggy function returning an `IndexError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when the script is just "git", causing the list index out of range error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that `split()[1]` will always exist in the `command.script` when checking for a specific command `'stash'`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Add a check to ensure that `split` operation returns a list with at least two elements before accessing the index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
