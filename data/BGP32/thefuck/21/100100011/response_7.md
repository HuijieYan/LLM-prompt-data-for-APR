### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is used to check if the input command involves the `git stash` operation and if the command output contains the string "usage:". The current implementation checks if the second part of the input command (split by spaces) is equal to 'stash', which might lead to an "IndexError" if the input command is just 'git'.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to assert that the `match` function returns `False` when provided with a mocked Command object where the stderr contains the `git_stash_err` string.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and make the function more robust, we should add additional checks to ensure that the input command contains at least two parts before accessing the second part to avoid the "IndexError."

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the updated function, we first check if the split command has more than one part before accessing the second part and comparing it to 'stash'. This modification prevents the "IndexError" when the command script is just 'git'.
