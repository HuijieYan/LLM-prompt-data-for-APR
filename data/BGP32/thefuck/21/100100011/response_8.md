The bug in the `match` function is likely caused by assuming that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements when splitting by whitespace. The error occurs when the `command.script` is just "git" without any additional arguments, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) >= 2
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'  # Check if second element is 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command before trying to access the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` when the script is just "git" with no additional arguments. This corrects the bug and the function should now pass the failing test `test_not_match`.
