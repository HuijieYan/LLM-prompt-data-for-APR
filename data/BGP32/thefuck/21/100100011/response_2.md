### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the script of the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the failing test is providing a Command object with only 'git' as the script, which causes the `command.script.split()` to result in a list with only one element. Accessing `command.script.split()[1]` in this case results in an `IndexError` due to the list index being out of range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements, which is not true when the command script is just 'git'. This assumption leads to an IndexError in the buggy function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script.split()` has less than two elements. We can first check if the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Updated Test:
To test this corrected function, update the failing test to include the necessary imports and use the updated match function:
```python
from thefuck.rules.git_fix_stash import match

def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where the command script has only one element and should pass the failing test case.
