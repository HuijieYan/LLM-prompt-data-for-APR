## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis:
The `match` function is checking if the command is related to `git stash` by splitting the script and checking the second element. However, the bug occurs when the script is simply `git` without any additional arguments. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption in the `match` function that there will always be at least 2 elements in the script when splitting. When the script is only `git`, there is only 1 element after splitting and trying to access the second element leads to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements available after splitting the script before trying to access any specific index. We should also incorporate the check for the presence of `stash` in the script to ensure we are still targeting the correct command.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script into parts and then check if there are at least 2 parts available and if the second part is `'stash'`. If these conditions are met, we proceed with further checks.

By incorporating this check, we ensure that we only attempt to access the second element of the split script when it is guaranteed to exist, avoiding the `IndexError` seen in the buggy function.
