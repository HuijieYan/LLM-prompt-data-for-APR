## Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is a `git_support` decorated function that checks if the command script contains 'stash' as the second element and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
- The failing test `test_not_match` tries to assert that the buggy function does not match when the command is 'git' and the stderr contains the information about various git commands.
- The GitHub issue describes that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just 'git' due to an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the script will always have at least two elements after splitting, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element if it does not exist.

## Fix Strategy:
- We need to handle the case where the script might not contain the second element and avoid the `IndexError`. We can do this by checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` that was causing the issue. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
