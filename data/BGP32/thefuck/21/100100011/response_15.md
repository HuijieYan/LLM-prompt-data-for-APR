### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a `git` command is being run with the `stash` argument and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, it assumes that the command has at least two arguments (splitting by space and checking the second element), which is leading to an `IndexError` when the command is simply `git`.

### Error Cause:
The error is caused when the `split()` method is used on a single-word command, leading to a list with only one element. Trying to access the second element of this list (`split()[1]`) results in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `match` function to first check if the command contains the 'stash' argument and then check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` when dealing with single-word commands.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr

```

By updating the `match` function as shown above, we ensure that the `split()` operation does not cause an `IndexError` when the command has only one argument. This corrected version should pass the failing test and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
