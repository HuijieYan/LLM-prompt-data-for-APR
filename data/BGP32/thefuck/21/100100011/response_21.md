## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash` rule is trying to match a git command that includes the word "stash" and has the string "usage:" in its stderr. However, the bug occurs when the command script does not have any arguments after `git`. This leads to a `IndexError` because the function tries to access the second element of a split command script which doesn't exist.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be at least two elements in the split script, whereas some git commands may not have any arguments after `git`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check that the split script has enough elements before accessing any specific index. We can also validate that the first element of the split script is `'git'` before proceeding with the match condition.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if there are at least two elements in the split script, verifies that the first element is `'git'`, and then checks if the second element is `'stash'`. This should prevent the `IndexError` and correctly match the desired git command.
