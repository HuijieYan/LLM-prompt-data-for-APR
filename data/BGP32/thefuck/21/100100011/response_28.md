## Analysis:
1. The `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is intended to match a specific condition related to a git command, specifically when the second word in the command is `'stash'` and the string `'usage:'` is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking that the `match` function does not match a specific condition when the input command is `'git'`.
3. The GitHub issue details show that when the command is only `'git'`, the `match` function causes an `IndexError` because it tries to split the input command and access the second part which doesn't exist. This is in line with the failing test.
4. The bug occurs due to assuming that the input command will always have two parts after being split by spaces. When the input command is only `'git'`, there is no second part, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to handle cases where the input command does not have the expected second part. This can be done by first checking if the split command has more than one element before trying to access the second element.

## Corrected Version of the `match` Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1, we ensure that we only try to access the second element when it actually exists. This modification should prevent the `IndexError` and allow the function to work correctly in all cases.
