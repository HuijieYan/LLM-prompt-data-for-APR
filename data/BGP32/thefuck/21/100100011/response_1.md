## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with test code and GitHub issue
The buggy function `match` is defined in the file `git_fix_stash.py` and it is a part of the `git_support` decorator. The function checks if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the standard error contains 'usage:'. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the script is just `git`, the function fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the buggy function is related to the `command.script.split()[1]` expression. If the script does not contain a second element (as in the case of `git` command only), accessing the index `[1]` would result in an `IndexError`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `split()` method is splitting the script by spaces and trying to access the second element directly without checking the length of the split list. In the case of `git` command, where there is only one element ('git'), accessing index `[1]` results in an `IndexError`.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list contains enough elements before accessing the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split list before trying to access index `[1]`.

## Providing a corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_elements` before accessing index `[1] in the corrected version, we ensure that we avoid the IndexError when the script does not have enough elements. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
