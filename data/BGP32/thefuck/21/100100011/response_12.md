## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is using `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second element of the command is 'stash'. 
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking that the `match` function returns `False` when the `stderr` contains the output related to `git stash`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the error occurs because `command.script.split()[1]` is generating an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script is just 'git'. This indicates that the function is assuming the split will always have at least two elements, but that's not the case in this scenario.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the split command, but when the script is just 'git', there is only one element after splitting.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`.

## Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_command` before accessing `split_command[1]`, we ensure that the index is within bounds and prevent the `IndexError` in this case.
