The buggy function `match` is currently causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to split the command script and access the second element without checking if the list has at least two elements. This leads to an IndexError when the list is empty or has only one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split list is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version ensures that the list `script_parts` has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This modification should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
