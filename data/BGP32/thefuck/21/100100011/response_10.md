## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command that contains 'stash' as the second word and has 'usage:' in the stderr. However, the buggy function is failing because it is trying to access the second element of a list without checking if the list exists or not. This results in an `IndexError` when the split command does not produce two elements in the list.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function assumes that the split command will always produce a list with at least two elements, which is not always the case. In the failing test scenario, the command only has 'git' as the second word, so when trying to access the second element from the split list, it throws an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the list does not have enough elements, the function should return False.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function will check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` and correctly evaluates the conditions for matching the command.
