## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the usage error message is present in the output.
2. The test function `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should not return a match when provided with a command that does not contain the word 'stash' in it.
3. The GitHub issue reveals that the bug occurs when the command script is just 'git', resulting in an `IndexError` since it tries to access the second element of the split script, leading to 'list index out of range'.
4. To fix this bug, we need to validate the length of the split script before accessing the second element.

## Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should resolve the bug and allow the test to pass successfully.
