### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test is asserting that the `match` function should not match a command where the stderr contains `git_stash_err`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the error occurs due to a `list index out of range` error, specifically when accessing `command.script.split()[1]`, suggesting that the `command.script` might not have enough words to split.
4. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have more than 1 word.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script` has at least 2 words before trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and
            script_parts[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, we prevent the `list index out of range` error and ensure that the function works correctly.
