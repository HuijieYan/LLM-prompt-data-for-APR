## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr of the command contains the string 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the function tries to split the command script and access the second element (`command.script.split()[1]`), causing an `IndexError` when the list index is out of range.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that the script will always contain at least 2 elements after splitting. In the failing test case, the command script is just 'git', so when split, it results in a list with only one element causing the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second one. If not, the function should return False. Additionally, it would be beneficial to refactor the function to make the check for 'stash' and 'usage:' more robust.

## Revised Code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) >= 2 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second one. This prevents the `IndexError` and ensures that the correct conditions are met for the function to return `True`.
