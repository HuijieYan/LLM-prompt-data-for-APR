### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking whether the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` doesn't have a second word due to an 'IndexError', which makes the buggy function fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` has enough words before attempting to access the second word. We should also consider additional checks to prevent accessing invalid indexes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split() 
    return (len(command_split) > 1  # Check if there are at least 2 words in the command
            and command_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if the length of `command_split` is greater than 1 before accessing the second word, we can prevent the 'IndexError' that occurs when there are not enough words in the `command.script`.
