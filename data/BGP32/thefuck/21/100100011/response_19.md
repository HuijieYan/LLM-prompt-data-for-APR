## Analysis:
1. The `match` function is defined with a decorator `@git_support`, indicating it is a specific function for handling git commands.
2. The `match` function checks if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the error output of the command.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking for a condition where the command is `git` but with an error message related to `git stash`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the problem occurs when the script is just `git`, leading to an `IndexError: list index out of range` within the `match` function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that `command.script.split()` will have a minimum of two elements to access the second word directly. When the script is just `git`, the split operation returns a list with only one element, causing the IndexError.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second word. If the split returns less than two elements, the function should return False.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_words) >= 2 
            and command_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version of the `match` function checks if the split `command_words` list has at least two elements, then proceeds to check if the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the error message.
