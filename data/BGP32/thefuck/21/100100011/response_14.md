The bug is caused by the `match` function trying to access the second element of the split script when there might not be any elements in the script. This leads to the "list index out of range" error when the command script does not contain any extra arguments after 'git'.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split script before attempting to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, we should return False to indicate that the command does not match the criteria.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1, we ensure that we do not run into an "index out of range" error and only proceed to check the command script's contents if there are enough elements after splitting.
