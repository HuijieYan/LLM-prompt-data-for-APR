## Fixing the Bug

### Error Location:
The potential error in the `match` function is the assumption that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements after splitting it. If `command.script` is just "git" without any additional arguments, splitting it and attempting to access index 1 will result in a `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `match` function is assuming the script will contain at least two elements after splitting, but in cases where the script is just "git", it raises an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If it doesn't, the function should return `False` to indicate that the command does not match the conditions.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of `script_parts` and returning `False` if it is less than 2, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This updated version will ensure that the function behaves correctly even when the `command.script` does not contain additional arguments like in the case of just "git".
