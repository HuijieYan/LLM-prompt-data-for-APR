### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is using `command.script.split()[1]` to extract the second word from the command script and checking if it is equal to 'stash'. This logic is causing an `IndexError` when the command script does not have the required word.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to assert that the `match` function should return False for a specific command. However, the buggy implementation throws an `IndexError` instead of returning False.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script always has at least two words, which is not true in the case where the script is just 'git'.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We can modify the logic in the `match` function to first check if the split command script has more than one word before accessing the second word.
2. If there are more than one word in the script, then we check if the second word is 'stash'.
3. Otherwise, we return False.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

The corrected version first checks if the split command has more than one word, then proceeds to extract and check the second word. If the conditions are not met, it returns False.

By implementing this fix, the `match` function will no longer throw an `IndexError` and will correctly evaluate the conditions for the provided command script.
