### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is a decorator function with `@git_support`.
2. The function checks if the command script's second argument is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the `match` function does not match when the stderr contains the git_stash_err message.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when the script is just 'git', leading to a `IndexError` due to a split attempt on an empty list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `command.script.split()` is performed on the 'git' command, which results in an empty list since 'git' has no arguments passed. This causes the subsequent `[1]` access to throw an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has more than one part before accessing the second part. We should also ensure that 'stash' is in the script and 'usage:' is present in stderr to identify the 'git stash' error message correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) >= 2 
            and parts[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
