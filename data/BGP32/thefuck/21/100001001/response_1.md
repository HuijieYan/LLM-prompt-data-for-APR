### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. Based on the provided runtime values, the `command.script` is 'git' and the `command.stderr` contains the usage information for 'git stash'. 

### Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that it is only looking for the exact word 'stash' in the `command.script`, but it should be checking if 'stash' is a part of the `command.script`. Additionally, the condition to check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr` is not handling the difference in spaces before 'usage:'. 

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if 'stash' is in `command.script` using the `in` keyword, and adjust the check for 'usage:' to be more flexible by including spaces. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
