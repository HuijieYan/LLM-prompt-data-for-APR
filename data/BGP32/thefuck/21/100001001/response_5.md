### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, based on the provided runtime values, the command script is 'git' and not 'stash', which causes the function to fail.

### Bug
The bug in the function lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. It assumes that the second word in the command script will always be 'stash', which may not be the case.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the command involves the 'stash' operation regardless of its position in the script.

### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This updated condition will check if 'stash' is present anywhere in the command script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr to properly identify commands related to the 'stash' operation.
