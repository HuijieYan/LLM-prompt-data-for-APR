### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime values, it seems like the script is just 'git' and not 'git stash', therefore causing the condition to fail.

### Bug Fix
We need to modify the condition to check for 'git stash' instead of just 'stash' in the `command.script`. This will ensure that the function accurately identifies the command as related to stashing in the Git context.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
