### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the word "stash" is the second word in the `command.script` and if the string "usage:" is in the `command.stderr`. However, the provided test case shows that the `command.script` value is `'git'`, which means the condition `'stash' == 'stash'` will pass, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it incorrectly checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' without considering the complete command context.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks the complete `command.script` string for the presence of the 'stash' command and also correctly verifies the 'usage:' string in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
