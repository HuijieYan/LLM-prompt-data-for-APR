### Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, in the provided runtime values, the command script is 'git', not 'stash', which causes the function to incorrectly return False.

### Bug Fix:
We need to update the condition to correctly check if the script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
