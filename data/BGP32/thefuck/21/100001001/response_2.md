### Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to match a command that involves 'git stash' and has an error message containing 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the script is 'stash', which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is related to stashing.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition only checks if the second word in the script is 'stash', but it should verify the presence of 'stash' as a separate word in the command.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if 'stash' is a separate word in the command script.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version will now properly check if 'stash' exists as a separate word in the command script and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr, as intended.
