### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime values and types, the second word in the `command.script` is always 'git', not 'stash', causing the condition to fail even when 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` instead of comparing it directly. This will accurately identify commands involving 'stash'. Additionally, we should continue checking if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr` for a complete match.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
