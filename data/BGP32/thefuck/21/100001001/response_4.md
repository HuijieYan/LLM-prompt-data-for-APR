### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the term 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The issue lies in the comparison of the script split, as it assumes the second word will always be 'stash'. However, the script split includes other elements that may change the position of the word 'stash'.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if 'stash' is present in the script split instead of comparing the second element directly. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies if the command involves 'stash' regardless of its position in the script.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
