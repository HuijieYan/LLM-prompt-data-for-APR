### Analysis
From the provided buggy function, the function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. This condition might not be sufficient to accurately determine if the command is related to Git stash operations.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function is solely relying on the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr to determine if the command is related to Git stash. However, in the provided case, the command.script does not contain 'stash' as the second word, leading to a false negative result.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should improve the condition to correctly identify if the command is related to Git stash operations. One approach could be to check if the command starts with 'git stash'. This updated condition will help in accurately matching Git stash related commands.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
