### Explanation
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, based on the provided runtime values, the script is 'git', not 'stash', which causes the function to incorrectly return False.

### Bug Fix
We need to modify the function to check if 'stash' is one of the words in the command script, rather than just the second word. This will make the function more flexible in detecting the usage of the 'stash' command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if 'stash' is present in any part of the command script, we ensure that the function can correctly identify the usage of the 'stash' command even if it's not the second word.
