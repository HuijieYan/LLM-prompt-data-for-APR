### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. This approach is flawed because it assumes that 'stash' will always be at the second position in the script, which may not be the case. Additionally, the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr` does not guarantee that the command is related to 'stash' specifically.

### Bug
The bug lies in the assumption that 'stash' will always be the second word in the script.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should explicitly check if 'stash' is present in the script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr, regardless of the word's position in the script.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting the `command.script` into words and checking if 'stash' is present in any of them, we ensure that the function correctly identifies commands related to 'stash'.
