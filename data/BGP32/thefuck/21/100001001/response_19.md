### Explanation
The buggy function is designed to match a command that contains 'stash' as the second word and has 'usage:' in the stderr output. However, the current implementation is prone to error because it checks for an exact match of the second word without considering the rest of the command or potential variations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should check if 'stash' is present in the command and 'usage:' is present in the stderr output. This will make the function more robust and adaptable to different command variations.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By modifying the condition to check for the presence of 'stash' in the command script, the corrected function will be able to accurately identify the intended commands based on 'stash' and 'usage:' keywords in the respective locations.
