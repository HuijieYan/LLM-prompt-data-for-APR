### Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to match git commands that involve stashing changes based on the condition that the command script contains 'stash' and the stderr output contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second element in the command script split is 'stash' without considering the complete command script.

### Bug in the code:
The buggy function is checking only the second word of the command script instead of the entire script. This is causing the function to not properly match commands that contain 'stash' in the script but not as the second word.

### Fix:
We need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' is present anywhere in the command script and if the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
