### Explanation
The buggy function is designed to check if the command executed is related to 'git stash' and if the stderr of the command contains the string 'usage:'. However, the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is flawed as it assumes that the second word in the command script must be 'stash', which is not necessarily true.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we should check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and not rely on the position of the word 'stash' in the command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
