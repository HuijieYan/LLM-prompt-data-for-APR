### Explanation
The buggy function is designed to match commands related to the git stash operation based on the command script being 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. However, the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is problematic because if the script only contains 'git', trying to access index 1 after splitting causes an IndexError, leading to a failure in matching.

### Bug Fix
A more robust approach would be to check if 'stash' is present anywhere within the script instead of relying on its position in the split list. Additionally, the presence of 'usage:' in stderr can be used as a secondary check.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
