### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, in the provided code, both conditions are being checked separately and not in combination.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the return statement of the `match` function, where the conditions are not properly combined.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to combine the conditions properly using the logical operator `and`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
