### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match commands related to `git stash` where the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is incorrect.

### Bug
The bug is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition only checks if the second word in the script is 'stash' and does not consider the entire command or the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if 'stash' is present in the script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version will properly check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:', fixing the bug in the original implementation.
