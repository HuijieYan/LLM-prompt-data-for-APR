### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime values and types, the conditions in the return statement do not accurately match the inputs.

### Bug
The buggy function does not accurately match the conditions in the return statement with the provided runtime values. The `command.script` is `'git'`, and the second word is not `'stash'`, so the function should return False. Additionally, the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` should result in a match, but in this case, there is a discrepancy.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions in the return statement to accurately reflect the inputs. We should check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

This fix checks if the script has more than one word and if the second word is `'stash'`. It also verifies the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` to determine if there is a match.
