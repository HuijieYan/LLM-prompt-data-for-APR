### Explanation:
The buggy function `match(command)` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime values, the current implementation is failing to correctly identify the conditions for a match.

### Bug:
The function is not correctly identifying the word 'stash' in the command script and the presence of the 'usage:' string in the command's stderr.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the match condition to properly check for the required criteria in `command.script` and `command.stderr`. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we are checking if 'stash' is present in any part of the `command.script` and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr` for a proper match.
