### Error Identification
The current implementation of the function `match` is checking if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. However, the conditions are not sufficient to accurately determine if the command is related to stashing in Git.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function only checks for the word 'stash' in the second position of the command. In this case, the input command is `'git'`, which results in an error as it does not contain 'stash' in the second position.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if 'stash' is a keyword anywhere in the command and then verify the presence of the 'usage:' string in the stderr. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in command_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if 'stash' is present anywhere in the command_parts list, we can accurately detect commands related to stashing in Git.
