### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the input command is related to the `git stash` operation based on the script and stderr output. However, the current implementation is checking for the string `'stash'` in the second part of the split script, which may not always be accurate.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function only checks if the second part of the split script is `'stash'`, without considering other parts of the command.

### Fix
A better approach would be to split the script and then iterate over each part to check if it contains `'stash'`. If any part contains `'stash'` and the stderr contains `'usage:'`, then the function should return `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if any('stash' in part for part in parts) and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
