### Explanation
The buggy function is designed to check if a git command includes the word "stash" and if the stderr of the command contains the phrase 'usage:'. The bug arises because the condition in the return statement is checking for an exact match of the script split at index 1 with 'stash', which might not always be the case based on the provided input.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might not always be reliable if the git command is more complex or if other arguments are present.

### Fix
Instead of checking for an exact match at index 1, it would be more robust to check if 'stash' is included in the command script. Additionally, the condition should differentiate between actual usage instructions and other stderr messages.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will check if 'stash' is present in the command script and if the stderr contains 'usage:', providing a more accurate evaluation of whether the git command is related to stashing.
