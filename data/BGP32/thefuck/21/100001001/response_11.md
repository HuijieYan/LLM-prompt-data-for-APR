### Explanation of the bug
The function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. However, in the provided case, the script is 'git' and not 'stash', causing the function to return False incorrectly.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command stderr, while also ensuring that the script starts with 'git'. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the 'git stash' command.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git' and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
