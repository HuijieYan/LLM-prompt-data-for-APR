### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime values, the `command.script` is 'git' and not 'stash', causing the function to return False even when the desired conditions are met.

### Bug Description
The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the command script for 'stash' without accounting for the 'git' prefix. This leads to a false negative when it comes to identifying the correct command.

### Fix
Update the function to correctly check for the 'stash' command after the 'git' prefix in the `command.script` and keep the check for 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in parts and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
