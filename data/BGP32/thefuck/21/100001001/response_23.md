### Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` equals 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains 'usage:'. However, based on the provided runtime values, `command.script` is `'git'` and not `'stash'`, causing the function to incorrectly return `False`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function checks if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` instead of directly comparing it. Additionally, we should only check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr` if 'stash' is indeed present in `command.script`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
