### Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command is related to Git stash and if the usage message is present in the stderr of the command. However, the comparison in the return statement is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is incorrect.

### Bug:
The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is incorrect because it is checking the second word in the command script, which may not always be 'stash'.

### Fix:
We should check if 'stash' is present in the command script directly and also if the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if 'stash' is present in the command script, we ensure that the command is related to Git stash. Additionally, by checking for the 'usage:' message in the stderr, we confirm that the command usage prompt is present, indicating a potential error.
