### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, it seems to be checking for an exact match of 'stash' in `command.script` instead of checking if 'stash' is present in `command.script`. This may cause the function to fail because the script could have additional parameters before 'stash'.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` instead of performing an exact match. We can also modify the check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr` to improve the accuracy of the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this correction, the function will now correctly check if 'stash' is present in the script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr, addressing the issue in the original buggy function.
