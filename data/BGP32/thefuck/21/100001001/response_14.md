### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, the input `command.script` is `'git'` which does not contain the word `'stash'`, causing the function to return `False`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if the command contains the word `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the function checks for the word `'stash'` in the `command.script`.
