### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second part of the command script is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. The function is likely failing because it is not handling the case where there is extra whitespace or newlines in the command.stderr.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to ignore any extra whitespace in the command.stderr when checking for the presence of `'usage:'`. One way to do this is by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from the command.stderr before checking for the presence of `'usage:'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.strip())
``` 

This corrected version ensures that extra whitespace in the command.stderr is properly handled when checking for the presence of the `'usage:'` string.
