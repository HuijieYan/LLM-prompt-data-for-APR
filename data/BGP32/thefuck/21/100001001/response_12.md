### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is attempting to determine if the command is related to git stash based on the script and stderr of the command. It checks if the second word in the script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, it seems to be incorrectly splitting the script and not accounting for possible additional words or characters after 'stash'. 

### Bug
The bug lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. If the script contains additional parameters or characters after 'stash', this condition will fail even if the command is related to git stash.

### Fix
We need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' is present in the script rather than just comparing it with the second word. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly identify commands related to git stash based on the presence of 'stash' in the script.
