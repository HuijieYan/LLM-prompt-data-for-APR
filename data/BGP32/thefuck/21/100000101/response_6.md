### Problem Analysis
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, the expected input parameters show that `command.script` is 'git' and `command.stderr` contains the usage information related to git stash commands. This means the current implementation will not work as expected.

### Bug Explanation
The current implementation assumes that the second word in `command.script` will be 'stash', which is not the case based on the expected input. Additionally, the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr` is to be checked with respect to the git stash command usage information, not just the word 'stash'.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check for 'git stash' command in the `command.script` instead of just 'stash'.
2. Check for 'usage: git stash' in the `command.stderr` to ensure the correct command and usage info are being considered.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

The corrected version now properly checks if the command is 'git stash' and if the correct usage info is present in `command.stderr` before returning True.
