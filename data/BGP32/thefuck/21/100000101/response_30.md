## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, the condition for checking the second word in the `command.script` is incorrect, as it currently splits the command script based on spaces without considering the possibility of multiple words in the command.

## Bug Explanation
The current implementation is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash', which may not always be the case. This can lead to incorrect matching in cases where the script is more complex than just 'git stash'.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to check if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` instead of checking for the exact second word. This ensures that the condition is met as long as 'stash' is part of the script.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
