The bug in the provided function is that it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, this logic is incorrect as it should be checking if the first word in the command script is 'git' and not the second word.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version correctly checks if the first word in the command script is 'git', the second word is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.
