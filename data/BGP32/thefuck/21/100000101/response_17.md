The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the command's stderr. However, the condition in the return statement is checking for 'usage:' with a lowercase 'u', while the expected input has 'usage:' with an uppercase 'U'. This difference in case sensitivity is causing the function to return incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison for 'usage:' is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower())
``` 

This corrected version converts the command script and stderr to lowercase before checking for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:'. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and will correctly match the expected input for the test case.
