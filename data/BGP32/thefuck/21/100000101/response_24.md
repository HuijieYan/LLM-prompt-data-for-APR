The bug in the current function is that it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains 'usage:'. This check is not accurate because the 'stash' command can have other subcommands and options that might not contain 'usage:' in the stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the first word in the script is 'git' and if the second word is 'stash', then we can assume it is related to the stash command. We can ignore the check for 'usage:' in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash')
```

This corrected version correctly checks if the first and second words in the script are 'git' and 'stash', respectively, indicating that the command is related to the stash operation.
