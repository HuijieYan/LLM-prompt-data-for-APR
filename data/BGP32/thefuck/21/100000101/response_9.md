The bug in the current function is that it expects the second element in the split script to be 'stash' but checks for 'usage:' in the stderr, which is not logically related.

To fix this bug, we should check if the first element in the split script is 'git' and if the second element is 'stash'. Then we can simply return True if both conditions are met.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash':
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected version checks if the command script starts with 'git' followed by 'stash', matching the expected behavior.
