The buggy function is currently checking if the second element of the split command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. However, the expected behavior is to check if the first element of the split command is 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check the correct elements and strings. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will now correctly check if the first element of the split command is 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.
