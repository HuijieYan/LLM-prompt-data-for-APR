### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function only splits the `command.script` by whitespaces, which may not always guarantee that the second word is 'stash'.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes the second word in the `command.script` is always 'stash' without properly checking. This assumption may lead to incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should split the `command.script` and properly check if the second word is 'stash'. Additionally, we should check if the 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 to ensure there is a second word. Then it checks if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
