There is a bug in the current implementation of the `match` function. The function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. However, the `stderr` may contain the usage message with additional characters or words before or after `'usage:'`, leading to a failed match.

To fix this bug, we should check if the command starts with `'git stash'` instead of just `'stash'` and then verify if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will correctly compare if the command script starts with `'git stash'` and check for the presence of `'usage:'` in the error message.
