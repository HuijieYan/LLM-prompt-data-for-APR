The bug in the current function is that it is checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the expected stderr contains the full usage message and not just 'usage:', so the condition is not being met.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if 'stash' is in the command script and if the full 'usage:' message is in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```

This modification will correctly check if 'stash' is in the command script and if the full 'usage:' message is present in the stderr, satisfying the expected input/output values for the function.
