To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to update the condition checking within the `match` function. The current condition is checking if the second element in the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the expected condition is to check if the first element of the split command script is 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify commands where the first element is 'git' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
