The bug in the function is that it is checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash', but the expected value for command.script is 'git', so the condition will always be False. 

To fix this bug, we should check if 'stash' is present in the command.script instead of comparing it directly. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is present in the command.script and if 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr, which aligns with the expected input/output values specified.
