The bug in the current implementation is that it checks for 'usage:' in the command's stderr to determine if the command is related to 'git stash'. This is problematic because the 'usage:' message might also appear in regular git commands and not just specific to 'git stash'.

A better approach would be to directly check if the command is related to 'git stash' by analyzing the command's script instead of relying on the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```

This corrected version checks if the first word in the command script is 'git' and the second word is 'stash', which directly determines if the command is related to 'git stash' regardless of the error message in the stderr.

This should fix the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output values for the function.
