The bug in the current function appears to be related to how the script is split to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. The function should split the script by spaces to get individual elements and then check the conditions to return True or False.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the command script by spaces and then checks if there are more than 1 element in the splited_script. It then checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
