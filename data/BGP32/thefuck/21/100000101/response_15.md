The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, this approach is not sufficient for correctly identifying if the command is related to git stash.

To fix this bug, we should check if the first word in the command script is 'git' and if 'stash' is in the command script. We can also check if 'usage:' is in the stderr to verify if the command is related to git stash.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git' 
            and 'stash' in splited_script 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly identifies if the command is related to git stash based on the script, without solely relying on the position of 'stash' and 'usage:' in the command.
