The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command's script is 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains 'usage:'. However, in the provided case, the 'stash' word is not separated from other parts of the command, and the stderr contains the complete usage message.

To fix this bug, we need to split the command's script correctly and check if the first word is 'git' and the second word is 'stash', then check if the complete usage message is present in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 
            and splited_script[0] == 'git' 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version splits the script correctly and checks for 'git' command first, then 'stash' and finally the complete 'usage:' message in the stderr. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
