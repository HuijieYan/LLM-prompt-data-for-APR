To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to ensure that we are correctly checking if the command's script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. In the current implementation, we are only checking if the command's script's second element is 'stash', which might not be accurate.

We should split the command script by spaces and then check if 'stash' is present in the split script. Additionally, we should check if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is present in the split script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr, which aligns with the expected input/output values.
