The bug in the provided function is that it is checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This might not cover all cases where the command is related to 'stash' and has usage information in the stderr.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if 'stash' is in the split command script and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly identify if the command is related to 'stash' and has usage information in the stderr, which aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
