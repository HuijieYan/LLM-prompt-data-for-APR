The bug in the current function is that it checks for the presence of the string 'usage:' in the command's stderr, but it does not consider the case where the 'usage:' string might have additional characters or newlines before it. This can lead to the function not correctly identifying the command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the split command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modified version ensures that the script starts with 'git stash' and contains 'usage:' in the stderr for it to be considered a match. This should resolve the bug and correctly identify the command with the expected input and output values.
