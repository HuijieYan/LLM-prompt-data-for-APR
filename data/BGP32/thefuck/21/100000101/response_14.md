The bug in the provided function is that it checks if the second element in the split command script is 'stash', but it should actually be checking the first element. Additionally, the condition should be checking if 'usage:' is in the stdout, not the stderr.

To fix the bug:
1. Change `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` to `command.script.split()[0] == 'stash'`
2. Change `'usage:' in command.stderr` to `'usage:' in command.stdout`

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stdout)
``` 

This corrected version should now correctly match the expected input/output values for the test cases.
