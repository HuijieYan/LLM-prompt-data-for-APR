To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to ensure that the comparison checks the desired conditions accurately. Currently, the function checks if the second part of the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. 

However, the 'stash' command should be considered a separate command in Git, so we need to check if the first part of the command script is 'git' and the second part is 'stash' to accurately identify the 'git stash' command. Additionally, we need to check if the 'usage:' string is in the stderr for the 'git stash' command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the 'git stash' command before checking for the 'usage:' string in the stderr. This revised version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
