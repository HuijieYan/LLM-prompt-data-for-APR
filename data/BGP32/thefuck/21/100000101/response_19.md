The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect comparison of the script split. The function is checking if the second element of the split script is 'stash' instead of checking the first element. This causes the function to incorrectly return False in most cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison to check the first element of the split script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will correctly check if the first element of the script split is 'git' and the second element is 'stash' before checking the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected based on the input parameters and the expected output values.
