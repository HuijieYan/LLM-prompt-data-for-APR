The bug in the current function is that it checks for the presence of `'stash'` in the second split element of the command script, which will always be false since the script is split at index 0 by default. Instead, it should check for `'stash'` in the first split element of the script.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check for `'stash'` in the first split element of the command script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and 'stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the first split element of the `command.script` is `'git'`, if `'stash'` is present in the script, and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr.
