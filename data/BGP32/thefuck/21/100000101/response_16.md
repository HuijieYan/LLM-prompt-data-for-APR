The bug in the provided function is that it is checking if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the 'stash' keyword should be compared to the first element of the split command script, not the second.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the first element of the split command script with 'stash' and check if 'usage:' is in the stderr. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git'
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly match the expected input/output values provided in the test case.
