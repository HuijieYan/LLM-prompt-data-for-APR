The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the condition `command.script.split()[1]` is directly accessing the second element of the split script without checking if the split script has more than one element, which can lead to an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the split script has at least two elements before accessing the second element. We can also add a check to verify if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

This corrected version will first split the script and then check if there are at least two elements before accessing the second element. It will also verify if 'usage:' is present in the stderr for the command.
