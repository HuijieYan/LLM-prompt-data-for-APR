The buggy function `match` is currently causing an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the list returned by `split()` on `command.script` without checking if there are enough elements in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split of `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. Also, we should ensure that the error message in `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage:' as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version checks if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. If the condition is met, it also checks if 'usage:' is present in the error message. If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, otherwise `False`.
