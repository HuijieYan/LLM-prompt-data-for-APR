The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then checking if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, it does not handle the case where the script is just 'git' without any arguments, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of an empty list.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the function first checks if there are enough elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and handle the case when the script is just 'git'.
