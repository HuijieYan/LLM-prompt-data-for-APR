## Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the error occurs when `split()[1]` is accessed, and if there is no second word, it raises an `IndexError`. This bug is preventing the function from handling the case where the script is just 'git', causing the function to fail.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to assuming that there will always be at least two words in the command script, which is not true in cases like when the script is just 'git', leading to an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that there are enough words in the command script before accessing the second word. We can also check if the script is 'git' and return False in that case since the function is supposed to handle cases when the script is 'git stash'.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected function first splits the script, checks if it has at least two words, and then proceeds to verify if the second word is 'stash' and the 'usage:' is in the stderr. This correction should address the bug and handle cases when the script is just 'git'.
