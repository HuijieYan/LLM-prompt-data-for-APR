The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by space and then check if the second index is equal to `'stash'`. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that when the script is just `'git'`, the function fails with an `IndexError` because there is no second index in the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has enough elements to access the second index before comparing it with `'stash'`. Additionally, we need to compare the lowercase version of the script to avoid case sensitivity issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the split result has more than one element before trying to access the second index. It also compares the lowercase version of the script with `'stash'` to avoid case sensitivity issues.
