## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the script is just `'git'`, the function fails with a `IndexError: list index out of range` because `split()[1]` is being accessed without proper bounds checking.

## Bug Explanation
- When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting it by spaces results in a list with only one element since there are no spaces.
- Accessing the second element of this list (`split()[1]`) then raises an `IndexError` because there is only one element.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should first check if there are enough elements in the split list before trying to access the second element. We should also confirm that `'stash'` is the second element in the split list.

## The Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(splited_script) > 1
        and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

This corrected version checks if there are more than one element in `splited_script` before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. If both conditions are met, it also checks for `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`.
