The buggy function is failing because it assumes that the command.script has at least two elements after splitting with whitespace. However, in the failing test execution, the command.script is just 'git', which results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the element at index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the index 1. If not, return False.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the length of the split command is less than 2 before trying to access index 1. If it is less than 2, it returns False. This prevents the `IndexError` in cases where the command.script has insufficient elements.
