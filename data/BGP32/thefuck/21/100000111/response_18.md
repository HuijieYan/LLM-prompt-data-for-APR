## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is supposed to check if the git command issued is related to stashing based on the presence of the word 'stash' in the command and the appearance of 'usage:' in the command's stderr. However, the current implementation is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the command script only contains 'git'.

### Error
The error occurs in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. It attempts to access the second element of the list generated by splitting the command script, assuming it always exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()` does not guarantee the presence of at least two elements in the list. For example, when the command script is just `'git'`, splitting it will result in a list `['git']`, and trying to access the second element (`'[1]'`) results in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first ensure that the split script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the element at index 1. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split script list.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the element at index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix ensures that the function correctly identifies commands related to stashing in Git.
