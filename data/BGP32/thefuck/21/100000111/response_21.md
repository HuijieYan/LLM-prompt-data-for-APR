## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function checks if the second element of the split `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, when the command.script is just `'git'`, splitting it by spaces results in a list with only one element which leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element. This causes the buggy function to fail in the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the splitted `command.script` is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element. Additionally, we will need to update the condition to check for both `'stash'` as the second element of the split `command.script` and the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function will handle the case when the split `command.script` has only one element (i.e., when the script is just `'git'`) and prevent the IndexError from occurring. It will also maintain the behavior of checking for `'stash'` as the second element and the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr` as needed.
