## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when `command.script` contains only 'git' without any additional arguments. In this case, trying to split the script at index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least one additional argument after 'git'. When the script is just 'git', splitting it at index 1 will result in an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` has more than one word before attempting to access the second word. Additionally, we should check the presence of 'stash' in the correct index before comparing it.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` and checks if it has more than one word. Then it verifies if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. This will prevent the `IndexError` and correctly match the intended scenarios.
