## Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the command's script has `'stash'` as the second word and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the command's stderr. This function is meant to determine if the command is related to the `git stash` subcommand.

The bug occurs when the script contains only `'git'`, which leads to a `list index out of range` error when trying to access index 1 in the split script.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by accessing index 1 of the split script without proper validation that the script contains at least two elements. When the script is only `'git'`, there is only one element in the split script, causing the index out of range error.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. Additionally, we need to validate the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr of the command.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the split script has at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. It then validates both conditions required for a match.
