The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script.split()` list is equal to `'stash'`. This results in an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is only `'git'` because the split list will have only one element. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. It also includes the original condition for 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

This fix ensures that the function does not throw an `IndexError` when the `command.script` has only one element and satisfies all the expected cases provided.
