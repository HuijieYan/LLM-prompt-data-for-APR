The buggy function `match` is currently assuming that the second element (index 1) of the `command.script.split()` list is always 'stash'. This assumption is leading to an `IndexError` when the script consists of only 'git'.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the split list may not have a second element. We can also simplify the condition to check if the script starts with 'git stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the function does not raise an `IndexError` and accurately checks if the script starts with 'git stash' before proceeding.

By implementing this fix, the function will now correctly identify the case mentioned in the GitHub issue where the script is just 'git', and match the expected input/output values for the function.
