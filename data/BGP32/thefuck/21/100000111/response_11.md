## Analysis
The buggy function aims to check if the command script involves the keyword "stash" and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the function encounters an `IndexError` due to assuming that there will always be at least 2 elements after splitting the command script.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `split()[1]` operation is performed on the `command.script` without checking if there are enough elements in the resulting list. In the failing test case, the `command.script` is only 'git', causing the IndexError since there is no item at index 1.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should first verify that the `command.script` contains more than one element before attempting to access index 1. This can be achieved by comparing the length of the split list before accessing the index.

## Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated function avoids the `IndexError` by ensuring that there are at least two elements after splitting the command script. It should now correctly handle cases where the script involves 'git' without causing an error.
