## Analysis
The buggy function checks whether the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, in the provided case, the `command.script` is just 'git', which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word. If not, there should be a default return value to avoid the `IndexError`.

## Code Fix
```python
from thefuck.utils import get_all_matched_commands

@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word, preventing the `IndexError`. If the split result does not have at least two words, it returns `False`.
