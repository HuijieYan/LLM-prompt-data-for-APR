## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy implementation assumes that the script will always contain at least two elements after splitting. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the script contains only one element like in the case described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy code attempts to access the second element of the split script directly without checking if the split operation results in at least two elements. This leads to an IndexError when the condition is evaluated with a script containing only one element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the split script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split script before accessing any specific index.

## Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected implementation first splits the script and then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to prevent the IndexError.
