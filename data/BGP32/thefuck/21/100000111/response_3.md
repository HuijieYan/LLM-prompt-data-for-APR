The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the command's stderr contains the usage information. However, the current implementation directly accesses the second element of the split command script. This leads to an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'` as there is no second element in the list after splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should check for the presence of 'stash' in the split script rather than directly comparing it to 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        splited_script = command.script.split()
        return ('stash' in splited_script
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of the split script is at least 2 to avoid the `IndexError`. Then, it checks if 'stash' is present in the split script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

This correction should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function behave as expected for the provided test case.
