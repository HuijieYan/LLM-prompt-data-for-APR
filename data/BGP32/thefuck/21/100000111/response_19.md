The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`, and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, the issue description on GitHub indicates that the problem occurs when `command.script` is just `'git'`, which leads to an `IndexError` because trying to access the second element of a list with only one element results in an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version should address the issue described on GitHub and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.
