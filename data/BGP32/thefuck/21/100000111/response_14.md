The buggy function is trying to split the command script by spaces and then checking if the second element is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the buggy function does not handle the case where the command script does not contain any other argument besides 'git'.

The cause of the bug is that when the command script contains only 'git' and no other arguments, splitting the script by spaces will result in a list with only one element ('git'), causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also simplify the check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the split command script has at least two elements and if the second element is 'stash'
    if len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr

    return False
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by checking if the split command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the command script contains only 'git'.
