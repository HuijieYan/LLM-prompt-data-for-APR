The buggy function is designed to match a specific condition where the command script contains 'stash', and the command's stderr includes 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the command script does not contain multiple elements to index as indicated by `command.script.split()[1]`, resulting in a 'list index out of range' error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split command script has at least one element before attempting to access the second index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `splited_script` list before accessing the second index, we prevent the 'list index out of range' error. This correction ensures that the function behaves as intended and does not crash when provided with a command script that does not contain multiple elements for splitting.
