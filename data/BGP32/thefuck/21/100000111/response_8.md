The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is only `'git'`. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` expression in the `match` function.

The problem arises because the function assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting, which is not the case when the script is just `'git'`. To resolve this bug, we need to handle this edge case by adjusting the split operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) >= 2 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

In this corrected version:
- We first split the `command.script` and store it in the `script` variable.
- We then check if `script` has at least two elements and if the second element is `'stash'`, along with checking the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`.
- If all conditions are met, we return `True` indicating a match, otherwise, we return `False`.

This fix ensures that the function handles the case where the script is only `'git'` correctly, preventing the `IndexError` by checking the length of the split script before accessing specific elements.
