## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in `command.stderr`. However, the buggy function fails when the `command.script` is only 'git', leading to an `IndexError` as it tries to split a list of length 1 at index 1.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case, the input `command.script` is `'git'`, which is split into a list `['git']`.
2. The buggy function tries to access the second element of this list using `command.script.split()[1]`, which results in an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1 in `['git']`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to include a check to ensure that the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the `command.script` contains fewer words than expected.

## The Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script into words
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the script includes 'stash' and the 'usage:' keyword is present in stderr
    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
