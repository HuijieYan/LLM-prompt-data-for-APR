## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a Git command involves stashing changes based on the provided `command` object. It splits the command script and checks if the second part is equal to 'stash' while also looking for 'usage:' in the stderr of the command.

## Identifying the potential error

The potential error in this function lies in assuming that the command script will always contain at least two parts after splitting. The bug arises from trying to access index 1 after splitting the `command.script` list.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have enough parts to split into, resulting in `IndexError: list index out of range`. In the provided example from the GitHub issue, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which has only one part when split. Therefore, trying to access index 1 directly causes the error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if there are at least two parts after splitting the `command.script` before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script has fewer parts than expected.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, I first split the `command.script` into parts and store it in a variable `splited_script`. Then, I check if the length of `splited_script` is greater than 1 before proceeding to check if the second part is 'stash'. This modification ensures that the index out of range bug is resolved.
