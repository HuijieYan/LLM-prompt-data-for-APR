The issue is caused by the buggy function trying to access the second element of the split command script even though there might not be any second element in certain cases. This causes an IndexError when the script is just 'git' which does not have a second element for splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split command script before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if there are more than one element in the split command script before trying to access the second one. If there is not, it will avoid the IndexError and correctly handle the case when the script is just 'git'.
