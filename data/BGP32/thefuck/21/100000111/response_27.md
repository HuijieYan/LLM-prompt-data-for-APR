## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function is designed to match if a git command is related to stashing based on the command input script and stderr content. The function splits the input script and checks if the second element is 'stash'. However, the function does not account for scenarios where the script has only one element, leading to an 'IndexError'. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the script input to the function has only one element (like in the GitHub issue). In such cases, splitting the script based on whitespace results in a list with only one element, causing an 'IndexError' when trying to access the second element.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, an additional check is needed to ensure that the script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element when splitting the script. This will prevent the 'IndexError' and make the function more robust.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function first checks if the script has more than one element, and then proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash'. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an 'IndexError' when processing scripts with only one element.
