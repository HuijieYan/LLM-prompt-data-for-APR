## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `match` is designed to match a command where the script's first argument is 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs because the function directly attempts to access the second element of the split `command.script`, assuming it exists. In the failing case, when the script is just 'git', and the stderr contains usage instructions, an `IndexError` is raised.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not account for scenarios where the script might contain fewer elements than expected, leading to an out-of-range access error.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains enough elements after splitting before trying to access specific indices. We should also check if 'stash' is the first element in the split script.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the elements, we ensure that the indices are valid, preventing the IndexError. This corrected version conforms to the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
