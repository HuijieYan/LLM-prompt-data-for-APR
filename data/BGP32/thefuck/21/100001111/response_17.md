## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just 'git' and the function tries to split it to access the second word, leading to a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has enough words to split and access the second word. We should also ensure that 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. If either of these conditions is not met, the function should return False.

## Bug Fix
The corrected version of the function is:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first splitting the `command.script` and checking if it has more than one word, we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue reported.
