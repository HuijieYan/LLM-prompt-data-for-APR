The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `split()[1]` operation will always have at least two elements in the resulting list. When the `command.script` is `'git'`, the split result will only have one element causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element. We can also check if the command contains 'stash' as the first word to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split result before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly for the provided input and resolves the GitHub issue related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `'git'`.
