The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` string and check if the second element is equal to 'stash', which is causing the `IndexError: list index out of range` when the `command.script` is just 'git'. This error occurs because splitting 'git' with the split method results in a list with only one element, and accessing index 1 throws an error since it doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the function checks the length of the split result before accessing the second element, preventing the IndexError when the input string is just 'git'.
