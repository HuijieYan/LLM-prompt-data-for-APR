## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to extract the second element from the split command script and compare it with 'stash'. However, in the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue, the command script is just 'git', leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element in the split list.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the split command script will always have more than one element, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split script before performing the comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the splitted script before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. This corrected version should now handle cases where the script is just 'git'.
