The buggy function is trying to match a specific condition in the `command.script` by splitting it and checking if the second element is equal to 'stash', and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, in the provided failing test case, the `command.script` only contains 'git', so when the split operation is performed, there is only one element in the resulting list. Therefore, accessing the second element results in an 'IndexError'.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the split operation produces at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there is only one element after splitting, we should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix should prevent the 'IndexError' that was occurring in cases where the `command.script` had fewer elements after splitting.
