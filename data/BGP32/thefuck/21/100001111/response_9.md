## Bug Fix Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second element in the script (after splitting by whitespace) is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The bug occurs when the script does not have a second element after splitting. This causes an `IndexError` because trying to access `split()[1]` when there is no second element in the list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are at least two elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function should return False.

## Bug Fix

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After implementing this fix, the function will first check if there are at least two elements in the split script, and if not, it will return False without trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the bug.
