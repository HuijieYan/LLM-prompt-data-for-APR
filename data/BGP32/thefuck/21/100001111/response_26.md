The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it directly tries to access the second element of the split script without checking if the split script actually contains multiple elements or not. This leads to an `IndexError` when the script consists of only one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `split` operation results in multiple elements before trying to access the second element. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script and then check if there are more than one element in the split result before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` by verifying the length of the split result before accessing specific elements.
