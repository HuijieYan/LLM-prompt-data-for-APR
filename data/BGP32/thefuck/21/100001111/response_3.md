The bug in the function `match` is causing an `IndexError` due to trying to access the second element of a list when the list only contains one element. This is happening because the `split()` function is not checking if there are enough elements to access before doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split()` function returns at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the `match` function checks if the split script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring. The function now satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
