## Analysis
The function `match` is intended to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the `command.stderr`. However, there is a bug in the function that causes an `IndexError` when `command.script` does not contain any whitespace-separated words. This bug leads to the function trying to access an index that does not exist, resulting in a runtime error.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
The issue arises from directly accessing index `1` without checking if the split list has at least two elements.

## Cause of the Bug
In the failing test case, the `command.script` is `'git'`, which does not have any whitespace-separated words when split. As a result, accessing index `1` of the split list causes an `IndexError`.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` actually contains multiple words before attempting to access index `1` after splitting it. We can achieve this by adding a check to ensure the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second word with 'stash'.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the check `len(split_script) > 1`, we make sure that the split list has at least two elements before proceeding to compare the second word. This correction should prevent the `IndexError` and ensure the function works as intended for the provided test cases.
