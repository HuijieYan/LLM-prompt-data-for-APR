The bug in the function `match` is caused by trying to access the index `1` after splitting the `command.script`, which results in an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`. To fix this bug, we can check if the length of the `splited_script` list is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing index `1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `splited_script` list first, we ensure that the index `1` is accessible before accessing it. This fix should resolve the `IndexError` issue identified in the GitHub problem description.
