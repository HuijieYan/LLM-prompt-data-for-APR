The buggy function is checking if the second element in the `command.script` list is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the provided failing test case, the `command.script` value is `'git'`, which results in an IndexError when trying to access `split()[1]` since there is only one element in the list after splitting.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check whether the script contains `'stash'` instead of directly comparing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script
```

This modification will correctly identify commands that contain `'stash'` in their script, resolving the IndexError and aligning with the expected behavior and GitHub issue.
