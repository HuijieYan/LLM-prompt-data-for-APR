The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that the `split()` method on `command.script` will always result in a list with at least two elements, which is not the case when the script is just `'git'`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script.split()` returns a list with at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and handle cases where the script is just `'git'`.
