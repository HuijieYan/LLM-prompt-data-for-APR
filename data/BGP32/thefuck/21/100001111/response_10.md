## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function in the `git_fix_stash.py` rule is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` only contains a single word like `'git'`, causing the `command.script.split()` to result in a list with only one element. As a result, trying to access the non-existent second element (`command.script.split()[1]`) leads to a `list index out of range` error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we need to ensure that the string `'stash'` is present in the `command.script` before checking if it equals the second element.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By applying this fix, the function should now handle cases where the `command.script` contains only a single word like `'git'` without throwing an `IndexError`.
