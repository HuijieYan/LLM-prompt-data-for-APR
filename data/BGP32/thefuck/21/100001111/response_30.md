## Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, in the case provided, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, so splitting it and trying to access the second element of the resulting list will result in an IndexError. This explains the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` starts with `'git stash'`, and also check for the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`. This will prevent the IndexError and ensure that the match function behaves as expected.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By modifying the condition to check if the `command.script` starts with `'git stash'` instead of splitting it, we can avoid the IndexError and ensure that the function works correctly for the provided test case and matches the expected behavior.
