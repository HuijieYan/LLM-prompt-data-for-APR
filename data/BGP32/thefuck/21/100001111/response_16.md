## Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the standard error output. The issue arises when the command script only consists of 'git', causing the split operation to result in a list with only one element, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git."

## Bug Identification
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second element in the split command script list without checking its length beforehand.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to verify that the split command script list has enough elements before trying to access the second element. If the list has at least two elements, then we can proceed with checking if the second element is 'stash.'

## Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    
    return False
```

By incorporating the length check for the split script list before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly for cases where the command script does not have enough words to split into.
