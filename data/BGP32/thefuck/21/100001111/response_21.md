### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, the buggy function is assuming that there will always be a second word in `command.script`, which leads to the `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script is just 'git'.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will have at least one word after splitting by spaces. When the script is just 'git', the split list will have only one element ('git'), and accessing the second element leads to the `IndexError`.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits `command.script` and then checks if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This approach prevents the `IndexError` when the script is just 'git' and satisfies the expected input/output values.
