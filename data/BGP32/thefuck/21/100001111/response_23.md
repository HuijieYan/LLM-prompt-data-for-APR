## Bug Fix

### Issue:
The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the `split()` function result but doesn't consider cases where the script might not contain any spaces, leading to the `IndexError` when attempting to access index 1 of the split result.

### Fix:
We need to handle the case where the script doesn't contain any spaces. We can check the length of the split result before accessing index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split result and ensuring it's greater than 1 before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and address the bug. This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
