The buggy function has an issue with the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The problem arises when `command.script` does not contain any whitespace-separated words or does not have an index 1 element when split. This results in the `IndexError: list index out of range` as seen in the GitHub issue.


To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` is split into multiple words and that there is at least a second element before trying to access index 1 to compare it with `'stash'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script into words
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Ensure that the script contains more than one word and the second word is 'stash'
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into words and then checks if there are at least two elements in the `splited_script` list before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` by ensuring that index 1 is accessed only if it exists in the list.
