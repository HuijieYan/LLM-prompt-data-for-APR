The buggy function is checking if the second element in the split command script is 'stash' and if the usage message is present in the command's stderr. The issue arises when the script is just 'git', which results in an IndexError due to trying to access the second element of a single-element list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split command script has at least two elements before checking for 'stash'. We can also improve the logic to check if the script starts with 'git', which would cover cases where the script is only 'git' or 'git stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (split_script[0] == 'git' 
            and ('stash' in split_script or 'usage:' in command.stderr))
```

By first checking if the script starts with 'git', we avoid the IndexError when the script is just 'git'. Additionally, we check if either 'stash' is present in the split script or the usage message is in the command's stderr, as the presence of 'stash' is not always guaranteed in the script.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub related to the git_fix_stash rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
