The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element in the `command.script.split()` list is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` is just 'git', as in this case, the split list only contains one element and trying to access the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we need to check that the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version will ensure that the function only accesses the second element of the split list if it contains at least two elements, preventing the `IndexError` when `command.script` is just 'git'.
