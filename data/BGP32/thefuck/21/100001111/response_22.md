The issue is due to the command.script being split and checking the second element without verifying if it exists. To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the script is at least of length 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the script and checks if it has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This change ensures that we avoid the "list index out of range" error and properly handle the cases where the script might not contain enough elements for comparison.
