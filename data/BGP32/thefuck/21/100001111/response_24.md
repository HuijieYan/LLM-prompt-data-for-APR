### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the usage message is present in the stderr. However, the issue described in GitHub indicates that when the script is just 'git', the `split()[1]` operation is causing an IndexError because there is no second word to check. This is why the tests are failing.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be a second word in the command script. When the script is just 'git', there is only one word, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting the script.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the splitted script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This way, we can avoid the IndexError and handle the case where there is only one word in the script.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the splitted script before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError and ensure that the function works correctly even when the script is just 'git'.
