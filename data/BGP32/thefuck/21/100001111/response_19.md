## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second element in the split `command.script` equals 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. This function is causing an `IndexError` when `command.script` has only one element, as seen in the GitHub issue description.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` will always have more than one element after splitting. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when `command.script` has only one element.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the split `command.script` contains 'stash' at any index and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if 'stash' is in `script_parts`, we ensure that an `IndexError` won't occur due to indexing an empty list. This updated function should fix the bug and handle the case when `command.script` has only one element.

Now, the function will return `True` if 'stash' is present anywhere in `command.script` and 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`, which aligns with the expected behavior of the function.
