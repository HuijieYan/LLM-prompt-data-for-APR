The bug in the provided function is that it is assuming the existence of the second element in the split script, causing an "IndexError" when it doesn't find it. To fix this issue, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing its elements.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing its elements, we ensure that there are enough elements in the split script to avoid the "IndexError". This correction will address the bug and make the function work as expected, satisfying the provided test cases and resolving the GitHub issue related to the bug.
