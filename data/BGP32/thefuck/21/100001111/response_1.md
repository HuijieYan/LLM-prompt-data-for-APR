The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when `command.script` has only one word, leading to an "IndexError" due to accessing an index that doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `command.script` has at least two words before accessing the second word. Additionally, we should also check if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version ensures that we check if there are at least two words in the `command.script` before accessing the second word. This modification prevents the "IndexError" from occurring and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
