### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `match` checks if the second element in the `command.script` split by whitespace is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` only consists of `'git'` without any additional elements, which leads to a `IndexError` due to trying to access index 1 of the split list.

### Error locations
- The buggy function accesses index 1 of the split `command.script` without validating if it exists.
- The condition checks if the split script contains 'stash' without considering the possibility of an IndexError.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when the `command.script` is only 'git' without any additional element, causing the split result to have only one element. Accessing index 1 of the split list in such a scenario raises an IndexError since it doesn't exist. This results in the failure of the rule.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the split `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1. Additionally, we can include a check to see if the script starts with 'git stash' to handle this case more effectively.

### The corrected function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected version checks if the split `command.script` has at least two elements, verifies if the second element is 'stash', and confirms the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`. If all conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This modification addresses the IndexError and ensures the proper functioning of the rule.
