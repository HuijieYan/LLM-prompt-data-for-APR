## Bug Analysis:

The buggy function tries to check if the second element in the `split()` result of `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the case where `command.script` is `'git'`, the `split()` call will return a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix:

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split result list.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if the length of `split_script` is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError`. This corrected version should now work as expected for the provided test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
