The bug in the provided function is caused by directly accessing the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists, leading to a potential IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the script has at least two elements before checking if the second element is 'stash'. We can do this by modifying the return statement in the match function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By first checking the length of the splited script and then accessing the second element only if it exists, we prevent the IndexError that was occurring when the script was just 'git'.

This correction ensures that the function behaves correctly even when the script is 'git', satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.

This fix addresses the root cause of the bug and provides a more robust implementation for the match function.
