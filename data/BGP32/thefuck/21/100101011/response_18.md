### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The test function `test_not_match` is failing because the `command` object is missing the necessary arguments to fulfill the conditions inside the `match` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not contain at least two words. This leads to an `IndexError` because the split operation does not return a second element for comparison. In the failing test, the `command.script` only contains one word ('git'), causing the split operation to result in a list with only one element.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split result before performing the comparison. Additionally, we should also verify if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By incorporating the length check for `script_words` before accessing the second element and retaining the other conditions, we have addressed the bug in the `match` function.
