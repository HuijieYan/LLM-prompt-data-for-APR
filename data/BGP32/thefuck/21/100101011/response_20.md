### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. The failing test provides a `Command` object with `script='git'` and `stderr=git_stash_err`, where `git_stash_err` contains a message containing 'usage: git'.

### Issue
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is split by spaces, and since the `script` value is just `'git'`, indexing with `[1]` will raise an `IndexError`. This can be observed from the provided GitHub issue where the traceback shows the error happening at `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains the word `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. We should also handle cases where there may not be a second word in `command.script` to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' 
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

By modifying the function to first split the `command.script` and then check if a second word exists before comparing it with `'stash'`, we can avoid the `IndexError` and address the bug.
