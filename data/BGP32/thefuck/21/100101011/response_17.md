### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' exists in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the buggy function `match` should return False when the `command.script` is just `'git'` and the `command.stderr` contains the usage information for `git stash`.
3. The bug is occurring due to the assumption that there will be at least two words in the `command.script`. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting it by whitespace results in a list of one element. Accessing the second element in that list causes an `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the split `script_words` list has at least two elements before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` and correctly identifies the command as not matching when the script is just `'git'`.
