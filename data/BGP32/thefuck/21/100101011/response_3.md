### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will have at least two words (split by whitespace) and the second word will be `'stash'`. In the failing test case, the `Command` object is initialized with a script of `'git'`, which does not split into multiple words. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the split result.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain multiple words. We should add a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before trying to access index 1.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the `len(split_script) > 1` condition before checking `split_script[1] == 'stash'`, we ensure that we only attempt to access index 1 of the split result when it contains multiple elements. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the `command.script` has a single word.
