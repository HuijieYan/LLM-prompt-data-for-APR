### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, the buggy function fails when the `command.script` contains only `'git'`, as it results in an `IndexError` due to trying to split an empty string.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which cannot be split into multiple words. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word, as the list is empty.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. This can be done by splitting the `command.script` and checking if the resulting list has a length greater than or equal to 2.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` and fix the bug.
