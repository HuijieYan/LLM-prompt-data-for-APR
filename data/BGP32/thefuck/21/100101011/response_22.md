### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
- The failing test is checking if the match function returns false when the command is 'git' and the stderr includes the usage info for git.
- The error occurs when `command.script.split()[1]` is accessed, leading to an `IndexError` when the split function doesn't create a list of sufficient length.

### Bug:
- The buggy function assumes that the input command script will always have at least two elements after splitting by spaces. If the command script is just 'git', with no additional arguments, the IndexError occurs when trying to access index 1 of the resulting list.

### Fix:
- We need to add a check to ensure that the split operation creates a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
