### Potential error locations:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
Specifically, the error occurs when accessing the second element `[1]` of the split result of `command.script`. This access could lead to an `IndexError` if the split result does not have a second element.

### Cause of the bug:
Based on the provided information, in the failing test function, the `Command` object is created with `script='git'` and `stderr=git_stash_err`, which simulates the scenario when the `git` command is executed. In this case, the `git` command does not contain the word `'stash'`, and hence the split result of `command.script` with `split()` does not have a second element. Therefore, accessing `[1]` leads to an `IndexError`. This explains why the test is failing.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This way, we can avoid the `IndexError` and ensure that the function does not crash when the split result is insufficient.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This modification ensures that we prevent the `IndexError` by verifying the split result's length before accessing its elements.
