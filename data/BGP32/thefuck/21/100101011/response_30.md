The buggy function `match` is failing to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain at least two words. This is leading to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element from the split list.

### Bug Explanation:
- The test case provides a `command` with `script='git'` and `stderr` containing stash-related usage information. 
- The `match` function checks if the second word of the `command.script` is 'stash', which is causing the `IndexError` due to the insufficient number of words in `command.script`.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word.
- We can add a check to verify the length of the split command script before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check to verify the length of `script_words` before accessing the second element, the corrected version of the `match` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
