### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the input command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a Command object with script value as 'git' and stderr value containing the usage instructions for `git stash`, which causes the buggy function to fail with an IndexError due to splitting an empty script.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the rule fails when the script is just 'git', which aligns with the failing test scenario.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming the presence of a second word in the command script without properly checking for it. When the script is 'git', splitting it by whitespace results in a list with only one element, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough words in the command script before accessing the second word. We should also ensure that the specific check for 'git stash' is correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected `match` function checks if there are more than one word in the command script before trying to access the second word. This change will prevent the IndexError when the script is just 'git'. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
