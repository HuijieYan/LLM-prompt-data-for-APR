### Error location:
The error is occurring at `command.script.split()[1]`, which tries to access the second element of the split command script. The issue arises when the script only contains 'git', resulting in the split list having only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the git command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. However, when the script is just 'git', the split command returns a list with only one element, causing the IndexError.

### Suggested fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also further verify if the first element is 'git' to improve the condition.

### Corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[0] == 'git':
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    
    return False
``` 

By checking the length of the split script parts and validating that the first part is 'git', we prevent the IndexError and correctly validate the condition for the git command script containing 'stash' and the presence of the 'usage:' string in stderr.
