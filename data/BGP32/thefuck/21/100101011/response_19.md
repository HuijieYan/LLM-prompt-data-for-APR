### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is using `command.script.split()[1]` to retrieve the second element of the split command script. This code is assuming that `command.script` will always have more than one element after splitting, leading to the `IndexError` when the condition fails.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the buggy function does not match for a specific `Command` object with `stderr` containing the git stash error message.
3. The runtime input values indicate that `command.script` is `'git'`, which does not contain `'stash'`, so the condition should fail.
4. The GitHub issue highlights this bug, mentioning that when the script is just `git`, the buggy function encounters an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` might not have elements after splitting. We should first check the length of the split result to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function does not encounter an `IndexError`. This correction should make the function more robust and pass the failing test.
