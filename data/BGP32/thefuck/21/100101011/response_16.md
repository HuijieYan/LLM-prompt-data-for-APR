### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The buggy function splits the `command.script` parameter by whitespaces and accesses the second element directly without checking if it exists or not.
2. The comparison of the second element with `'stash'` might cause an error if the `command.script` does not contain a second element.

### Cause of the bug
The failing test is not passing because the buggy function is assuming that the `command.script` parameter will always have at least two words (elements) after splitting by whitespaces. In the provided scenario, where `command.script` is just `'git'` and the `stderr` contains the expected string, the buggy function still tries to access the second element after splitting, causing an `IndexError`.

### Strategy to fix the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second one. Also, we need to ensure that the first element is `'git'` and that the `stderr` contains the expected message. 

### Correction of the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2
            and splitted_script[0] == 'git'
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By modifying the function as shown above, we first ensure that `command.script` has at least two elements after splitting. Then we check if the first element is `'git'`, the second element is `'stash'`, and finally, we verify that the expected string is present in the `stderr`.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the `IndexError` and make the failing test pass when implemented.
