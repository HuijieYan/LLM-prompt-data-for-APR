### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is assumed to match a command where the script's second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the buggy function is failing for a command where script is just 'git' and the stderr contains 'usage:' information.

### Potential error locations:
1. The buggy function does not handle commands where the script has only one word, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is assuming that the script will always have multiple words and trying to access the second word directly. When the script contains only 'git' without 'stash', directly accessing index 1 throws an `IndexError`.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If not, then the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before trying to access the second word, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly for commands with multiple words or single word like 'git'.
