### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test is expecting the function to return `False`.
3. The failing test provides a `command` with `script` as `'git'` and `stderr` containing information about git commands, not related to git stash.
4. The bug is caused because `command.script.split()` on a single word like 'git' would result in a list with only one element, hence accessing the second element would result in an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
1. Add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains more than one word before splitting it.
2. Make sure to check if 'stash' is present in the split words to match the correct scenario.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this corrected version, the `match` function would first check if there are more than one word in `command.script` before trying to access the second word and then proceed with validating the conditions for matching.
