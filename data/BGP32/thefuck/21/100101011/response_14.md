### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the error output.
2. The failing test is checking if the `match` function does not return True for a command where the script is only 'git'.
3. The KeyError is due to trying to access the second element (index 1) of the `command.script.split()` list when the list might not have that many elements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that there will always be at least two elements in `command.script.split()`, but in the failing test case, there is only one element ('git'), leading to the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the function to check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before trying to access index 1 to prevent the IndexError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) >= 2
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function will first check that there are at least two elements in the split command before comparing the second element to 'stash', avoiding the IndexError when the split command has fewer elements.
