### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when the `command.script` is just 'git' and 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
3. The bug is caused by the assumption in the buggy function that there will always be a second word in the `command.script`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_words) > 1 and command_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `command_words` before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just 'git'. This fix should address the issue and make the test pass successfully.
