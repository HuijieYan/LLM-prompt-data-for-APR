### Analyzing the bug

- The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the `git stash` command was run and if the output contains `'usage:'`.
- The failing test `test_not_match` checks if the `match` function returns False when a `Command` object is passed with `stderr` containing 'usage:' for the `git stash` command.
- The runtime values and types provided show that the `command.script` is `'git'` and the actual `command.stderr` contains the usage information for `git stash`.
- The provided GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, resulting in an `IndexError` due to trying to split an empty list.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs because the `match` function is splitting `command.script`, expecting at least two elements (index `[1]`) in the split list, which causes an `IndexError` when the split list is empty.
- The bug is not handling the case where `command.script` is just `'git'`, resulting in an empty split list and leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to handle the case where `command.script` may not contain the necessary content for splitting.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (
        len(command.script.split()) > 1
        and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

By checking if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing index `[1]`, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the `command.script` does not contain sufficient content for splitting.
