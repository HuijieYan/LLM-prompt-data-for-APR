### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in the git_fix_stash rule is failing because it assumes that the command script will always have at least two elements when splitting by whitespace. However, in the failing test case provided, the command script is just `'git'`, which results in the `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access index 1 after splitting.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `match` expects the second element of the split command script to be `'stash'`, and it checks for the presence of `'usage:'` in the command's stderr. Since the failing test passes a command with only one element in the script (`'git'`), the buggy function encounters an IndexError when trying to access index 1 after splitting it. This leads to the function failing and not matching the command correctly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. Additionally, we should ensure that the second element is `'stash'` and that `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version checks if the split script has at least two elements before accessing index 1, ensuring that the function does not encounter an IndexError. This modification should address the bug and make the function match correctly for the given test case.
