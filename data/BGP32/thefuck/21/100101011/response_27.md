### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the input `command` relates to a git stash operation based on whether the script starts with `git` and the stderr message contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the `command` script does not have additional arguments beyond 'git', causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the split script.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly tries to access index 1 of the split script without checking if the split script has enough elements. In this case, when the script is just 'git', there are no other elements after splitting, resulting in the IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that there are enough split elements before trying to access index 1. We can also improve the condition to check if the second element of the split script is 'stash'. Additionally, we should validate if the stderr message contains 'usage:'. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the script first and then check for the conditions based on the split elements, ensuring that we avoid any IndexError. This correction addresses the bug and should pass the failing test.
