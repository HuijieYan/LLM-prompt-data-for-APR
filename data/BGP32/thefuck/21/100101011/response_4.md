### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains `'git stash'` and if the stderr output contains `'usage:'`. The provided test is expecting the function not to match when the command script is just `'git'`, which should be correct since `'stash'` is not present in the script.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`, which results in an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`. The function is incorrectly assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting by space.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the split command script does not have the required number of elements. We can add a check to ensure that the list resulting from the split has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the split script has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This modification should fix the `IndexError` and make the function work as expected when the command script is just `'git'`.
