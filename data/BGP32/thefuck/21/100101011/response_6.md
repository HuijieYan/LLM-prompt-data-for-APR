### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- The failing test is expecting the `match` function to return `False` when `command.script` is just `'git'`.
- The runtime values show that `command.script` is `'git'` and therefore the `split()` method will result in an empty list, causing an `IndexError`.
- The GitHub issue also confirms that the bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `split()[1]` operation is being performed without checking if the list resulting from `split()` has at least 2 elements.

### Fix:
1. Add a check to ensure that the list resulting from `split()` has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.
2. Update the `match` function to return `False` if the list from `split()` is empty or does not have the word `'stash'` as the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

The corrected version includes a check for the length of `script_words` to avoid the `IndexError` when accessing the second element. This fix should address the bug and make the `match` function work correctly with the failing test case.
