### Analysis
The buggy function `match()` is failing to handle cases where the command script does not contain the expected index 1 element ('stash'). This is leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that does not exist in the split list of `command.script`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Accessing index 1 of the split command script without checking the length of the split list.
2. Comparing the index 1 element directly with 'stash' without ensuring the split list has enough elements.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the script will always have at least two elements after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when this assumption is not met. The failing test confirms this bug in scenarios where the script contains only one element ('git').

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to first check the length of the split list before accessing index 1 to prevent `IndexError`. Additionally, we should verify that the split list has enough elements to compare with 'stash' to ensure the correct behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
```

By checking the length of the split list before accessing index 1, the corrected function prevents the `IndexError` and ensures that the comparison with 'stash' is only performed when there are enough elements in the split script. This fix should address the reported issue and allow the function to handle cases where the script is 'git' without errors.
