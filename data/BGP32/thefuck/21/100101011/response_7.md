### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` by verifying if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. The failing test `test_not_match` passes a `Command` object with stderr containing the usage message for git stash, but the script only contains 'git', leading to an index out of range error when trying to split the script.

### Identified error location
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
The issue arises because the script only contains 'git', leading to an index out of range error when trying to access the second element of the split array.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the script parameter will always contain 'git stash', causing an index out of range error when this assumption is not met.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This can be achieved by splitting the script and checking if the split array contains at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

### The corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This version first checks if the split script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element to prevent the index out of range error. If there are not enough words in the script, it returns False immediately.
