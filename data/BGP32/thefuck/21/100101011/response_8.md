### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command passed in matches the pattern 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, in the provided test case, the Command object is instantiated with the script value `'git'`, which leads to a IndexError due to an attempt to access the index 1 of the split result (causing the list index out of range error).

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the command script will always contain at least two elements after splitting. So when the script is just `'git'`, accessing index 1 after splitting results in the IndexError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle cases where the command script may not contain the expected number of elements after splitting. This can be addressed by checking the length of the split result before accessing the index.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access index 1, we prevent the IndexError. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle the case where the script is just `'git'`.
