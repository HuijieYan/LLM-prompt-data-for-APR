### Identified Bug:
The current implementation of the `match` function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have a second word after splitting by whitespace. However, when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, the split operation leads to an empty list resulting in the `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the `match` function to first check if there are enough elements after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, we are ensuring that there are at least two words in `script_words` before accessing the second element to fix the `IndexError` issue.
