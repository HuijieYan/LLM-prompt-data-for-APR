### Step 1: Analysis
The buggy function `match` takes a `Command` object as input and checks if the second word in the `command.script` attribute is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The failing test `test_not_match` passes a `Command` object with `script='git'` and `stderr` containing the usage information for the `git stash` command. The bug is causing an `IndexError` due to trying to access the second word in the split `command.script` when there is only one word ('git'). 

### Step 2: Identified Bug Location
The bug is located in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it tries to access the second element of the split result without checking if there are enough elements present.

### Step 3: Bug Explanation
The buggy function is trying to access the second word from the `command.script` attribute, which is causing an `IndexError` since there is only one word ('git'). This leads to a failure in the test because the condition for matching is never met due to the IndexError.

### Step 4: Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if there are enough elements after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second word. If there is only one word, the function should return False to indicate that it does not match the rule.

### Step 5: Fix the Bug
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking if the number of words in `command.script` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second word, we avoid the `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
