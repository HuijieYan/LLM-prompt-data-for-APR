### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` by looking for the keyword `'stash'` in the command script and checking if the stderr contains `'usage:'`.
2. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second element after splitting by whitespace. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the buggy function assumes there will always be at least 2 elements in the split `command.script`, leading to an `IndexError` when there is only 1 element.

### Bug Fix:
To correct the bug, we should first verify that the split list has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element. If the split list has less than 2 elements, then the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split `script_parts` list has at least 2 elements. If not, it will return `False` to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
