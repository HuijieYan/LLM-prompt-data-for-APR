### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the command script will always have at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. The bug occurs because in the failing test case, the command script only contains one element (`'git'`), leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`. Additionally, we need to make sure that the first element of the split script is `'git'` and that the command's stderr contains the string `'usage:`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` and ensuring that the first element is `'git'`, we can prevent the `IndexError` and correctly identify the command that needs to be matched.
