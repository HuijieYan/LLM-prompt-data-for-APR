## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test calls the `match` function with a `Command` object that has 'git' as the script and the relevant stashing error message in `stderr`.
3. The bug causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the `command.script` when there is only one word ('git') provided.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain multiple words to avoid accessing out-of-range indices.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the length of the split `command.script` before trying to access the second word.
2. If the length is insufficient, return `False`.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By adding the length check before accessing the second word in the `command.script`, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves correctly even with single-word scripts.
