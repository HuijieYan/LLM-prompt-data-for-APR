### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function splits the `command.script` by spaces and accesses the second element assuming it exists, which leads to an IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function tries to access the second element of the split script, which leads to an IndexError when the script is only 'git'. This is evident from the failing test since the script is 'git', and the function still tries to access index 1 of the split command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the split command has more than one element before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has more than one element before comparing it with 'stash'. This modification should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function work correctly even when the script is just 'git'.
