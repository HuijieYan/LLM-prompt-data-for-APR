### Analysis:
The failing test is checking for a scenario where the `git` command is invoked without any specific subcommand, resulting in an error message showing the general usage of the `git` command. The buggy function `match` is trying to split the script of the command and access the second element to check if it is `'stash'`. However, in this case, when the script is just `git`, splitting it will result in only one element in the list, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting the script, leading to the IndexError. In this specific case, when `git` command is invoked without a subcommand, the split operation results in a list with only one element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the script has more elements after splitting before trying to access the second element. This way, we can avoid the IndexError when there's only one element in the list after splitting.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    try:
        script_elements = command.script.split()
        return len(script_elements) >= 2 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    except IndexError:
        return False
```

The corrected version of the function first checks if the length of the `script_elements` list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element to compare it with `'stash'`. If the script cannot be split or there aren't enough elements, it will return `False`. This way, the corrected version will handle the case where the `git` command is invoked without a specific subcommand and prevent the IndexError.
