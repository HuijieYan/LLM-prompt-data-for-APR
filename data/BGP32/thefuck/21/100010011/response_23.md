### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `script` of the `command` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the `stderr` of the `command`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` where the `list index is out of range`.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
where `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the list created by splitting the `script`, causing an `IndexError` when the list is empty or has only one element.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` doesn't have a second word after splitting, resulting in an empty list. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue where the `script` was just `'git'` which results in the index out of range error while accessing the second element.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has sufficient elements before trying to access the second element. If the list has less than 2 elements after splitting, the function should return `False` to indicate that the input command does not match the expected condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

Now, the corrected version of the function checks if the split script has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This modification avoids the `IndexError` by ensuring the index access is safe.
