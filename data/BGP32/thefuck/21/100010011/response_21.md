### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and check if the second element is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` because the `command.script.split()` results in a list with length less than 2, therefore trying to access index 1 causes the error.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function assumes `command.script` will always have at least 2 elements when split, but in cases where the script is simply `'git'`, it will fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` has more than 1 element before trying to access index 1.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By first checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring. This fix ensures that the function will not raise an exception even when the `command.script` does not contain multiple elements.
