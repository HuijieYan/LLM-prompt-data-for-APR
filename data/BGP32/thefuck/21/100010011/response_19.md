### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `script` attribute of the `command` object is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### Error:
The error occurs when `command.script.split()` does not have a second element, and trying to access `[1]` results in the `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements obtained after splitting the `script`, then check the second element and `'stash'`, and finally check if `'usage:'` is present in the `stderr`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    
    return False
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`. This corrected function addresses the issue and should no longer raise the `IndexError`.
