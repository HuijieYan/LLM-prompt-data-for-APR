## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element of the split command script and check if it is equal to 'stash'. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that there are not enough elements in the split command script to access the second index.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function assumes that the split command script will always have at least two elements, which is not the case when the command input is just 'git'. This causes an IndexError when trying to access the second index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command script has enough elements before trying to access the second index. If there are not enough elements, we should return False to indicate that the command does not match.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if the number of script parts is more than 1 before accessing the second index. This prevents the IndexError and ensures that the function works correctly.
