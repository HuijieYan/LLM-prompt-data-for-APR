### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` and the failing test is expecting the `match` function to not match the command when the stderr contains `git_stash_err`. The error seems to be related to the `command.script.split()[1]` operation.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is at `command.script.split()[1]` where it tries to access the second element of the split list from the `command.script`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements after splitting. If the `command.script` is empty or only contains one element, trying to access the second element with index `1` will raise an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list from `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This way, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the list is empty or has only one element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts and then check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This modification prevents the `IndexError` and ensures that we only access the second element if it exists.
