### Analysis:
The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs when trying to access the 2nd element from the split list of the command script. This error indicates that the script does not have a second element, which results in an empty list causing the index out of range error.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
It's trying to access the second element of the split list from `command.script`, which may not always be present.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second element after splitting, causing the index out of range error. In this specific case from the issue description, the `command` received is just "git" without any further arguments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has enough elements to safely access the desired index. This can be done using a length check before accessing the index.

### Corrected Version:
Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts and then check if there are more than 1 elements in the split list. If there are, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in `command.stderr`. This way, we avoid the index out of range error.
