### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is meant to check if a git command is related to stashing based on the command script and error message.
2. The bug occurs due to the assumption that the script will always contain at least two elements when `split()` is called.
3. The bug is identified in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where an `IndexError` is raised when the script contains only one element.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Correction Explanation:
- In the fixed version, we first split the command script into parts and check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.
- If the script contains at least two elements, then we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash'.
- This correction ensures that the script splitting is safe from causing errors and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
