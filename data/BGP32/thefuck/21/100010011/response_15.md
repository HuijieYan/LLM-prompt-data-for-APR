### Analysis:
The buggy function `match()` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The error message shows that the function is failing with an `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that `command.script.split()` is an empty list, hence accessing the second element results in an error.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` where `command.script.split()` is causing the IndexError.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused when the `command.script` does not have any content to split into a list. This happens when the script is only 'git' without any additional arguments. In this case, `command.script.split()[1]` will throw an IndexError because there is no second element in an empty list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script.split()` has any elements before trying to access the second element. We should also ensure that the script contains at least 2 words before checking the elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
