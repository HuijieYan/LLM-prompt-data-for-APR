### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by space and then check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in cases where the `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting by space will result in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the `command.script` by space. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is only one element in the resulting list, causing the `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in `script_parts`. We then check if the length of `script_parts` is less than 2. If this is the case, we return `False` to signify that the condition for the rule is not met. Otherwise, we proceed with the existing logic to check if the second element is `'stash'`.

This corrected version should address the `IndexError` and make the function work as expected for cases where there are not enough elements after splitting the `command.script`.
