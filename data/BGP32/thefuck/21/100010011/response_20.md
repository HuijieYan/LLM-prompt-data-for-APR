### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the script of the `command` object and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, when the script is just `'git'`, splitting it results in an empty list which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access index `1`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the split operation on an empty script results in an empty list and trying to access index `1` on an empty list raises an IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the script is split into at least two parts before trying to access index `1`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before attempting to access index `1`. This change ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.
