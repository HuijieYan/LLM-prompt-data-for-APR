### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's standard error. The error message is indicating an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that trying to access the second element of the split command script is causing the issue when the command script is just 'git' without any additional words.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function assumes there will always be at least two words in the command script. When the command script is just 'git', accessing the second index of the split array causes an IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the command script has at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This can be done by first checking if the split command script has at least two elements before comparing the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we split the command script first and then check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This modification prevents the IndexError when the command script has fewer than two words.
