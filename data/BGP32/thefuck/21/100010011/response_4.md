### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `script` attribute of the `command` object is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurred because the `script` attribute did not have a second word in it when the script was just 'git'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `script` attribute of the `command` object does not have multiple words, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word that doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can first check if the `script` attribute split into words has at least two elements before checking the second word. If there are not enough elements, we can return `False` immediately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the `script` attribute has at least two words before proceeding to check if the second word is 'stash'. If there are not enough words, it will return `False` immediately. This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` issue and pass the failing test.
