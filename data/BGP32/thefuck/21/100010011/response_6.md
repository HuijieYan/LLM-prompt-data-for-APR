### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `.split()` method might be failing if the command is just 'git' without any arguments following it.
2. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might cause an IndexError if there are not enough elements in the split list.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails when the `command.script.split()` method does not return enough elements to access the index 1. This leads to an IndexError when trying to compare the second element with 'stash'.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the split list does not have at least two elements before trying to access the second index for comparison. We can check the length of the split list before performing this comparison.

### Bug-fixed Version:
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and
            split_command[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fixed version checks if there are more than one element in the split command before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This modification ensures that we avoid the IndexError when accessing out-of-bound indices.
