Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when the `git_fix_stash` rule is executed with a `git` command but not followed by any arguments. This triggers the `IndexError: list index out of range` because splitting the command script results in an empty list, causing an attempt to access an element that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the command script does not have enough elements.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the `git_fix_stash` rule function correctly in cases where the `git` command is used without any arguments.
