## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. The error message suggests that `command.script.split()` is causing an `IndexError`, indicating that the split operation might be resulting in an empty list.

The corresponding GitHub issue also mentions that this bug occurs when the script is just 'git'. In such cases, splitting an empty string would result in an empty list causing the IndexError.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by splitting an empty string when the command script is just 'git'. This results in an empty list, and trying to access the second item from this empty list causes an IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split operation does not result in an empty list. We can check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script into a list of words and then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This modification ensures that we avoid the IndexError when splitting an empty command script.
