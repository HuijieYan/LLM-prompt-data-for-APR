### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is designed to match a command that contains `git stash` in its script and has the string `'usage:'` in the stderr.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by trying to access an index that does not exist in the list returned by `command.script.split()`.
3. The bug in the function is that it assumes there will always be at least two elements in the list returned by `split()`, which leads to an `IndexError` when that assumption is wrong.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function assumes that splitting the `command.script` by whitespace will always result in at least two elements, one of which being `'stash'`. However, if the script is just `'git'`, splitting it will result in only one element, causing the index out of range error when trying to access index `1`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check the length of the list after splitting the `command.script` before trying to access index `1`. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the list contains fewer elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

The corrected version checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This change ensures that the index does not go out of range and fixes the bug.
