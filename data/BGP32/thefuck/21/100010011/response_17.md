### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.
- The error message indicates that the list index is out of range when attempting to access `command.script.split()[1]`. This happens when the `command.script` does not contain more than one word.
- The provided GitHub issue also specifies that the rule fails when the script is just 'git', which aligns with the error message.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` has more than one word, which is incorrect when the script is just 'git'.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to handle the case when `command.script` does not contain multiple words to prevent the IndexError.
- We can add a check to ensure that there are enough elements in the split list before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the split list has more than one element before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError and fix the bug.
