### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element of the split command script using `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in cases where the script is just `'git'`, it will raise a `IndexError` because there is no second element to be accessed.

The GitHub issue provides a clear explanation of this problem, where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `'git'`, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` in cases where the script contains only one element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the script into a list of elements and then check if the length of this list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This fix ensures that the function does not raise an `IndexError` when the script contains only one element.
