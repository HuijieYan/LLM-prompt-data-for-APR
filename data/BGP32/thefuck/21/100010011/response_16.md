### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is failing due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. The function is trying to access the second element of the split list created from `command.script`, assuming that it exists. However, in cases where there is only one element in the split list, this causes the index to be out of range.

The error message and the GitHub issue point out that the problem occurs when the script is just "git", which results in an empty split list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the split list has only one element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version:
- First, we split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`.
- Then, we check if `script_parts` has at least two elements, and if so, we proceed to check if the second element is `'stash'`.
- Finally, we also check if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.

This corrected version ensures that the index is within range before trying to access the second element of the split list.
