### Analysis:
- The buggy function in `git_fix_stash.py` is supposed to match the command if it contains the word 'stash' in the script and the 'usage:' keyword in the stderr.
- The error occurred due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script, which failed because the split resulted in an empty list.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug happened because the function assumed that there will always be at least two elements in the split `command.script`. When the script is just 'git', splitting it results in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command script has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If not, the condition should return False.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if there are at least two elements in the split command script before accessing index 1, we avoid the `IndexError` that was previously occurring. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
