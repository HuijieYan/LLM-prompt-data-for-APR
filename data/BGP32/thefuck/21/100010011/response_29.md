### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` caused by trying to access index 1 of the splitted script which isn't available.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the script will always have enough tokens after being split by whitespace. In the failing test, when the script is just `'git'` with no additional tokens, splitting the script will result in an empty list, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough tokens after splitting the script before trying to access index 1. We can add a condition to check if the list has at least 2 elements before comparing index 1 to 'stash'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_tokens = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_tokens) > 1 and script_tokens[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
