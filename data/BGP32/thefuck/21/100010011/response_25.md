### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` stating that the list index is out of range. This error occurs when trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.
3. The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two words in `command.script` after splitting by whitespace. However, in cases where `command.script` is just 'git', splitting it would result in a list with only one element (index 0), thereby leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split command script list before accessing index 1.
5. By checking the length of the split command script list and ensuring it is greater than 1 before comparing with 'stash', we can prevent the IndexError.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command script list first, we ensure that the buggy function does not try to access an index that does not exist, thus preventing the `IndexError` and resolving the bug.
