### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The function is failing with an `IndexError` because it directly performs `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split list has at least 2 elements.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails with the error message `IndexError: list index out of range` because it assumes that there will always be at least two words in `command.script` when splitting it. This assumption is not valid for cases where the script is just `'git'`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. In such cases, trying to access index 1 directly using `command.script.split()[1]` leads to the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and the function should work correctly even when the script is just `'git'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version above, we first split the `command.script` into words and store it in `script_words`. Then, we check if `script_words` has more than one element, and only if it has, we proceed with the comparison. This prevents the `IndexError` and ensures that the function works as intended.
