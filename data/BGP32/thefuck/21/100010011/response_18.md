### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word, causing an `IndexError`.
3. The bug is related to the issue reported on GitHub. When the `command.script` is just 'git' without any additional arguments, the `IndexError` is raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `command.script` does not have a second word.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can first check if the `command.script` has more than one word before attempting to access the second word. If not, we can return `False` immediately instead of raising an `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

Now, with this corrected version, the function will return `False` if the `command.script` does not have a second word, preventing the `IndexError` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
