## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when splitting the script by spaces.

## Identified Issue
The issue arises when the `command.script` does not have at least 2 words after splitting by spaces. In this case, attempting to access index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.

## Suggested Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to check if there are enough words in the split script before trying to access index 1. We should also ensure that we handle cases where the script does not contain the word "stash" to avoid unnecessary errors.

## Code Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing index 1, we prevent the IndexError. Additionally, this modification avoids unnecessary processing if the second word is not 'stash'.
