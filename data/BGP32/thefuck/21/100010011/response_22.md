### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` in `command.script.split()[1]`.
3. The GitHub issue states that when the script is just `'git'`, the rule fails due to the same error.
4. The bug occurs because the code assumes that there will always be at least two words in the `command.script`, which might not be the case.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the split command is executed only if there are enough words in `command.script` to avoid the `IndexError`. We should also handle the case when there are not enough words.

### The Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first storing the split script into a variable and checking its length, we prevent the `IndexError` by ensuring that there are enough words before trying to access index 1. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
