### Analysis:
The buggy function is expected to match a command that starts with "git stash" and has the word "usage:" in the stderr. The error occurs when the command only contains "git" without any arguments following it, causing the IndexError due to trying to access index 1 of an empty list after splitting the command script.

### Potential Error Location:
- The line causing the error is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where the split function is called without checking if there are enough elements in the resulting list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused when the command script does not contain any arguments after "git," leading to an empty list after splitting the script. Accessing index 1 of this empty list triggers the IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the list resulting from splitting the script has at least 2 elements before attempting to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring when there are no arguments following "git."

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and stores the resulting list in `script_parts`. It then checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1 to compare it with 'stash'. This modification ensures that the function does not result in an IndexError when there are no arguments following "git."
