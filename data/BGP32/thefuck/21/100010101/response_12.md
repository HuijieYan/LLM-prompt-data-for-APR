The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the list obtained by splitting the command script. However, in cases where the script doesn't contain multiple elements, this causes an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split script has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.
