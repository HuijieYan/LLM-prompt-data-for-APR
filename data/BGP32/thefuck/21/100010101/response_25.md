The buggy function is attempting to check if the second element in the command script equals 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr. The error message indicates an IndexError, implying that the split operation on the command script did not result in a second element. This means that the command script does not have more than one element to access at index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the command script is split correctly and then check if the split has at least two elements before accessing the index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if the split operation results in at least two elements before accessing index 1 to compare with 'stash'. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
