### Analysis
The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the `match` function, specifically when trying to access index 1 of the split command script. The expected input parameters include a command script that does not contain the word 'stash'. The function is attempting to split the script and directly access index 1 without checking the length of the split result first.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function assumes that the script will always have at least one element after splitting. When the script is not related to 'stash', the split result will only have one element (index 0) which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

### Fix
Add a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If it doesn't, return False.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
