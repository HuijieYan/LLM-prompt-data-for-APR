The buggy function is checking if the second element of the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr. The bug is caused when trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it actually exists.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element, preventing the "IndexError: list index out of range" from occurring.
