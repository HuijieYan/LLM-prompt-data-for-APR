The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, the function does not handle cases where the script may not contain enough elements after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has enough elements before accessing the second element to prevent the `IndexError`. We can also add a check to ensure that 'stash' is present in the split script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split script has more than 1 element, then it proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and fix the bug.
