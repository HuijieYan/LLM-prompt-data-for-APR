The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute, assuming it has multiple parts separated by whitespaces. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which does not contain any additional parts after splitting, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will ensure that an `IndexError` is avoided by first checking if the split list has enough elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.
