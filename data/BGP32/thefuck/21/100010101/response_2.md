The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, in the failing test case, the command script consists only of a single element 'git', leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this issue, we need to first ensure that the script is split into a list of words before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if the split command script has less than 2 elements before proceeding to check if the second element is 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function behaves correctly for the given input.
