### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the `split()` operation on `command.script` is not returning enough elements to access index 1. This could happen when the command script does not contain multiple words.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `split()` operation on `command.script` is assuming multiple words but not handling the case where there is only one word.

### Fix
We need to check if there are enough words in the `command.script` before trying to access index 1 to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version first checks if there are enough elements in `splited_script` before trying to access index 1, which resolves the `IndexError` issue.
