The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` attribute at spaces and then check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` attribute doesn't contain any spaces, resulting in an empty list after splitting, leading to an "IndexError: list index out of range" when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains any spaces before splitting it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    
    return False
```

This corrected version first checks if the `command.script` can be split into parts before trying to access the second element. If the split results in at least two parts, it proceeds with the comparison. If not, it returns `False`.

This fix ensures that the function does not encounter an IndexError and correctly identifies whether the command being checked is related to stashing changes in git.
