## Fixing the buggy function

### Problem:
The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the script doesn't have enough elements to split.

### Solution:
We should first check if the split command has more than one element before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking if `len(splited_script) >= 2`, we are ensuring that there are at least 2 elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
