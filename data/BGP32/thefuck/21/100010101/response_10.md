The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the list resulting from splitting the `command.script`. However, the error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range". This error occurs when trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` can be split into multiple elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts and then accesses the second element only if it exists. This fix should resolve the "IndexError: list index out of range" issue and make the function work correctly for the expected input/output values.
