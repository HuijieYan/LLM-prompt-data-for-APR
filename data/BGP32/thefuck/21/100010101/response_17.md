### Explanation:
The buggy function is trying to split the command script and check if the second part is `'stash'`. However, it is not checking if there are enough elements in the split list before accessing the second element. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splitted_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that we do not encounter an `IndexError`.
