The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error occurs when there are not enough elements in the split script.

The bug is caused by assuming that the `split` operation will always create at least 2 resulting elements, which is not the case when the script is 'git' without any additional arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split script before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This correction ensures that the split operation has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. Now the function should pass the failing test case and handle cases where the script has only one element.
