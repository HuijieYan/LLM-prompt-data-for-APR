The buggy function is trying to split the command script and extract the second element to compare with 'stash'. However, the script seems to have only one element, so trying to access the second element is causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if there are enough elements in the split result before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This correction first splits the script and then checks if there are more than 1 element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.
