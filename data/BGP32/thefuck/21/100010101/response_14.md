### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command's script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an 'IndexError: list index out of range', suggesting that the split operation in the buggy function does not produce the expected output.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the script is being split without specifying a delimiter, causing it to be split into individual characters instead of words. This results in the `split()[1]` operation trying to access an index that does not exist, leading to the IndexError.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to split the script using whitespace as the delimiter so that we get a list of words. Then we can safely access the second word (index 1). Additionally, we should check if the split script has at least two elements before checking the second word.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(splited_script) > 1
        and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```
