The bug in the provided function is due to the assumption that the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts, and then trying to access the second part directly without checking if it exists. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split result is long enough to access the second part safely. If it is not, then the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there are enough parts after splitting the script before accessing the second part. This fix will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring in cases where the script cannot be split into multiple parts.
