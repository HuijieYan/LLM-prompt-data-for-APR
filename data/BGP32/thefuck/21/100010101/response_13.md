The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the buggy function is assuming that `command.script` will always have at least two words, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` has enough words before trying to access the second word. If not, we can safely return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks the length of `splited_script` before trying to access the second word. If the length is less than 2, it immediately returns `False`.
