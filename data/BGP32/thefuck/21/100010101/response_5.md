The bug in the function `match` is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements when split by whitespace. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the element at index 1 without checking the length of the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` is split into multiple elements before trying to access index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will split the `command.script` into multiple elements and then check if there are at least two elements (`len(splited_script) > 1`) before accessing index 1. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` that occurred in the failing test case.
