### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` only contains `'git'`, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by spaces. In this case, when `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is only one element in the resulting list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` list is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
