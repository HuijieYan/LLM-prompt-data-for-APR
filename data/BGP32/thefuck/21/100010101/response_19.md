The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. The error occurs because the `command.script` does not contain multiple elements to split.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function assumes that `command.script` will have multiple elements to split using whitespace. 
- In the failing test case, `command.script` is only `'git'`, causing the `command.script.split()[1]` to raise an `IndexError` since there is only one element in the list after splitting.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to handle the case where `command.script` does not contain more than one element after splitting.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of the split list, we ensure that the function does not raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element. This correction allows the function to return `False` when there is no second element in the split list, fixing the bug.
