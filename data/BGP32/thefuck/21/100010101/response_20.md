The buggy function is attempting to split the command script by whitespaces and check if the second element is 'stash', while also checking if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error occurs when the script does not contain more than one element after splitting by whitespaces, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split script has a length of at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least two elements before proceeding to check if the second element is 'stash', preventing the IndexError.
