The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command script to check if it is equal to 'stash'. However, in the failing test case, the command script only contains one element ('git'), leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the split script has only one element. We can modify the function to first check if the split script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will now first ensure that the split script has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError and address the bug.
