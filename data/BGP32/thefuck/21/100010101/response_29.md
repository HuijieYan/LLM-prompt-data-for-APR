### Correction of the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` and checking if the resulting list has at least two elements, we can avoid the `IndexError` that occurs when accessing an element that does not exist. This correction ensures that the function behaves correctly for the provided test case and other similar cases.
