The bug in the current function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts using the space character, and then accessing the second part without checking if it actually exists. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list.

To fix this bug, we should first check if there are enough parts after splitting the `command.script` before trying to access the second part. If there are not enough parts, then the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False

    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if there are at least 2 parts after splitting the `command.script`. If not, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic of checking if the second part is `'stash'` and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.
