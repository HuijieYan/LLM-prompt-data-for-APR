The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command script, which is causing an IndexError when it doesn't exist. Additionally, the condition to check for `'usage:'` in the command stderr is imprecise and may lead to incorrect matches.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to check if the split command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.
2. We should check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        script_parts = command.script.split()
        if script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return True
    return False
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the script is split correctly and checks for 'git stash' and 'usage:' in the appropriate places before attempting to access elements.
