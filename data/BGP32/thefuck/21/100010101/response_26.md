The bug in the `match` function is caused by trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()` without checking if the list has at least 2 elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when the list has fewer elements.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. If not, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function will not raise an `IndexError`. This correction will make the function behave as expected in the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
