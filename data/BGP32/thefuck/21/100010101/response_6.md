The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash', and whether the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which occurs when trying to split an empty script.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the script is being split by whitespaces without checking if the script actually contains any elements to split.
2. In the failing case, the script is empty ('git'), causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We need to first check if the script has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.
2. Modify the logic to check if the command's script starts with 'git stash' instead of splitting it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
