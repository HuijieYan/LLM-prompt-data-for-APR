### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the script and stderr of the input command. The error occurs when trying to access the second element of the split script since the script might not have more than one element. This causes an `IndexError`.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always have multiple elements after splitting, which may not be the case.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if the split command has enough elements before trying to access the second one. This can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the split command has more than one element to avoid the `IndexError`. If there are enough elements, it proceeds with the comparison; otherwise, it returns `False`.
