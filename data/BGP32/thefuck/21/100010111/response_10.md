## Analyze the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command relates to `git stash` and if the error message contains the word 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs because it tries to split the command script without checking its length first, causing an `IndexError`.

The expected input for the buggy function is a Command object where the script is 'git' and the error message contains the 'usage:' line. The buggy function is not handling the case where the script does not have multiple parts due to the split function causing the IndexError.

The GitHub issue describes this bug, showing how the function fails when the command script is just 'git'.

## Identify potential error locations
The potential error lies in the line where the split function is used without validating the length of the split list, causing an IndexError.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script will always have multiple parts after splitting, but this is not the case when the script is just 'git', leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough parts in the split command script before trying to access specific elements. This can be done by verifying the length of the split list first to avoid the IndexError.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `parts` before accessing `parts[1]`, we can prevent the IndexError. This corrected version ensures that the split command script has at least 2 parts before trying to access the second part for comparison.
