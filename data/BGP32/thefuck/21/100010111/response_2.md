### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains `'usage:'`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which suggests that `command.script.split()` is throwing this error when the list is empty.
- The expected input values show that `command.script` is just `'git'`, which will result in an empty list after splitting.
- The GitHub issue also mentions that this bug occurs when the script is just `'git'`, causing the list index out of range error.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to add a check to ensure that the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.
- We can also add a check to handle cases where the first word is not `'git'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script by spaces
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the first word is 'git' and there are more than 1 words in the script
    if len(splitted_script) >= 2 and splitted_script[0] == 'git':
        return (splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    
    return False
```

With this corrected version, we are ensuring that the split list has at least 2 elements and the first word is 'git' before accessing the second word. This will prevent the `IndexError` and handle cases where the script is just 'git'.
