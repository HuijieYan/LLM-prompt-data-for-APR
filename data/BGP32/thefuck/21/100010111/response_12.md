## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script` split by space is equal to `'stash'`, and if the `stderr` of the `command` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, the buggy function causes an `IndexError` if the `command.script` doesn't contain more than one element to split, which happens when the script is just `'git'`.

## Bug in the Code
The bug in the code occurs due to the assumption that the `command.script` will always have more than one element when split by space. This assumption causes an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`, as it won't have index `1`.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the index `1`. We should also maintain the check for `'usage:'` in the `stderr`. By ensuring that the script is 'git' and that stderr contains 'usage:', we will only return True for actual stash commands.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if the length of the split script is at least 2 before attempting to access index 1. This prevents the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy function.
