## Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `match` is expected to check if the second word of the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' appears in the `command.stderr`. However, the buggy function is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range`. The error message indicates that the split operation on `command.script` is resulting in an empty list, and trying to access the second element of an empty list leads to this index error.

## Explanation of the bug

The buggy function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain more than one word, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'. Since trying to access the second index of a split on a string that only has one word leads to the index error, the bug occurs. The bug arises because the condition check in the `match` function is not handling the case where the script has only one word.

## Fixing the bug

To address this bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This change ensures that we handle the case where the script consists of only one word.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script and store it in `split_script`. Then, we make sure that the length of `split_script` is at least 2 before proceeding to check if the second element is 'stash'. This modification prevents the index error in scenarios where the script has fewer than 2 words.
