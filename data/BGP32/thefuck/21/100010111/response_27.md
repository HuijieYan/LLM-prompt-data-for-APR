## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. The issue arises when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, as in this case, `command.script.split()` would result in `['git']` and trying to access index 1 would raise an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to assuming that there will always be at least 2 elements in the split list, which is not true for the input `'git'`. This assumption leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. We can check the length of the split list before performing this access.

## Correction
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version of the function first splits the `command.script` and stores it in `splited_script`. Then, it checks if the length of `splited_script` is greater than 1 before attempting to access index 1, ensuring that an IndexError will not occur.
