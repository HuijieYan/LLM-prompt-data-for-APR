## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by space and check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element after splitting.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have more than one element after splitting by space. In this specific case where `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is only one element in the split result leading to an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are multiple elements after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the split result has fewer elements than anticipated.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking if the length of `splited_script` is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`, we ensure that the `IndexError` is avoided and the function behaves correctly even when `command.script` has no additional elements after splitting.
