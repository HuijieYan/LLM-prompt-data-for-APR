## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word `'stash'` and if the stderr contains the word `'usage:'`. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have the necessary split command to retrieve the second element, leading to an `IndexError` in the code.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is only `'git'` without containing any other elements to split. When trying to access the second element of the split script in the `match` function, an `IndexError` is raised.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is sufficient before accessing the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can assume that the required element does not exist, and simply return `False`.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the script first and then checking if the length is greater than 1, we ensure that we can safely access the second element without encountering an `IndexError`. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and fulfill the expected behavior.
