## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The error occurs when the script only contains a single word, for example, 'git'. In this case, trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` results in an IndexError since there is no second element in the list. This error is then reflected in the failing test where the script is just 'git'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the script contains more than one word before trying to access the second word. We can modify the function to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring for single-word scripts like 'git'. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and handle such cases properly.
