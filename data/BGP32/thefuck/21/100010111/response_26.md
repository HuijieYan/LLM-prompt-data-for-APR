### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` which suggests that the script is empty when split by whitespaces.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the command.script is just 'git' without any additional arguments. In this case, the split function will return a list with only one element ('git'), and trying to access the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If the list has only one element, it means there are no additional arguments after 'git'. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and then check if the split list has more than one element. If it does, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` when the script only has one word like 'git'.
