## Analysis
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 8 of the function because `command.script.split()` does not have a second element, causing an index out of range error.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script.split()` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also check if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr` to ensure a correct match.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function first checks if the split script has at least two elements, then proceeds to check if the second element is `'stash'`. It also verifies if `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly.
