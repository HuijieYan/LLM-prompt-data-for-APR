Based on the provided information, the bug occurs when the `split()` method is called on the `command.script` which is only `'git'`, resulting in an empty list. Therefore, accessing index `[1]` of an empty list causes an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` contains more than one element before trying to access index `[1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the split command is stored in a variable `splited_script`, and we check its length to ensure that it has at least 2 elements before accessing index `[1]`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` that occurred before.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test case and also satisfy the expected input/output values.
