## Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function is designed to check if the git command in `command.script` is related to stashing changes. Specifically, it checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The function seems to be failing to handle cases where the `command.script` does not include multiple words.

The error message is `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

## Potential error locations
- The function assumes splitting the `command.script` on whitespaces will always result in multiple indexes, leading to the `IndexError`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when the `command.script` contains only one word (for example, 'git') which results in a single element list after splitting. Accessing index 1 on this single-element list causes the `IndexError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the list resulting from splitting `command.script` contains more than one element before accessing index 1. This will prevent the `IndexError` when there is only one element in the list.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store it in `splited_script`. Then, we check if the length of `splited_script` is greater than 1 before checking the second element. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when accessing index 1 in a single-element list.
