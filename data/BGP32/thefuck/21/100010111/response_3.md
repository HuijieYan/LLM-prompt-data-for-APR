## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the message "list index out of range". This error occurred at `command.script.split()[1]`, meaning the script did not contain a second word to split. This issue was discussed on GitHub in an issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git".

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `command.script` is only `'git'` in the failing test, and when that is split using `.split()`, it results in `['git']`, which does not have an index of `1`. This results in the `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if there is at least one word after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second word. If there is only one word, we should consider this case as not a match.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` before trying to access the second word, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works correctly even when the script contains just one word.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and handle cases where `command.script` has only one word.
