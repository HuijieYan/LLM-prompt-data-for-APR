## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is designed to check if the given command is related to stashing in Git by looking for the `stash` keyword in the second position of the script split and the existence of the 'usage:' keyword in the stderr. However, the error occurs when the script is only `'git'` without any additional arguments, leading to an `IndexError` because there is no second element after splitting the script.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the command is just `'git'`, the split list only contains one element (`['git']`) and trying to access the second element results in an `IndexError`. The function is not handling this edge case where there are not enough elements after splitting the script.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should first check that the split script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. If the split script has less than 2 elements, the function should return `False`, signifying that the command does not match the criteria for stashing in Git.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script and check if the length of the split script is at least 2. If it is, then we proceed to check the conditions for matching the stash command. Otherwise, we directly return `False`.
