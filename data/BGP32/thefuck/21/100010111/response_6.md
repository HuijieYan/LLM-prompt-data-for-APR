## Analysis
The buggy function is a `match` function for the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains the word 'usage:'. The error that is raised is an `IndexError` indicating that the list index is out of range.

Looking at the function, the issue is with assuming that the `command.script` will have at least two words when splitting. If the `command.script` has only one word, accessing index `1` will raise an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming the `command.script` will always have more than one word when splitting. The error occurs when the script has only one word.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough words in the script before trying to access index 1.

## The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we first split the `command.script`, then check if the length of the split words is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring.
