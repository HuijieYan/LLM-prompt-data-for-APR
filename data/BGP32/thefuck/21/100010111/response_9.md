## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is checking if the second element of the split command script is equal to "stash" and if "usage:" is present in the command's stderr. The error occurs when the script is just "git", leading to a IndexError because there is no second element after splitting.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the command script. When the script is "git", there is only one element in the list after splitting, leading to the IndexError.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements after splitting before accessing the second element in the list.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check to ensure that there are at least two elements after splitting the script, we prevent the IndexError when the script is just "git". This corrected version will pass the failing test and handle the scenario when the script is only "git".
