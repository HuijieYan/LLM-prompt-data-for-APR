## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second element of the `command.script` split by spaces is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The bug occurs because `command.script` may not have a second element when it is only `'git'`.
3. The bug leads to an `IndexError` due to attempting to access the second element of a list that doesn't exist, leading to a comparison failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second one.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the script has at least two elements and 'stash' is the second one, and 'usage:' is in stderr
    return (len(command.script.split()) >= 2 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the fixed version, we first verify that the split of `command.script` has at least 2 elements before checking the condition involving the second one. This change will prevent the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.
