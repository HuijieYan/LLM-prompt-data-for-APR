The buggy function is designed to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr. The issue arises when the command script doesn't contain any other words besides 'git', leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second item in the split command script.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to add a check to ensure that the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that the split script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Now, the function should be able to handle cases where the script consists of only 'git', preventing the IndexError.
