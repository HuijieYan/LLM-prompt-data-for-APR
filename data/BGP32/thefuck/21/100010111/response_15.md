## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then access the first index. The function assumes that there will always be at least one element in the split list, leading to an `IndexError` when the list is empty.

The error message indicates that the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and the `split()` operation results in an empty list. This causes the function to fail when trying to access the first element in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has any elements before trying to access the first index. If the list is empty, we should not proceed with the comparison.

## Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the split list has more than one element before trying to access the index `1`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` by avoiding the access to an index that might not exist.
