## Analysis
- The buggy function is designed to check if the command to be fixed by `git_fix_stash` is related to `git stash` and if the `usage:` message is present in the error output.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring in the function due to trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` list, which doesn't exist when the script is just `'git'`.
- The expected behavior for this function should return False if the script is not related to git stash.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the function to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before checking the second element, so it won't throw an `IndexError`.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
