## Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `match` is designed to check whether the input command is related to checking the usage of a git stash. The function splits the input command script and checks if the second element is equal to 'stash', and also verifies if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is the expression `command.script.split()[1]`, where the script split might not have a second element, leading to the `IndexError`.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the script will always have at least two elements after splitting based on whitespace. If the script is only 'git', splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing index out of range error when trying to access the second element. The error message clearly indicates this issue.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is split only when there are enough elements to access. We can check the length of the split list before trying to access the second element.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first split the `command.script` and store it in `split_script`.
- Then, we check if the length of the `split_script` is greater than 1 to ensure there is a second element available.
- Next, we check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

This corrected version will handle the edge case where the script contains only one element like 'git', preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
