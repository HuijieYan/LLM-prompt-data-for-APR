### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second element in the `command.script` split by spaces is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` which occurs when trying to access an index that does not exist in the list.
3. In the failing test case, the input `command.script` is `'git'`, and when split, it results in a list `['git']`. Accessing index 1 in this list will lead to an out-of-range error.
4. To fix the bug, the function should check if the split script has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if the length of the split script is sufficient before accessing index 1.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the code does not error out due to an out-of-range index access.

The corrected version of the function should successfully pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected values and types of variables.
