### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine if the `git stash` command was called based on the input `command`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to be split, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

### Potential error locations
The error is likely occurring in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where an IndexError can be raised if the split result does not have enough elements.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs due to assuming that the split result will always have at least two elements to access the second element. In cases where the script is only `'git'`, this assumption leads to an IndexError.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has enough elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script if it contains any elements
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the split script contains at least two elements and whether the first part is 'git' and the second part is 'stash'
    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script`. Then, we check if the split script contains at least two elements and if the first part is `'git'` and the second part is `'stash'`. If these conditions are met, we proceed with checking `usage:` in the `command.stderr`. If the conditions are not met, we return `False`. This fix ensures that we do not encounter an IndexError when splitting the script.
