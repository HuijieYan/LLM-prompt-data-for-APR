## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the split `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`. Since the `command.script` in this case is just `'git'`, splitting it creates a list with only one element. Accessing the second element of this list causes an `IndexError`.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split list is greater than or equal to 2 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

With this fix, the function will first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script is just `'git'`.
