## Analysis
The buggy function is implemented to check if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The error arises from accessing the second element of the split `command.script`, which may result in an `IndexError` when the `command.script` does not have enough elements to retrieve the second one.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to assuming that `command.script` always has at least two words, but in some cases, it may not, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to validate the length of the split `command.script` array before trying to access the second element. If the length is at least 2, the function should proceed with the comparison, else it should return `False`.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script`, then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing for the word `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function won't encounter an `IndexError`.
