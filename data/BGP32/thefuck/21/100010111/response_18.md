## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expecting the second word in `command.script` to be `'stash'` and also checking if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to split it into words.

## Bug
The cause of the bug is that the code is assuming there will always be a second word in `command.script`, but when the script is just `'git'`, there is no second word to split, leading to the `IndexError`. This is not handled properly and causes the function to fail.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has at least 2 words before trying to access the second word. If there are not enough words, the function should return `False`. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

## Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By making this change, even when the command script is just `'git'`, the function will return `False` and not raise an `IndexError`, fixing the bug.
