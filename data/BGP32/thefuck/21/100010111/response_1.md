### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error occurs when `command.script` does not have a second word, causing an `IndexError`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The `split` operation on `command.script` might cause an IndexError if `command.script` does not have multiple words.
2. The comparison of the second word from `command.script` with 'stash' can cause issues.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused when `command.script` only contains one word, and the function attempts to access the second word by performing `split` operation. This leads to `IndexError` as there is no element at index `1` in the list generated by `split()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can first check if `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word. This can be done using a conditional statement to check the length of the list created by splitting `command.script`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second element, we avoid the `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle cases where `command.script` may not have the second word present.
