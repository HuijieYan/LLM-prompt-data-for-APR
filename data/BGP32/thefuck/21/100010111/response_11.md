The buggy function is attempting to split the command script using whitespace as a delimiter and then accessing the second element in the resulting list. However, the input command script may not always contain at least two elements, leading to an "IndexError: list index out of range" when trying to access an element that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we should return False to indicate that the command does not match the expected pattern.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) >= 2 
        and split_script[1] == 'stash' 
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This version first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the resulting list is at least 2 before proceeding with the other conditions. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly for all cases, including the one described in the failing test.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding the "git_fix_stash" rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
