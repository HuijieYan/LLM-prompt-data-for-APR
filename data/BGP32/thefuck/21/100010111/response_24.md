## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the second element of the split script from the command is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the bug occurs when the script is just 'git', causing an IndexError because there is no second element in the split script.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not checking the length of the split script before trying to access the second element directly.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before proceeding to compare the second element with 'stash' and checking for 'usage:' in stderr.
