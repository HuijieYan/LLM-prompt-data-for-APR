## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the script of the given command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.
2. The test case `test_not_match` passes a Command object with script set to 'git' and stderr containing the usage information for git stash.
3. The expected behavior is for the function to return False in this case.
4. The bug occurs because the function assumes the script will have a second word to check, leading to an IndexError when splitting the script into words.
5. The fix involves checking if the script exists and has at least two words before accessing the second word.

## Solution
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script
    if len(script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
