### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the `stderr` contains 'usage:'. This rule is specifically designed to match when the user incorrectly inputs `git help stash`.
2. The failing test is asserting that the `match` function should not recognize the command script "git" with `stderr` containing the usage of `git stash` commands.
3. The bug occurs when the `command.script` is not providing the second word due to `split` causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where there might not be a second word in the command script by checking if split is returning more than one element.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` that was causing the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly match the intended scenario for the rule.
