## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expected to check if the second element of the split command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr of the command. However, an error occurs when the command script does not have a second element, leading to a 'list index out of range' error.

## Errors
The error arises from the assumption that the split command script will always have at least two elements, which is not the case when the command script is just 'git' in the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to add additional checks to ensure that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

## The Corrected Version

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of the split command script before accessing the second element, the corrected function should now handle cases where the split script may not have a second element, resolving the 'list index out of range' error.
