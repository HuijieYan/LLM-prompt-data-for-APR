## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` passes a `Command` object with only `stderr` set to `git_stash_err`, which contains the usage information for `git stash`.
3. The bug occurs when the `command.script` has only one word, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

## Bug Fix Strategy
Modify the `match` function to first check if `command.script` split results in at least two elements before proceeding with further checks.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if the length of `split_script` is at least 2 elements, we prevent the `IndexError` when accessing the second element of the list.
