### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script` split by whitespace is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is passing a `Command` object with `script` as 'git' and `stderr` containing the git stash error message.
3. The failing test expects the `match` function to return `False` since the `command.script` does not have 'stash' as the second element, resulting in a `list index out of range` error in the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the `command.script` does not have enough elements to check for 'stash'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting by whitespace. In cases where the `command.script` is just 'git', there is no second element, causing the `list index out of range` error.

### Fix:
We need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element to compare it with 'stash'. If the split does not contain enough elements, we can return `False`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected function uses the `splited_script` variable to store the result of `command.script.split()` and then checks if it contains at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This correction ensures that the function will not throw an error when the split list doesn't have enough elements.
