## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command is related to stashing in Git by looking for the keyword "stash" in the script and the presence of "usage:" in the standard error output.
2. The bug occurs due to assuming the presence of at least two elements after splitting the command script. If the script consists of only one element (e.g., "git"), an `IndexError` will be raised.
3. The failing test case provides a command with script "git" and an error message that contains the expected usage info for stashing.
4. To fix the bug, the function should first check if the script parameter has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
5. It is also necessary to handle cases where the script does not contain the keyword "stash" to return `False` in those cases.

## Bug Fix
```python
from thefuck.rules import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) >= 2 
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `match` function checks that the `script_parts` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. It returns `True` only if the script contains "stash" and the error message contains the expected usage info.
