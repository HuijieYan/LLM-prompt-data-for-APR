## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second argument in the `git` command is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the stderr. The buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two elements in the split list of the `command.script`, leading to an `IndexError` in cases where there is only one element.

The failing test `test_not_match` expects the function to return `False` when the `stderr` of the `command` contains the usage message for `git stash`, but the script is just `'git'`, causing the function to raise an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is causing an `IndexError` because the script is just `'git'`, so splitting it based on spaces will result in a list with only one element. When trying to access the second element in this case, the `IndexError` occurs.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that before accessing the second element of the split script, we should check if there are more than one element in the split list. If not, we should return `False`.

## Correction
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if the length of `splited_script` is greater than `1` before accessing `splited_script[1]`, we ensure that there are enough elements in the `command.script` to avoid the `IndexError`.
