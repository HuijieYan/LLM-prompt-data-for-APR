## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the script part of the command is 'stash' and if the standard error message of the command contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the `split()` method is used on `command.script`, which leads to an `IndexError` if the command script has no second word.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with a script of 'git' and an error message containing the usage syntax for git stash.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes an `IndexError` due to the list index being out of range when trying to access the second element of the split command script.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script has fewer than two words by first checking the length of the split script.
5. The corrected version should consider this edge case and return `False` instead of raising an error.

## Correction
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the script first and then checking if it has more than one part, we ensure that when the script is just 'git' as in the failing test case, the function will return `False` without raising an `IndexError`. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and also satisfies the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
