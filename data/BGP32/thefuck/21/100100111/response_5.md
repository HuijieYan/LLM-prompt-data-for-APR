### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with `script` as `'git'` and `stderr` containing the string `'usage:'`.
3. The bug occurs because the function assumes there is a second word in `command.script`, leading to an `IndexError` when it tries to access the index `1` of the split string.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the `command.script` may not have enough words to access the second index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the split `command.script` has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second index.
2. Return `False` if the split `command.script` has less than 2 elements to prevent the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
        
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
