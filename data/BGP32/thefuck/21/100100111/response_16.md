## Analysis
1. The `match` function is intended to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the usage message is present in the stderr. 
2. The buggy function likely fails when the script is just 'git' and does not contain the expected patterns.
3. The bug is caused by the function trying to access index 1 of the split script without checking if it has enough elements, leading to an IndexError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the script has at least two elements before accessing index 1, which will prevent the IndexError.

## Correction
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected function will split the script first and then check if there are at least two elements before accessing index 1. This change will prevent the IndexError and allow the function to work correctly even when the script is just 'git'.

This correction should address the reported bug and ensure the function behaves as expected.
