## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is intended to return `True` if the command script's second word is 'stash' and the 'usage:' string is found in the command's stderr. However, the bug occurs because the function improperly assumes that the script will always consist of multiple words. In cases where the command has only one word, such as 'git', accessing the second element of the `split` operation on the script will result in an `IndexError`.

## Bug Location
The bug occurs within the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
when `command.script` has only one word.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, when `command.script` is 'git', the function attempts to split the script using `split()` and access the second element `[1]` of the resulting list. Since there is only one word in the script, trying to access the second element results in an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should first check the length of the split script to ensure that there are enough elements before attempting to access the second element. This check will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By modifying the function to first check if `splited_script` has a length greater than 1, we prevent the `IndexError` from happening. This correction ensures that the buggy function behaves correctly in cases where the command script is only one word long.
