## Analysis
- The buggy function `match` is a decorator `@git_support` function that checks if the given command is related to `git stash` and the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'.
- The failing test `test_not_match` expects the function `match` not to match a command that does not contain 'stash' but has a stderr containing 'usage:'.
- The expected input values for the failing test include a command with script 'git' and stderr containing the usage info for git stash.
- The bug occurs because the function tries to access the second element of the split script, assuming it exists.
- The GitHub issue reports an `IndexError` due to attempting to access an index that is out of range in the split script.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' exists in the script. We should also check if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and 'stash' in script_parts[1]:
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element and ensuring 'stash' is in the split script, we prevent the `IndexError` and correctly match the conditions.
