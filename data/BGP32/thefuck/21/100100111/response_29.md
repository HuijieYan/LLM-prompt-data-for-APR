## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the script's second word is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, it does not handle scenarios where the script contains only 'git' without any other words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Accessing element at index 1 in `split()` when the script has only one word.
2. Checking for 'stash' without verifying the length of the split script.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the script is just 'git', causing an `IndexError` because trying to access the second element of the split script (`command.script.split()[1]`) fails when there is only one element in the split. This leads to the mismatch between the expected input and the actual behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle cases where the script contains only one word ('git') separately so that we don't attempt to access a non-existent second element during the split operation.

## Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(splited_script) > 1
        and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- First, we split the script into a list of words.
- Then, we check if the length of the split script is more than 1 to ensure there is a second word.
- Finally, we verify if the second word is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. This way, we handle the case of a script with only 'git' before performing further comparisons.

This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` and address the issue reported on GitHub.
