## Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `script` of the `command` is `'stash'` and if the `stderr` of the `command` contains the string `'usage:'`. The failing test is checking if the function does not match when the `script` of the `command` is `'git'` and the `stderr` contains information related to `git stash`.

The expected behavior is that the function should not match when the script of the command is just `'git'` and the `stderr` contains information about `git stash`.

The GitHub issue details an index out of range error occurring because the function is trying to split a single-word script (in this case, `'git'`) without checking if there are multiple words in the script.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function assumes there will always be more than one word in the `script` of the `command`. When the `script` is just `'git'`, splitting it results in only one element in the list, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `script` contains multiple words before attempting to access the second word. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the `script` is a single word.


## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
