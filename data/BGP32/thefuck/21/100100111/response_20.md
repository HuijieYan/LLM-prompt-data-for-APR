## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is meant to check if the command script is "git stash" and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. The bug seems to be due to directly accessing the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.

The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to assert that the `match` function should return `False` when the command script is "git" and the stderr contains the usage information for the "git stash" command.

The expected input in this case is a command with script "git" and stderr containing the usage information for the "git stash" command.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when the script is just "git", resulting in an "IndexError: list index out of range" due to trying to access the second element of the split command script.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just "git".

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the script into a list and then checks if the length is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to compare with "stash".
