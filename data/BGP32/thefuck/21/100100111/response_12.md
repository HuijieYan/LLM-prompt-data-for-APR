## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, the bug seems to be related to the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is causing an `IndexError` in cases where `command.script` has only one word.

In the failing test case provided, the `Command` object is created with `script="git"` and `stderr` containing the Git stash error message. The buggy function fails to handle the case where `command.script` has only one word (`'git'` in this case), leading to an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will first check if the length of the splited script is at least 2 before accessing the element at index 1. If the length is less than 2, we will return False, indicating that the condition for matching is not met.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    if len(splited_script) < 2:  # Ensure at least 2 words in script
        return False
    
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first check if there are at least 2 words in `command.script`. If there are not, it will return `False`. Otherwise, it will proceed with the existing logic to check for the word `'stash'` in the second position and the string `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`. This fix should prevent the `IndexError` and ensure the function works as expected.
