## Analysis
The `match` function is supposed to identify if the command is related to a Git stash operation by checking if the script starts with "stash" and if the usage message is present in the stderr. The bug occurs when the script is just "git" without any additional parameters, causing an IndexError when trying to split the script by space.

## Bug Explanation
- When the script is just "git", splitting it by space results in a list with only one element `['git']`.
- The buggy function then tries to access the second element of the list (`[1]`), causing an IndexError because there is no second element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element. This way, we prevent the IndexError when the command script is minimal.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
