## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains `'stash'` as the second word and if the error output contains `'usage:'`.
2. The buggy function assumes that the command script has at least two words and raises an IndexError if the script has only one word.
3. The failing test case expects that the function should not match when the command script is just `'git'`.
4. The failing test case and the GitHub issue indicate that the function fails when the script contains only one word.

## Potential Error Location
The buggy function assumes that the command script can be split into two parts on whitespace, leading to the IndexError when there is only one part.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function tries to split the command script into parts assuming a specific structure (at least two parts) which is not always true. When the command script is just `'git'`, the split result has only one part, causing an IndexError when trying to access the second index.

## Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the split operation in the function does not raise an IndexError. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split result before trying to access the second index.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

With this fix, the code will first check if there are at least two parts after splitting the script before trying to access the second part, preventing the IndexError.
