## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is a decorator function used for git-related commands.
2. The function currently checks if the second split part of the command script is equal to 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr.
3. The failing test provides a Command object with script as 'git' and stderr containing usage information related to git stash.
4. The bug occurs when the `split()` operation is called on `command.script`, resulting in an IndexError if the script has only one part i.e., 'git'.
5. The GitHub issue describes the same bug where the script is just 'git' causing the list index to be out of range.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` assumes that the command.script will have multiple parts when split by space (' '). When a script like 'git' is provided, which has only one part, and the function tries to access the second index of the resulting list, it raises an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split command.script is greater than 1 before checking the second part. If the length is less than 2, the function should not proceed with the comparison.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this fix, the function will first check if the split command.script has at least 2 parts before attempting to access the second part for comparison. This modification will prevent the IndexError from occurring, and the function will work correctly for cases where the script has only one part like 'git'.
