## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The issue arises when the `command.script` is just 'git', causing an IndexError because the script is split into a list and then trying to access the second element.

## Identified Bug
The bug occurs due to attempting to access the second element of the split script when the script contains only one element. This leads to the IndexError.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function attempts to access the second element of the split command script without confirming the length of the split list. When the script contains only one element, it results in an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it means that the script does not contain the word 'stash', leading to a non-match.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script into a list `splited_script` and then check if the length of this list is at least 2. If it is, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This modification ensures that we prevent the IndexError when the script is just 'git', as it will fail the length check.
