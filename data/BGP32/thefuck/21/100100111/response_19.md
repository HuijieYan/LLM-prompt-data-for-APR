## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command entered is to work with stash in Git and if the usage information is present in the stderr.
2. The bug is likely occurring due to assuming that the `split` operation on the `command.script` will always have at least 2 elements.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to test the case when the command is simply 'git' and not related to stash. The buggy function fails in this case due to an IndexError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements obtained after splitting the script before accessing the second element. If not, we should return False.

## Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and check if there are more than 1 elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This prevents the IndexError from occurring in cases where the script may not contain multiple elements. This correction ensures that the function works correctly in all cases, including the failing test scenario.
