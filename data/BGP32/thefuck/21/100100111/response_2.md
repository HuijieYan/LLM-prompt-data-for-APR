## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word of the command's script is `'stash'` and if the `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with script as `'git'` and stderr containing the usage message for `git stash`.
3. Due to the condition `command.script.split()[1]`, it will raise an `IndexError` when the script has only one word (like in the failing test), leading to a failure.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the current implementation is due to assuming that the command script will always have at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing index 1 of the split result of the script. This assumption fails when the script has only one word, as in the failing test case.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script has at least two words before attempting to access index 1 of the split result. We can also verify if the first word of the script is `'git'` to ensure that we are dealing with a valid git command before proceeding with further checks.

## The Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    
    if len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[0] == 'git':
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    
    return False
``` 

The corrected version checks if the split script has at least two elements and if the first element is `'git'`. Only then it proceeds to check if the second element is `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function will not encounter an `IndexError` when accessing index 1 of the split script.
