### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the given `command` is related to a `git stash` operation based on the script and stderr message.
2. The function uses `split()[1]` on the script to check if the second word is "stash", which causes an `IndexError` if the script does not contain two words.
3. The failing test case provides a Command with script='git' and stderr containing the git stash command usage, triggering the bug.
4. The GitHub issue details an IndexError due to the list index out of range when checking the second word in the script.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes the `command.script` will have at least two words to split and access the second word. In the failing test, the script contains only one word 'git', causing the `IndexError` since there is no second index.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has the word 'stash' and then ensure it has more than one word before accessing the second word for comparison. This will prevent the IndexError when the script has fewer words.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By using `len(script_words) > 1` to ensure there are enough words in the script before trying to access the second word, we can fix the bug and prevent the IndexError.
