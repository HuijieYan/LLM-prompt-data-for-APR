## Analysis
The `match` function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, the function does not account for cases where the script does not have any additional elements after `'git'`.

The failing test is providing a script with only `'git'` and an error message related to the `git stash` command. The function fails due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function assumes there is always a second element after splitting the script. In this case, when the script is just `'git'`, the split results in a list with only one element. Trying to access the second element causes an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If there is only one element in the split script, we should return `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The updated version first checks if the `splited_script` has more than one element before accessing the second element. If there is only one element in `splited_script`, the function will return `False`, preventing the `IndexError`.
