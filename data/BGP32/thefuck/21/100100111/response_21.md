## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains `'stash'` as its second word and if the stderr contains `'usage:'`. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word or any subsequent words. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two words when splitting by whitespace. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is no second element after splitting, leading to the `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split script before comparing its elements.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected function first checks if the length of `splited_script` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. This modification ensures that the function will not encounter an `IndexError` when `command.script` does not have enough words.
