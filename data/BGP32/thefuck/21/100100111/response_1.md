## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. The test function is trying to match a command script of just 'git', which is causing an `IndexError` when it tries to access `split()[1]`.
2. The issue arises from assuming that the split command script will always have at least two elements.
3. The buggy function fails to handle cases where the command script has fewer than two elements, leading to an `IndexError`. The test case provides a command script of 'git' with an error message that contains 'usage:', expecting it not to match. However, due to the `IndexError`, it fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command script has more than one element before accessing the second element. We can perform a length check before accessing `split()[1]`.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fixed version of the function will check if the split script has more than one element before checking for 'stash'. This modification prevents the `IndexError` and corrects the functionality to match the expected behavior.
