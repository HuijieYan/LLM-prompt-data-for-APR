### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the split `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The failing test is trying to check the case when the script is just `'git'`, which results in an IndexError due to the split operation.

### Identify potential error locations
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after splitting.

### Explanation of the bug
1. **Input**: In the failing test, the input `command.script` is `'git'`, and the input `command.stderr` contains the usage information for git stash.

2. **Expected Output**: The current implementation of the `match` function tries to access `command.script.split()[1]` assuming there are at least two elements after the split, which is not true in the case of `command.script` being just `'git'`.

3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug is caused by the assumption that the split operation on `command.script` will always result in at least two elements. In this case, when the script is only `'git'`, accessing index `1` throws an IndexError.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation on `command.script` results in at least two elements before checking for the second element being `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if there are at least two elements after splitting `command.script`, we ensure that we avoid the IndexError and handle cases where the script might not contain enough elements after splitting. With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and prevent the IndexError.
