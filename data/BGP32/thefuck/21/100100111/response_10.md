## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a given command matches the pattern of a Git `stash` operation, indicated by the script containing "stash" and the usage message appearing in the stderr. However, in the failing test `test_not_match`, the `command` passed has a script that is just `'git'` without any mention of `stash`, causing the function to throw an `IndexError` due to trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Identification of potential error locations:
The error is occurring when attempting to split the script and access the second element without checking if it exists. This results in an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

## Explanation of the bug's cause:
The buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the command script. When the script is only `'git'`, accessing the second element results in an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains `"stash"` before trying to access the second element after splitting the script. This check will prevent the `IndexError` when the script lacks the required information.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the script contains more than one part before comparing it with `'stash'`. This modification covers cases where the script may not have enough elements to satisfy the comparison conditions, preventing any `IndexError`.
