### Analysis
The `match` function is checking if the second word of the command is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. The failing test is expecting the function not to match when the script is simply 'git' and the stderr contains the git stash usage information.

### Error Locations
1. The function assumes that `split()[1]` will always have a value, but it will throw an `IndexError` if the script is only 'git' without any additional words.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the command's script is just 'git', the split operation does not create a list with more than one element, causing the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to add a check to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding the check for the length of `splited_script`, we prevent the `IndexError` when accessing the second element of the list. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
