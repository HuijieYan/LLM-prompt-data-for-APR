The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' as the second word and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. However, the bug lies in the comparison of the script split by whitespace.

The issue arises because the buggy function splits the script by whitespace but only checks if the second element is 'stash'. This approach is not robust and can fail if there are additional spaces or if the script format changes.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to directly check if the script starts with 'git stash'. This approach will ensure that the function correctly identifies commands related to stashing and ignores extra spaces or format changes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will accurately determine if the command relates to 'git stash' based on the script without relying on whitespace splitting.
