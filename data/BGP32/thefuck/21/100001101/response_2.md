### Explanation
The current implementation of the `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`. However, the `split()` method may not correctly identify the second word as expected due to whitespace or other characters present in the `command.script`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should first split the `command.script` by whitespace to properly extract the second word. Then, we can check if the second word is `'stash'`. Additionally, we should check if the `command.stderr` contains the specific usage string related to stashing in Git.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` by whitespace and checking the second word for `'stash'`, we address the issue with correctly identifying the command. Additionally, by checking for the specific usage string related to stashing in Git in the `command.stderr`, we ensure a more robust matching process.
