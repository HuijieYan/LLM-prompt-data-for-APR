### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which is checking if the second element of the split `command.script` is equal to 'stash'. In the provided runtime values, `command.script` is only 'git' which doesn't have a second element after splitting. This causes an index out of range error and leads to the function not working as expected.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list contains 'stash' as one of its elements, rather than directly comparing the second element to 'stash'.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script.split()
``` 

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is present in the split elements of `command.script`, which will correctly identify if the command includes 'stash'.
