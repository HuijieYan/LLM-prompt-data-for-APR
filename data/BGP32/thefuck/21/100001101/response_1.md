## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where there are multiple words in the script. In the provided runtime values, the script is 'git' which results in the split script being ['git']. This causes the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` to fail, leading to the function not matching the command correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how we check for the presence of 'stash' in the script. Instead of directly checking the second word, we can check if 'stash' is present in the script split by spaces. This change will make the function more robust and capable of handling multiple words in the script.

## The corrected version of the function

def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
