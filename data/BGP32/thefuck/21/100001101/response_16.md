### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. However, the function is currently checking for an exact match of the second word 'stash' instead of checking if it is contained within the script. This will cause the function to fail for cases where 'stash' is in the script along with other words.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which only checks for an exact match, not if 'stash' is present within the script.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to check if 'stash' is in the list produced by splitting `command.script`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly identify cases where 'stash' is within the script, resolving the bug in the function.
