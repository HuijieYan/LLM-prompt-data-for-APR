### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the issue arises because the split function is being called on the entire `command.script`, not just the second word. This causes the condition to fail since 'git' is not equal to 'stash'.

### Bug
The bug is caused by splitting the entire `command.script` instead of just checking the second word.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then check if the second word is 'stash'. Also, we need to correct the check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()  # Split the script by whitespace
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
