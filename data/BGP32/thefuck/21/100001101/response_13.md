### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the condition to check the second word is incorrect as it should check the first word. Additionally, the function is splitting the entire `command.script` without taking into consideration the spaces, so it might not be correctly identifying the first word.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking the second word instead of the first word in the `command.script`, and not splitting the `command.script` properly.

### Fix Strategy
1. Split the `command.script` using spaces and take the first word to compare with `'stash'`.
2. Check if the first word is `'stash'`.
3. Check if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.strip().split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
