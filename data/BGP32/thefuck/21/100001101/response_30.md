### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the comparison is not accurate as it splits the script by spaces and directly compares the second word. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the command script has additional whitespace or if the 'stash' word is not exactly in the second position.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by directly comparing the split script to 'stash', assuming it is in the second position, which may not always be the case.

### Bug Fix
We should check if 'stash' is in the split script instead of comparing it directly. Additionally, we should check if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.strip().split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
