The issue with the current implementation is that it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the script provided in the test case has 'stash' as the first word, not the second. This mismatch is causing the function to return False when it should return True.

To fix this bug, we should modify the script.split()[1] to script.split()[0] to check the first word in the command script.

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this modification, the function should now correctly identify the command script as starting with 'git' and contain 'usage:' in the stderr, returning True as expected.
