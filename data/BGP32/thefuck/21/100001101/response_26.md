### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second part of the command's script is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. Based on the provided runtime and expected values, the buggy function should actually check if `'stash'` is present in the script and if `'usage:'` is present in the stderr.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it is incorrectly checking the split command's script parts.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the word `'stash'` is present in the script and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version of the function checks for the presence of `'stash'` in the script and `'usage:'` in the stderr, matching the expected behavior.
