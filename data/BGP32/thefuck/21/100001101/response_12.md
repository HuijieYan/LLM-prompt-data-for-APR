The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, based on the provided runtime and expected values, it seems like the condition to check for the second word `'stash'` is not necessary.

The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the check for the second word `'stash'` and only focus on checking if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now correctly identify the presence of `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr` as the criteria for a match without considering the second word in the `command.script`.
