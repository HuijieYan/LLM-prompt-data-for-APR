### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to match a specific condition based on the input command. In this case, it is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The bug seems to be in the condition checking part of the function.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function is splitting the `command.script` using whitespaces and checking the second element. However, in the provided runtime input values, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, with no second element to check. This leads to an index out of range error and prevents the function from matching correctly.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can modify the condition to include this check before proceeding with the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
``` 

By adding the check `if len(splited_script) >= 2:`, we ensure that the function only proceeds with the comparison if there are enough words in `command.script`. This will prevent the index out of range error and correctly match the desired conditions.
