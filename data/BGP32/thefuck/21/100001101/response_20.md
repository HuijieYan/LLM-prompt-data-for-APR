The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. Based on the provided runtime values and expected values, the buggy function is expected to return True, as the command.script.split()[1] is 'stash' and 'usage:' is found in command.stderr. However, the function is not correctly identifying these conditions.

The issue lies in the comparison of the script split. Instead of checking if the second word is 'stash', it should directly compare the script with 'git stash'. Additionally, the 'usage:' check should be case-insensitive to match the provided values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower())
```

This correction will accurately check if the command script contains 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is present in a case-insensitive manner in the command's stderr.
