The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, based on the provided input and expected values, the command script is just 'git' and there is no 'stash' in it, causing the function to return False incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should first split the command script and check if 'stash' is in the split script, and then check if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This way, we are correctly checking if 'stash' is present in the command script parts before the 'usage:' in the stderr to determine a match. This change should now correctly identify the match based on the input and expected values provided.
