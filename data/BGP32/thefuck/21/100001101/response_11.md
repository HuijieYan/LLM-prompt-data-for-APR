The bug in the provided function is that it splits the command script by spaces and checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, in the provided case, the script only consists of 'git' and there is no 'stash' keyword, leading to a false positive match.

To fix this bug, we need to check if 'stash' is present in the command script itself, rather than just relying on the split elements.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version checks if 'stash' is present in the command.script directly, which aligns with the expected behavior when checking for git stash related commands.
