### Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the condition is not correctly checking for the entire word `'stash'` in the `command.script`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` only checks if the second element in the split list is `'stash'`, which may not be accurate if `command.script` contains more than one word. 

### Fix:
We need to check if `'stash'` is in the list of words obtained from splitting `command.script` rather than just comparing the second element.

### The corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
