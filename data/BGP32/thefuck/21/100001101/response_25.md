### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is checking if the second word in the script is 'stash' instead of the first word. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug
The bug is caused by splitting the script using `command.script.split()[1]`, which only considers the second word in the script instead of the first word.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the split operation to consider the first word in the script.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function checks if the first word in the script is 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.
