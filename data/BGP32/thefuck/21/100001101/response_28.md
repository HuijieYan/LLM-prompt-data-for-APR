### Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. However, the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might lead to an IndexError if the command script does not have a second word. 

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the `command.script` will always have a word at the second position when split, causing an IndexError when this assumption is not met.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting `command.script` before checking the second word, we prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the conditions are checked correctly.
