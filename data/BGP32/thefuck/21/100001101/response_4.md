The bug in the provided function is that it is checking if the second element in the split script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the second element is 'git' and not 'stash' in the provided script. This is causing the function to incorrectly return False even though the expected behavior should be True.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the first element in the split script is 'git' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the first element instead of the second one, the function will now correctly identify commands where the script starts with 'git' and 'usage:' is present in the stderr.
