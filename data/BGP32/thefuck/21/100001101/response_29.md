The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage:'. However, the bug lies in the comparison condition using `split()[1]`, which only accounts for a single word in the script. This causes the comparison to fail when there are more words in the script.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if 'stash' is present in the list obtained by splitting `command.script` instead of directly comparing with `split()[1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will correctly check if 'stash' exists in the script regardless of its position within the words.
