## Bug Explanation

The buggy function is checking if the second element of the split command script is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The bug arises because the split command script does not contain 'stash' in the provided test case, causing the function to return False incorrectly.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to check if the split command script contains 'stash' anywhere rather than just at the second element. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the command as related to stash operations.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
