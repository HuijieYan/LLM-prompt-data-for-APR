### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, the comparison is incorrect because the `command.script` is split by spaces and compared to `'stash'`, which will not match the whole word `'stash'`. Additionally, the check for `'usage:' in command.stderr` is not correct because the value of `command.stderr` includes more than just the line containing `'usage:'`.

### Bug Cause
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is incorrect because the whole word should be compared instead of individual parts.
2. The check `'usage:' in command.stderr` is incorrect because it checks for the substring `'usage:'` within the entire `command.stderr`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison to check the whole word `'stash'` in `command.script`.
2. Check for the presence of the exact string `'usage: git stash'` in `command.stderr` to accurately identify the case.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version of the function compares the whole word 'stash' in `command.script` and checks for the presence of the exact string 'usage: git stash' in `command.stderr`.
