### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the condition is not correctly checking the split script since it only considers the second word without checking if there are any words after it.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` not properly handling cases where there are no words after 'stash' in the script.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split script has at least two elements to avoid index out of range errors. We can then check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
