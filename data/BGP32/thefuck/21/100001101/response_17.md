The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. It seems like the bug lies in splitting the script and checking the second word, which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is splitting the command script incorrectly and checking for the second word instead of 'git stash'. This results in the incorrect comparison and the function not behaving as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to split the script correctly and check if the first two words are 'git stash' instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0:2] == ['git', 'stash']
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
