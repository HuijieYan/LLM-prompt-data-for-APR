### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr has the word 'usage:'. However, the current implementation splits the command script and only checks the second element, which is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is splitting the command script incorrectly and only checking the second element. This causes the comparison to fail even when the command script contains 'stash' and the stderr includes 'usage:'.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to split the script correctly and check if 'stash' is present in any part of the script. Additionally, we need to check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting the script correctly and checking for 'stash' in any part of the script, we ensure that the function behaves as intended. Additionally, by checking for 'usage:' in the stderr, we cover the other condition that needs to be met.
