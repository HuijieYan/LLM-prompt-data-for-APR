The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, the issue is that the function is splitting `command.script` by whitespace without considering multiple spaces between words which can lead to an incorrect comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `command.script` correctly and check for the word 'stash' in the split list instead of directly splitting on whitespace.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version splits `command.script` into a list of words properly and then checks if 'stash' is in that list. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate and the function will behave correctly with the given inputs and outputs.
