### Analysis
The current implementation of the `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where additional words are present after `'stash'` in the `command.script`.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it only checks the second word in the `command.script` for equality with `'stash'`. If there are additional words after `'stash'`, the condition will fail, even if the command is related to stash.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should split the `command.script` and check if `'stash'` is present in any part of the split command. This way, we can handle cases where additional words occur after `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting the `command.script` and checking if `'stash'` is present in any part of the split command, we can accurately identify commands related to stash, regardless of additional words after `'stash'`. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
