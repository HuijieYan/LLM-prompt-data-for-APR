## Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element in the split script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, in the provided case, the split script is `['git']` and not `['git', 'stash']`, causing the buggy function to return False even though the expected values are satisfied.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains both 'git' and 'stash' in consecutive positions. We can achieve this by checking if 'stash' is present in the split script and the index of 'stash' is 1 (indicating it is the second element in the split script).

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return 'stash' in splited_script and splited_script.index('stash') == 1 and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
