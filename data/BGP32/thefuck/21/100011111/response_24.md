The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` can always be split into multiple parts without checking the length of the split result. In this specific case, when `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting it results in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If not, we can safely assume that the condition for the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function will not throw an `IndexError` in cases where there are not enough arguments in `command.script`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
