### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` because the `split()` function is being called without checking if `command.script` actually contains multiple words.
3. The `command.script` provided has only one word `'git'`, causing the `split()` function to fail and result in the `IndexError`.
4. To fix this, we need to first check if `command.script` contains more than one word before trying to split it.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split command script only if it contains more than one word
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False  # Return False if script does not contain enough words
```

This fix ensures that the `split()` function is only called when `command.script` contains multiple words, preventing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.
