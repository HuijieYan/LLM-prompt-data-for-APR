### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The error occurs when the script is just 'git', and the function tries to access the second element of the split result, causing an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug happens because the function blindly assumes that there will always be a second element in the split result of the script. However, when the script is just 'git', there is only one element after splitting. This leads to the Index Error when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second one. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function will not throw an IndexError, even when the script is just 'git'. This correction will address the bug and prevent the failing test from raising an error.
