### Analysis
1. The buggy function checks if the second element in the split `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` pointing to the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This error occurs because `command.script.split()` results in a list with only one element.
3. The expected input and output values show that `command.script` is `'git'`, leading to a single element list after splitting, causing the IndexError.
4. To fix the bug, we can first check if the split command has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If not, we return False.
5. The corrected version is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
