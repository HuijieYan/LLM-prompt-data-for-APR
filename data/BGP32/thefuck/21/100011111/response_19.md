The bug in the current buggy function is caused by the assumption that the input command will always have more than one word in the script attribute. When the script attribute has only one word (like 'git' in this case), splitting it based on whitespace would result in a single-element list, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1.
2. Update the condition to check if the first element in the split script list is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By making these adjustments, the function will correctly handle cases where the script attribute consists of only one word, avoiding the IndexError and passing the failing test.
