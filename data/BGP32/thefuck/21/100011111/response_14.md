### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element in the space-separated `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`. If this condition is met and the string `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`, the function returns `True`. However, the bug is due to the assumption that `command.script` will always have more than one element when split. In the failing test scenario, `command.script` is just `'git'`, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access an element at index 1 after splitting.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` splits into multiple elements before trying to access the second element to avoid `IndexError`. Additionally, we should also validate the presence of `'stash'` element in the split `command.script` before further processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should now properly handle cases where `command.script` may have insufficient elements after splitting.
