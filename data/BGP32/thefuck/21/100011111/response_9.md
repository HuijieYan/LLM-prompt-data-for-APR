The buggy function is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` because it is trying to access the second element of the list obtained from splitting the `command.script` string, even though there might not be a second element. To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split command actually contains more than one element before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the condition `len(split_script) > 1`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the second element of the split script list if it actually exists. This fix will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script is just `'git'`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
