## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is currently splitting the `command.script` by whitespaces and checking the second element to be `'stash'`. The issue arises when there is no second element due to only having `'git'` in the `command.script`, causing an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` does not contain the expected keyword `'stash'`. We can check the length of the split array before accessing its elements to prevent the `IndexError`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before trying to access the element at index 1, we prevent the `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the expected input/output values.
