The bug in the provided function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements when splitting it and trying to access the second element directly. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, we can return `False` to indicate that the command doesn't match the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function checks the length of the split script before accessing the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
