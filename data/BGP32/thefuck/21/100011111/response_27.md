### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the word `'usage:'`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 8 in the `match` function.
3. The function is splitting `command.script` by whitespace and trying to access the second element, which causes an error if the script doesn't contain multiple words.
4. The bug occurs because the function assumes that there will always be at least two words in `command.script`, which is not the case when the script is just `'git'`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script` has more than one word before attempting to access the second word.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Add a condition to check if there are enough words in `command.script` before accessing the second word.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

### Justification:
By adding the conditional check `if len(command.script.split()) > 1` before trying to access the second word, we ensure that the function doesn't throw an `IndexError` when the script is short. The `return False` at the end covers the case when there are not enough words in the script for the condition to be met.
