## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list. The bug occurs when the script is only `'git'` without any other arguments, resulting in a single-element list after splitting. This triggers the `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split script list before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. We should also ensure that the command is related to the `git stash` operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the script and then checks if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

By applying this fix, the function should now handle the case where the script is only `'git'` and avoid the issue reported in GitHub.
