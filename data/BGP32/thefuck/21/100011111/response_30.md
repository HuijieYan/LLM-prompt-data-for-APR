## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` using a space and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in an `IndexError` since there is only one element after splitting.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check the length of the splitted list before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. We can also add a check to ensure that the condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` is satisfied.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

By implementing this corrected version of the function, it will address the issue of the function trying to access an index that is out of range, resulting in a successful match for the test case where the script is just 'git'.
