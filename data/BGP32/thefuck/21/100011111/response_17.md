### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` indicating that the list index is out of range in the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the code.
3. The input `command.script` is `'git'` which results in `split()` creating a list `['git']` and trying to access the element at index 1, leading to the `IndexError`.
4. To fix this, we need to check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing index 1.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of `splited_script`, we ensure that we do not attempt to access an index that is out of range, preventing the `IndexError`.
