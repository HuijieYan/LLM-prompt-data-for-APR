### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` when attempting to access index 1 in a list where there might not be enough elements.
3. The function fails for the provided input because the script does not contain multiple words separated by spaces, causing the split()[1] to raise an IndexError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script split into multiple words before trying to access index 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to check if the script contains multiple words before attempting to access index 1.
2. Update the `match` function to handle cases where only one word is present in the script.
3. By incorporating a check for the length of the split script, we can avoid the IndexError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
``` 

By incorporating the check for the length of `split_script` before accessing index 1, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring, thereby fixing the bug.
