## Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` because the split list of the script might not have the required number of elements to access the second element.
- The expected input/output values and the failing test case also point towards the `IndexError` due to the split function.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the rule fails when the script is just 'git', triggering an `IndexError` in the same way.

## Bug Location
- The bug is located in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where the split list might not have enough elements for the index access.

## Bug Cause
- The bug is caused due to assuming that the split operation on the command script will always produce a list with at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.
- It's also important to check if the command script is not just 'git' to match the behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError`. Additionally, the correction ensures that the script is not just 'git' to match the behavior discussed in the GitHub issue.
