### Analysis:
1. The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurred when trying to access the second element after splitting `command.script`.
3. The expected behavior is to split the script correctly and then check the condition.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the rule fails when the script is just "git".
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when the `command.script` only contains "git", and splitting it into words results in a list with only one element. Attempting to access the second element causes the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the script contains more than one word before attempting to access the second word.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if the `splitted_script` list has more than one element to avoid the `IndexError`. Then we proceed to check the other conditions for matching.
