## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `match` function is called with a `Command` object where the `script` attribute only contains the string `'git'`. The current implementation attempts to split the `script` attribute by spaces and access the second element, which leads to an `IndexError` since there is only one element in the list after splitting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result is long enough before accessing the second element. If the length is greater than or equal to 2, then we can safely check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script by spaces
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    # Check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By adding the additional check for the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where the `script` attribute is only `'git'` and pass the failing test.
