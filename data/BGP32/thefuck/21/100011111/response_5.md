### Analysis:
- The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.
- The error message indicates an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting the command script.
- The runtime values show that the command script is just `'git'`, so the attempt to split it and access the second element causes the IndexError.
- The expected behavior should be that when the command script does not contain 'stash', the function should return False.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that the command script can always be split and accessed at index 1 without checking its length. When the script is just 'git', splitting it and trying to access index 1 leads to an IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
- Before accessing index 1, check if the split of the command script has at least two elements. If not, return False.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
