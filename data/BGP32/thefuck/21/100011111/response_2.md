## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` doesn't contain enough words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word. This is the root cause of the problem.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that before accessing the second word in `command.script`, there are actually enough words available in it. We can perform a check to verify the length of the split script before accessing index 1.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script by whitespace
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the script contains at least two words and if the second word is 'stash'
    return len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we ensure that the function will not raise an `IndexError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
