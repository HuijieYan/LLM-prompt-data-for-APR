### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by `command.script.split()[1]`.
3. The function is expecting the second word in the script which is `stash` in this case, but for `git` script, it fails because there is no second word.
4. A strategy to fix this bug is to first check if the split contains more than one element before accessing the second element. If not, return False.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` when the script doesn't contain a second word. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
