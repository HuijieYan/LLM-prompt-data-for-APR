## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is only "git", leading to an `IndexError`.
2. The function is assuming that there will always be at least two words in the script, causing the IndexError.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two words in the command script but fails when the script has only one word, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` when the script has only one word.
