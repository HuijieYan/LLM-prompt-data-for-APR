The buggy function is failing with an IndexError when trying to split the command.script. The function is checking if the second element of the split script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr. 

The issue is that when the script is just 'git', splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element. This leads to the function failing for commands where the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it means there is no 'stash' command in the script, so we can return False immediately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of the split script is at least 2 before proceeding to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it immediately returns False, preventing the IndexError.
