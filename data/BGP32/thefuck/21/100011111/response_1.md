### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which means that the `command.script` does not have a second word to split.
3. The provided runtime values show that `command.script` is just `'git'` which does not have a second word to split, causing the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` does not have enough words to split.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Justification:
- I added a check to ensure that the `splited_script` has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.
- This modification will prevent the `IndexError` when `command.script` does not have enough words to split.
- The corrected version should now handle cases where the `command.script` may not have sufficient words to split.
