### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expecting the second word of the `command.script` to be `'stash'` and at the same time, it checks for the presence of the string `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr`. However, the failing test showcases that the `command.script` is just `'git'`, leading to an `IndexError` as there is no second word to split. This indicates that the function is not handling cases where the `command.script` does not have enough words.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes the presence of the second word in `command.script` without validating its length, leading to an `IndexError` when the script has only one word.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` has enough words before trying to access the second word. We can do this by splitting the script's words and then validating if there are enough words to proceed with the comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function first splits the `command.script` and then checks whether there are more than one word before comparing the second word. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the `command.script` has only one word.
