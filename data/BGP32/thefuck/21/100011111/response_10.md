### Analyzing the buggy function
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
- The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` occurring at `command.script.split()[1]`, implying that `split()` is not finding any elements to split.
- The runtime values show that the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which means there is no second word to split.
- The expected values confirm that the input script should be `'git'`, and splitting this will only result in `['git']`.

### Fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` has no elements to split. We can do this by checking the length of the split list before accessing the second element. If the split list has at least 2 elements, we can proceed with the comparison.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
