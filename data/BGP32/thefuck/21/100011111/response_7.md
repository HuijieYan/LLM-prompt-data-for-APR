## Bug Fix

### Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element after splitting the `command.script` by spaces. However, in some cases, the `command.script` may not contain any spaces after being split, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. Additionally, we should also consider the case where the split script has only one element (no spaces to split).

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the split script, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure accurate matching for the conditions specified in the function.
