### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `'usage:'` keyword is present in the `command.stderr`.
- The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs when attempting to split the `command.script` into a list and accessing the second index when the list has fewer elements.
- Based on the runtime values and types, in this case, the `command.script` is `'git'`, which does not have a second word for splitting.
- The expected behavior is to handle cases where `command.script` might not have multiple words to split.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to:
- Check if the length of the split `command.script` list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.
- Return `False` if the length is insufficient to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the `splited_script` list in the corrected version, we ensure that the index does not go out of range and avoid the `IndexError`.
