### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the input command is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the stderr of the command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which occurs when trying to access an index of a list that does not exist.

The failing test provides the `command` with script `'git'` and stderr with a message containing `'usage:'`.

### Identifying the bug

The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the second element of the split command script, which has only one element ('git'). This causes an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the split command script.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we check the length of the split command script before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the split command script has more than one element before trying to access index 1. If it does not, it returns False, indicating that the conditions are not satisfied. This fix should resolve the `IndexError` and ensure the function works correctly with the provided test case.
