### Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the `split()` function is trying to access an index that does not exist.
- The expected behavior is to check the second word in the script only if it exists.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word, causing the `split()` function to raise an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `split()` operation has generated at least two items before accessing the second word.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `splited_script` before accessing the second index, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This correction ensures that the function works as expected without raising any errors for different command inputs.
