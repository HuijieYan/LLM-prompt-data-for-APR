## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is checking if the second word in the script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The bug is causing an `IndexError` because the split operation on the `command.script` may result in an empty list if there are no words in the script. This is leading to the `list index out of range` error.

## Error Location
The potential error location is in the `command.script.split()[1]` where it tries to access the second element of the split script without checking if the split array actually contains an element at that index.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `split()` operation does not handle cases where the script is empty or does not contain multiple words. When the script is just 'git', for example, splitting it by whitespace does not result in enough elements to access the second index. This causes the `IndexError`.

## Suggested Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has enough elements before trying to access the second index. We can also refine the condition by checking if the error message contains 'git' as well to make the rule more specific.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr
            and 'git' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we store the split script words in `script_words` and then check if it has more than one element before accessing the second index. Additionally, we add a condition to check if 'git' is present in the command's stderr to make the rule more specific.
