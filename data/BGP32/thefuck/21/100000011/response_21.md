### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to match if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the usage message is present in the stderr. The bug occurs when the command script has only one word, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split command script.

### Error Locations:
The potential error location is when trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script will always have at least two elements when split. If the command script has only one word (e.g., 'git'), trying to access the second element will result in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to check if there are at least two elements before trying to access the second element in the split command script to prevent the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.strip().split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script and checks if there are at least two parts before trying to access the second part. It resolves the `IndexError` by ensuring that the index is within bounds before accessing it.
