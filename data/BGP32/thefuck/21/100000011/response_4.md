### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to match a git command that has 'stash' as the second argument and 'usage:' in the stderr. However, the issue reported on GitHub highlights that when executing just `git` without any arguments, it results in a `list index out of range` error due to split()[1] accessing an index that does not exist.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that there will always be at least two elements in the split() result of `command.script`. When executing `git` command without arguments, the split() function only produces a list with one element, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split() result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, we should return False to avoid the IndexError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    cmd_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(cmd_parts) > 1 and cmd_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
