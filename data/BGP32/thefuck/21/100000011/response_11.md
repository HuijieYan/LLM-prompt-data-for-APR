## Analysis:
The function `match` is intended to check if the git command involves stashing changes by looking for the keyword "stash" in the command and checking if the string "usage:" is present in the stderr of the command output. However, the bug occurs when the command script does not contain any arguments and is only 'git'. In such a case, splitting the command script results in an empty list causing an `IndexError`.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug happens because the split operation on an empty command script results in an empty list, and trying to access the index 1 of an empty list causes the `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that there is at least one element in the split command script before accessing index 1.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

In the corrected version, the `split` operation is stored in a variable `script_parts`, and then a check is added to ensure that there are at least 2 elements in `script_parts` before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This modification prevents the `IndexError` by making sure that the index exists before accessing it.
