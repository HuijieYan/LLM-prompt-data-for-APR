### Analysis:
The buggy function `match(command)` is designed to check if the `git stash` command was run and if there is a specific error message in the output. However, the bug occurs when the `git` command is run with no arguments, resulting in an `IndexError` because `split()` method is trying to access index 1 which does not exist.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `split()` method might not be working as intended.
2. Unclear validation for the presence of the 'stash' keyword in the command script.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `split()[1]` will always exist in the script, leading to an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git' with no additional arguments.

### Fix Strategy:
We can fix this bug by validating the length of the split list before accessing index 1. Additionally, we can improve the check for the 'stash' keyword in the command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the command script into parts and then check if the length is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1. This prevents the `IndexError` when there are no additional arguments. Then we verify if the second part is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the stderr to match the conditions needed to fix the stash rule.
