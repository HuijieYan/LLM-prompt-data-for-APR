## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command entered by the user is related to `git stash`. However, the current implementation is checking if the second word in the command is `'stash'`, which can lead to an `IndexError` if there are not enough words after splitting the command.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the current function is the `command.script.split()[1]` part. This assumes that there is always a second word in the split command, which may not be the case.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused when the command entered is just `'git'`, which does not have a second word after splitting. This leads to an `IndexError`, as seen in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should check if the split command has enough words before accessing the second word. If there are not enough words, then the function should return `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and then check if there are enough words. If there are, we proceed with the check for `'stash'` and `'usage:'`. Otherwise, we return `False` immediately. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.
