### Analysis:
The buggy function is a `match` function for a specific `git` command in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function checks if the script argument contains the word 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. The bug seems to occur due to accessing an index that is out of range, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is at `command.script.split()[1]` when splitting the script by whitespace and trying to access the 2nd element directly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the script might not contain a second element after splitting, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the 2nd element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` and then checks if there are at least two elements in the resulting list before accessing the 2nd element.
