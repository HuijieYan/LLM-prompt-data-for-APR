### Analysis:
The buggy function defined in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is supposed to match the command when the script contains `git stash` and the string `usage:` is present in the command's stderr. However, based on the error message from the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when the script is just `git` without any further arguments, causing an `IndexError` due to accessing an index that does not exist.

### Error Locations:
1. The buggy line is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. 
   - This line assumes that splitting the script by space will always have a second element available, causing an IndexError when the script is just `git` without any additional arguments.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function is assuming the presence of a second element after splitting the script, leading to an IndexError when the script is just `git` without any additional arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the script does not contain any arguments after splitting. We should first check if the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we store the result of splitting the script into parts in a variable `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element to prevent the IndexError.
