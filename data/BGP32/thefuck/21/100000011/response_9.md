## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. This function is causing an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git' because `command.script.split()` does not have at least two elements in it.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location causing the bug is the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. 

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function's logic expects a second word in the command script when the script is 'git'. However, in this scenario, there is only one word in the command script ('git'), leading to the `IndexError` due to trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the split command script.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first handle the case where the command script doesn't have enough words to split into multiple elements. One way to do this is by checking the length of the split command script before accessing specific indexes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script into elements and then check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element of the split script. This approach will prevent the `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'.
