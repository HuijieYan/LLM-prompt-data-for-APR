### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the case where the `command.script` is just `'git'`, the `split()` operation will only contain one element, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line where it tries to access index 1 of the split result: `command.script.split()[1]`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is causing the `IndexError` because the `command.script.split()` does not contain a second element when the script is just `'git'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split result before comparing elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

### Bug Fix Explanation:
In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 (i.e., it has at least 2 elements) before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This prevents the `IndexError` when there are not enough elements in the split result.
