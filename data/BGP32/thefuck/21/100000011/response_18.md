### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. The issue reported on GitHub states that the error occurs when the script provided is just `git` without any arguments, leading to an `IndexError` because there is no second word in the script to check.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not account for the case when the script does not have a second word, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the function to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access index 1, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Splitting the script into words and checking if it has at least 2 elements
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version of the function first checks if the number of words in the script is at least 2 before trying to access index 1, thereby preventing the `IndexError` when handling the command where only `git` is provided.
