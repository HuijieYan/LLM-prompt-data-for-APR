### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine if the command is related to `git stash` by checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. The bug is causing an `IndexError` because it directly tries to access the second element of the list returned by `split()` without checking if the list has at least two elements.

### Potential Error Locations:
The buggy line is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. The `IndexError` occurs if the split result does not have at least two elements.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second element in the list returned by `split()`, which is not always true. The provided script in the GitHub issue only contains 'git' word and not 'stash', leading to the IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the list after splitting the command script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. We can also check if the word 'stash' is present to match with the git stash command.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) >= 2 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and store it in a variable `split_command`. Then, we check if the length of `split_command` is at least 2 before accessing the second element. This ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` and also check for the presence of 'stash'.
