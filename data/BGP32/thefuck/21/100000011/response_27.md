### Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. However, the provided GitHub issue indicates that the function fails when the script is just 'git', which results in a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is happening because the script.split() method is being called without first checking if there are words to split. This causes the list index out of range error when there are no words to split.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes there will always be at least two words in the script, but when the script is just 'git', there is only one word, leading to the IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we first split the script into words and then check if there are at least two words before comparing the second word to 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring when the script is just 'git'.
