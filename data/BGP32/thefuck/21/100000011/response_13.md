## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` aims to match if the `git stash` command was incorrectly entered based on the `stderr` of the `command`. The buggy function checks if the second word in the `script` of the `command` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the `stderr`.

## Potential error locations:
The buggy function might raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `split()`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the error `IndexError: list index out of range` occurred when using the `git` command alone. This issue arises because when the command `git` is entered without any arguments, the `split()` function doesn't return a list with enough elements, causing the index to go out of range.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `script` does not have enough words to extract the second word.

## Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the `script` into words and then checks if there are more than one word before checking if the second word is 'stash'. This change ensures that the index access won't go out of range when the `git` command is used alone.
