## Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second part of the input command (split by space) is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the error output. The bug arises in cases where the command is just 'git' without any additional parameters. This causes an 'IndexError' because splitting the input command and trying to access the second element when there is none raises this error.

## Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where the script is split by space and the second element is being accessed without checking if it exists.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second element in the split script. When the command is just 'git', there is no second element, resulting in an 'IndexError'.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if there are enough elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. We should also ensure that the command is 'stash' specifically and not just any second element.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script and store the parts in a variable. Then, we check if there are more than one element (`len(parts) > 1`), and if the second element is 'stash'. This prevents the 'IndexError' when the command is just 'git'.
