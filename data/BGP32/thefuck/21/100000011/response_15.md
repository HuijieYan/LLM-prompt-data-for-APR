## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` based on the presence of the word "stash" in the script and the word "usage:" in the standard error. However, the bug occurs when the script only contains "git" and does not have any additional arguments, resulting in a `IndexError` due to trying to access index 1 of the split script.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` when there are no additional arguments after 'git' in the script.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused when the script only contains "git", without any further arguments. This triggers the IndexError when attempting to access index 1 of the split script, which leads to the rule failing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split script contains more than one element before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError when the script only contains "git".

## The Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split script before trying to access index 1, we ensure that the rule does not encounter an IndexError when only "git" is present in the script.
