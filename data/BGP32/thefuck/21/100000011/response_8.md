## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash based on the input script and stderr. However, the issue description reveals that the bug occurs when the script is just "git" with no additional arguments. This causes an IndexError due to trying to split a script that does not have multiple parts.

## Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the command.script will always have multiple parts to split. In the case of just "git" command without any arguments, this assumption leads to an IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two parts before comparing the second part to 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError when the script has only one part.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the script into its individual parts and then check if there are at least two parts before comparing the second part to 'stash'. This modification ensures that the IndexError is avoided when the script has only a single part like "git".
