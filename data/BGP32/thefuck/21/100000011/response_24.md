## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element in the list generated by splitting the command's script is equal to `'stash'`. This is done to determine if the command is related to `git stash`. However, the bug occurs when the command is simply `git` without any arguments, resulting in an `IndexError`.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` when the `split()` function is called on `command.script` without checking if there are elements after splitting.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that there is always a second element after splitting the script, which is not true when the script is just `git` without any arguments. This assumption leads to the `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are elements after splitting the script before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should also check if the command is simply `git` and handle it accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    if len(script_split) > 1:
        return (script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
``` 

In the corrected version above:
- We first split the script and store it in a variable `script_split`.
- We then check if the length of `script_split` is greater than 1, ensuring that there is at least a second element.
- If there are elements after splitting, we proceed with checking if the second element is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr.
- If there are no elements after splitting (i.e., the command is simply `git`), we return `False` to avoid the IndexError.
