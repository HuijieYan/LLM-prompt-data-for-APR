## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to match the command where the second word is 'stash' and the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'. The bug occurs when the script contains only 'git' without any additional arguments after it. This triggers an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting the script. However, when the script is just 'git', there is only one element in the list after splitting, causing the `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the script has at least two elements after splitting before accessing the second element. We need to check the length of the split script before accessing any specific element.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access its elements, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. Now, the function will correctly match the command even when the script is just 'git'.
