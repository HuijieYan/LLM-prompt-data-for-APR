### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. However, the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue indicates that when the script is 'git', the function fails with an `IndexError` as the script doesn't contain the second word.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error occurs at the line `command.script.split()[1]` when the script doesn't contain a second word, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function assumes that there will always be a second word in the script, causing an `IndexError` when it doesn't find one. This issue arises specifically when the script is only 'git'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script doesn't contain the second word. We should first check if there are enough words in the script before accessing the second word to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the script into words and then check if there are more than one word before comparing the second word with 'stash'. This modification avoids the `IndexError` when the script doesn't contain multiple words.
