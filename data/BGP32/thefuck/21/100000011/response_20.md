## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is designed to check if a Git command involves stashing using the `git stash` command. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script.split()` results in an empty list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element `[1]`.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Accessing the second element `[1]` of the split list without checking if the list is empty.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes the presence of at least two elements in the split list generated from `command.script`. When the command is just `git`, the split list is empty, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list is not empty before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we will need to adjust the condition to check if 'stash' is in the command instead of directly comparing the second element to 'stash'.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and 'stash' in command.script)
```

By checking if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element, we avoid the IndexError. Also, by checking if 'stash' is in the command, we ensure we detect the correct Git command involving stashing.
