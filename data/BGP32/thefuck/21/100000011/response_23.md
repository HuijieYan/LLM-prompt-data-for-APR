### Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if a command is related to `git stash` based on the presence of the word 'stash' in the command script and the existence of 'usage:' in the stderr output. However, the bug occurs when the script contains only 'git', causing a list index out of range error when attempting to access the second element of the split script.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `command.script.split()[1]` where the index is hardcoded to access the second element of the split script.
- The condition checking for 'stash' in the command script without verifying the length of the split script.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the script will always contain more than one element after splitting. When the script is only 'git', the attempt to access index 1 results in an IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the split script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. Additionally, we should check if the script includes 'stash' and if 'usage:' exists in the stderr output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access index `1`, we prevent the IndexError. This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the rule fails when the script is just 'git'.
