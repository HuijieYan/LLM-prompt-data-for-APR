### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script is related to a Git stash operation, and if the error message 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command. However, the current implementation is causing an `IndexError` when attempting to split the script by space and access the second element `[1]` without proper validation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Splitting the command script without checking if it has enough elements.
2. Accessing the second element without verifying the presence of the first element.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command script always has at least two parts after splitting by spaces. In the case described in the GitHub issue, the script is simply `git`, which results in a single element after splitting. This causes the function to access an index that is out of range, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the command script has at least two elements after splitting before attempting to access the second element.
- Verify if the first element matches the expected Git stash-related command.
- Ensure the error message 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the script has at least two parts
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    if script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
``` 

By implementing the corrected version above, we address the issue of the `IndexError` by validating the number of elements after splitting the script. This ensures that the function operates correctly based on the criteria specified by the GitHub issue.
