### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr of the command contains `'usage:'`. However, the bug occurs when the function tries to split the command script and access the second element of the split. This causes an `IndexError` when the split list does not have enough elements.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The `command.script.split()` operation is raising an `IndexError` when there are no elements in the resulting list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the script will always contain at least two elements after splitting, i.e., `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in certain cases like the one described in the GitHub issue, the script might be just 'git' without any additional parameters. This causes the `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should also consider if the command script contains 'stash' at any position, not just the second position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and 'stash' in script_parts
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the script and store it in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 and if 'stash' is contained in any part of the split script. This way, we prevent the `IndexError` issue and also make the function more robust.
