## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The bug is causing an `IndexError` when trying to split the command script into words if the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments.

## Error Location
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
```
where it is trying to access the second element of the split script.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be at least two words in the `command.script`. When the script is just 'git', the split operation creates a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the logic to handle cases where there might not be a second word in the script. We can check the length of the split script before trying to access a specific index to prevent the `IndexError`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We first split the `command.script` into words and store it in `script_words`.
- We then check if the length of `script_words` is greater than or equal to 2.
- If it is, we proceed to check if the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
- If the length is less than 2, we return `False` as there is no 'stash' command to fix in this scenario.
