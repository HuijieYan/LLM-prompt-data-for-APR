## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr of the command. The bug occurs because the `script` attribute of the `command` object might not have the expected format, resulting in an IndexError when trying to split it by spaces.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The line where `command.script.split()[1]` is accessed can produce an IndexError if the script doesn't contain at least 2 words.
- The condition that checks for `'usage:' in command.stderr` might not be sufficient to determine the correct context for this rule.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to split the `script` attribute without verifying if it contains enough words. In this specific issue, the command being executed is just "git", which has no additional arguments, resulting in the `list index out of range` error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script contains at least 2 words before accessing the second word to prevent the IndexError. Additionally, we should refine the condition to check for the specific context where this rule should be applied.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first splitting the `script` attribute and checking if there are enough words, we can avoid the IndexError. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to the `git_fix_stash` rule.
