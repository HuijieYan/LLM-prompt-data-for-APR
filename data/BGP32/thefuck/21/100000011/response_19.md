### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`, leading to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs because the buggy function assumes that the script contains at least two words, with the second word being `'stash'`. However, in the provided example, the script is only `'git'`, resulting in an index out of range error.

### Error Location:
The error in the buggy function `match` is caused by assuming the presence of the second word in the script without checking the length of the script. Specifically, `command.script.split()[1]` is triggering the `IndexError` when the script does not have enough words.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function triggers the error when the script is just `'git'`, and it tries to access the second word using indexing without verifying the length of the split script. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` as the script only contains one word.

### Strategy to Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has enough words before attempting to access the second word. If the script does not contain the expected second word `'stash'`, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If the script does not meet this condition, it will return `False` without triggering an `IndexError`.
