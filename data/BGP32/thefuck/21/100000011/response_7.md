### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to match if the command script contains 'stash' as the second argument and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs when the script only has the 'git' command with no additional arguments, causing `command.script.split()` to return a list with only one element, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be more than 1 argument in the `command.script`, leading to an out-of-range index access when there is only one argument.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `command.script` has only one argument (which is the 'git' command) separately before checking for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:' to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and check if it has less than 2 parts (meaning only the 'git' command). If that is the case, we return `False` early. Otherwise, we proceed to check for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:' in the expected places without causing an `IndexError`.
