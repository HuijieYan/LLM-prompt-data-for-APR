## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `match` is a part of the `git_fix_stash` rule in thefuck. The purpose of this function is to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr of the command contains the word 'usage:'. The GitHub issue related to this bug mentions that the rule fails when the script is just `git`, resulting in an `IndexError`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function directly accesses the second element of the split script, assuming it exists without checking the length of the split list.
2. The function does not handle cases where the split list might be empty.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs when the input script does not contain any parameters or arguments after the initial `git` command. In such cases, the `command.script.split()` method returns an empty list, and accessing the second element with index `1` results in an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check the length of the split list before accessing the second element.
2. Handle cases where the split list is empty to prevent the `IndexError`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first split the script into parts and then check if the length of the split parts is greater than 1. We then access the second element to check if it is 'stash' and also verify the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. This approach ensures that we handle cases where the script may not have any additional arguments after the initial `git` command.
