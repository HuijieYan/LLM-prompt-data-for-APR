### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr includes 'usage:'. It seems that the buggy function's logic is to split the script by spaces and access the second element of the split array. This causes an error if the script doesn't contain more than one element after splitting.
2. In this case, the failing test is checking for a case where `command.script` is just `'git'`.
3. The failing test expects that when `command.script` is `'git'`, the `match` function should not raise an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result of the script has enough elements before accessing the second element.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the split script will always have at least two elements, leading to an `IndexError` when the list index is out of range.

### Fix:
We need to adjust the logic of the `match` function to handle cases where the split script does not have a sufficient number of elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
