### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.
2. The test function `test_not_match` expects the buggy function to return `False` for a `Command` instance with script as `'git'` and a `stderr` string related to git stash operations.
3. The error occurs due to IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split result of `command.script`, which happens when the script is just `'git'` and has no other parts.
4. The GitHub issue highlights this bug as well.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The fix involves checking the length of the split result before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.
- We need to modify the return condition to consider the length of the split result of `command.script`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected version should handle the case where the `command.script` is just `'git'` without causing an IndexError and cater to all expected scenarios.
