## Analysis
The buggy function is meant to check if a git command is related to stashing based on the presence of the word "stash" in the command script and the error message containing "usage:". However, the current implementation fails because it assumes the second element of `command.script.split()` exists without checking, leading to an `IndexError` when `command.script` is only "git".

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when `command.script` is "git", splitting it by whitespaces results in a single-element list (`['git']`). Since index 1 doesn't exist in a single-element list, an IndexError occurs when trying to access it in `command.script.split()[1]`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. This can prevent the IndexError from occurring. We can also simplify the condition for checking "stash" in the command script.

## Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and ('stash' in split_script or 'stash' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, we first split the command script and check if the split results in more than one element. Then, we check if either the command script or the error message contains "stash" to correctly identify stashing-related git commands. This approach avoids the IndexError and improves the logic for matching stashing commands.
