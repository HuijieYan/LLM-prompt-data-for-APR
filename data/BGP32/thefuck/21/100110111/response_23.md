## Analysis
1. The `match` function is designed to check if the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. 
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, stating that the list index is out of range, which means that `command.script.split()` has an empty list which raises the error when trying to access index `[1]`.
3. The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the `match` function returns False for a particular Command instance where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains git stash error message.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we first check if the split result has at least one element before accessing index `[1]`.
5. The corrected version of the function needs to address this IndexError by handling the scenario where the split result is empty.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the `splited_script` list has at least two elements before accessing index `[1]`, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.
