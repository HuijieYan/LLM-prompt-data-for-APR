Based on the provided information, the bug occurs in the `match` function within `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py`. The function attempts to split the `command.script` and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, splitting it results in a list with only one element, therefore causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index `1`.

To fix this bug, an additional check needs to be implemented to ensure that the script contains at least two elements before attempting to access index `1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the script contains at least 2 elements and the second element is 'stash'
    return len(splitted_script) >= 2 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By adding the check `len(splitted_script) >= 2`, we ensure that there are at least two elements in the split script before trying to access the second element. This correction should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
