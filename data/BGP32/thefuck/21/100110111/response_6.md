## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the script passed to the command starts with `git stash` and if the word `usage:` is present in the stderr. It uses the split() method on `command.script`, assuming at least two elements are present in the resulting list, which causes an IndexError when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.
  
2. The failing test `test_not_match` tries to assert that the match function should return `False` when the command's stderr includes `git stash` usage help.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where the script passed to the command is just `'git'`, resulting in an IndexError due to trying to access the second element of a list when only one element is present. This leads to the failing test throwing an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the index checking within the `match` function to ensure that there are at least two elements after splitting the script.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By adding a check for the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function can handle cases where the script does not contain the expected elements. This corrected version should resolve the IndexError and pass the failing test.
