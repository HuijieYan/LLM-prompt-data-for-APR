The buggy function fails because it assumes that the `command.script` always has at least two elements after splitting. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the `command.script` contains only one element, such as `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than or equal to 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. If the length is less than 2, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This correction ensures that the function will only compare the second element of `command.script` to 'stash' if there are at least two elements after splitting. Otherwise, it will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError` for the cases where `command.script` has fewer than two parts.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case and adhere to the expected input/output values.
