## Analysis
1. The buggy function, `match`, checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The failing test, `test_not_match`, calls the `match` function with a Command object where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the git usage information.
2. The error occurs when trying to access the second element of the split command script, causing an IndexError if the command script has only one word.
3. The failing test checks that the `match` function does not identify the provided command as a match when it is 'git'. The error message indicates an IndexError due to the attempt to access the second element in a single-word script, which was not handled properly in the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is split into words before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we might want to check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second one.
5. The corrected version of the function is presented below:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version splits the command script and then checks if it has more than one word before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.
