The buggy function is failing when the command.script contains only 'git' which results in an IndexError because it tries to access index 1 of the split command.script which does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split command.script list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. We can also include a check to verify that the first element is 'git' before proceeding to avoid potential issues in other cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if the split script has more than 1 element to avoid the IndexError. Then, it ensures that the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash' before checking for the 'usage:' string in the command's stderr.

Now, the corrected function will be able to handle the case where the script is just 'git' and will pass the failing test.
