## Analysis
The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is failing due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. This error occurs because the script passed to the function consists only of `'git'`, and hence splitting it by spaces results in a list with only one element. Trying to access index 1 in such a scenario results in an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the split command script will always have at least two elements, including the command being checked against `'stash'`. In this specific case, when the command script is just `'git'`, the function throws an error when trying to access index 1 in the list of split command script.

## Fix Strategy
We need to add a check to ensure that there are at least two elements in the split command script before attempting to access index 1. If there is only one element (e.g., the script is just `'git'`), we should return `False`.

## Updated Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script by spaces
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if there are at least two elements in the split command script
    if len(splited_script) >= 2:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    
    return False  # Return False if the split script has less than two elements
```
