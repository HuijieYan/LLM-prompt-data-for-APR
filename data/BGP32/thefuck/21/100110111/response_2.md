## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is crashing with an `IndexError` when the `split()` method is called on `command.script` as the `script` doesn't have a second element, thus leading to an index out of range error.
2. The failing test is expecting the `match` function to return `False` when given a `Command` object with script as `"git"` and stderr containing git stash error message.
3. The `match` function is supposed to check if the command is related to `stash` and if the stderr contains a specific usage message for stash.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script actually contains multiple elements before trying to access the second element to prevent the `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (
        len(command.script.split()) > 1 
        and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

## Summary
The bug in the `match` function was due to blindly accessing the second element of the script split without checking if it actually exists. By adding a check for the length of the split script before checking the element at index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` and the function now behaves as expected.
