## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr output contains "usage:". The bug occurs when the script is only "git", causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the split script.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function's implementation is assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting the command script, which causes an `IndexError` when the script is just "git".

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should first check if the split script contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1. We should also check if the command script itself is not empty to avoid potential errors.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The corrected version of the buggy function ensures that the split script contains at least two elements before checking for the presence of "stash" at index 1. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` and make the function more robust.
