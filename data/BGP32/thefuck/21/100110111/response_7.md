## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs when the `command.script` does not contain more than one word, leading to an "IndexError: list index out of range" since `command.script.split()[1]` access the second element of the split command script which doesn't exist in this case.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is due to assuming that `command.script` will always have more than one word. In the failing test case, the `command.script` is only `'git'`, without `'stash'`. This leads to the `command.script.split()` resulting in a list with only one element to access, hence causing an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command script length is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. If the split length is greater than 1, then we can check if the second element is `'stash'`. This will prevent the `IndexError` when the command script is just `'git'`.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the check for `len(split_command) > 1` before trying to access `split_command[1]`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the command script has only one word. This correction will resolve the bug and allow the function to work correctly with the failing test case.
