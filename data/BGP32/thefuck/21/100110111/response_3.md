### Analysis:
1. The `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test, `test_not_match`, assumes that the `match` function will return False for a Command with `'git'` as the script and a similar error message as `git_stash_err`.
3. The failing test shows an IndexError due to accessing the second element of an empty list, which happens when the `command.script` does not have a second word.
4. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not contain multiple words. The buggy function assumes there will be multiple words split by space.

### Bug:
- When the `command.script` contains only one word, the expression `command.script.split()[1]` raises an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
- Check if the split list contains at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
