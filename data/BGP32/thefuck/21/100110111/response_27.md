## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is expecting the second word in `command.script` to be `'stash'` and for the string `'usage:'` to be present in `command.stderr`.
2. The buggy function is encountering an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to split the `command.script`.
3. The failing test passes a `Command` object with script `'git'` and a multiline stderr message containing the usage information for the `git stash` command.
4. The expected behavior is that if the script does not contain `'stash'` as the second word and 'usage:' is present in the stderr, the function should return `False`.
5. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `'git'`.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function is assuming that `command.script` will always contain multiple words that can be split. When the script is just `'git'`, there is only one word, hence splitting it results in a list with a single element. Accessing the second element of this list causes an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can first check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can also validate the presence of `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr`. This way, the function will avoid the `IndexError` and correctly handle the case where the script is `'git'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the corrected function will check if `command.script` contains at least two words, and then it will proceed to check if the second word is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. This modification will resolve the `IndexError` issue and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
