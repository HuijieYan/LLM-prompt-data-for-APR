### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second element of the `command.script.split()` list is equal to `'stash'`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` is only `'git'` resulting in an empty list after the split operation. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to assuming there will always be at least two elements after splitting `command.script`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to first check if the split operation generates at least two elements before checking the second element.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking if `len(script_parts) > 1`, we ensure that there are at least two parts in the split result before trying to access the second element. This correction should prevent the `IndexError` and make the function behavior more robust.
