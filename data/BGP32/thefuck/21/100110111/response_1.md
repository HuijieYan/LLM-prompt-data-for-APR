Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `git_fix_stash.py` file occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`. This error happens because the script is split using whitespaces and if it does not contain multiple elements, accessing index 1 results in an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the split operation results in at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are less than two elements in the split list, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By adding the condition `len(split_script) >= 2` before accessing the second element, we ensure that an `IndexError` will not occur. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
