The issue in the buggy function is caused by assuming that the command.script always has at least two elements when split. In the failing test scenario, the command.script is only 'git' without any additional arguments, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 in the split list.

To fix this issue, we can check if the split list has a length of at least 2 before trying to access index 1. If the length is less than 2, we can simply return False, as the condition of the function won't be satisfied.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the function does not throw an IndexError when the command.script has fewer elements. It will now return False in such cases, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue and passing the failing test case.
