The buggy function `match` is failing because it directly splits the `command.script` without checking if it contains multiple elements. In the failing test function, the `stderr` of the `command` contains the usage information related to git stash, but the `command.script` is just 'git'. This leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting.

To fix this issue, we need to first ensure that `command.script` contains multiple elements before attempting to access the second element. If it contains only one element, we should return False because it does not match the condition for the git stash command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `command.script` contains at least two elements after splitting. If it does, it will proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. Otherwise, it will return False, fixing the IndexError and matching the expected behavior.
