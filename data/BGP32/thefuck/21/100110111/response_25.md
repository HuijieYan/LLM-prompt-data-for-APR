To fix the bug in the `match` function, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` does not have enough elements after splitting. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split list before accessing its elements.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Explanation:
1. The bug occurred because the original function did not check for the length of the split list before accessing its elements. When the `command.script` was just `'git'`, splitting it by whitespaces resulted in a list with only one element, and accessing index `1` caused an `IndexError`.
   
2. The corrected version first splits the `command.script` and checks if the length of the split list is greater than 1. If the split list has at least two elements and the second element is `'stash'` and `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`, then the function returns `True`, indicating a match.

By implementing this fix, the function will handle cases where the `command.script` may not contain enough elements to access element at index 1. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
