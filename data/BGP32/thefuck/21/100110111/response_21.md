### Analysis:
1. The `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The error occurs when the `command.script` only contains 'git', resulting in an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the split script.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with `script='git'` and `stderr` containing the git stash error message.
3. The expected behavior is for the function to not match in this case since the script doesn't contain 'stash'.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider cases where the `command.script` has less than two words to prevent the IndexError.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

### Updated function:
- The corrected function first splits the script into parts.
- It then checks if there are at least two parts in the script and if the second part is 'stash', along with the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

This fixes the bug by preventing the IndexError when accessing `script.split()[1]` for scripts with less than two words.
