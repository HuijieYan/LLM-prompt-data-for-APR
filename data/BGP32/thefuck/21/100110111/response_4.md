### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script starts with "stash" and if the stderr contains "usage:". However, the function fails when the script is just "git" and the stderr contains information about git commands.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` asserts that the `match` function should return False when the command script is "git" and the stderr contains git command information.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 8 of `git_fix_stash.py`, which happens when trying to access an element from the split script but the list is empty. This occurs because the split results in only ['git'], and the access to `split()[1]` triggers the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the split script results in only one element.
5. The corrected function should check if `stash` is present in the script as well as if `usage:` is present in the stderr. If either of the conditions is False, the function should return False.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False  # No 'stash' present in the script
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()[1] and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected function above checks if the split script contains at least two elements to prevent the `IndexError`. If 'stash' is present at index 1 in the split script and 'usage:' is in stderr, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This fix should address the bug and allow the function to handle cases where the script is just "git" without causing an IndexError.
