## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

### Buggy Function
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a Git command is about stashing by verifying if the command contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs due to assuming that the script can be split into multiple parts, and directly checking the second part without verifying its existence.

### Failing Test
The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the buggy function does not match when the stderr of the command provided does not contain the 'stash' keyword.

### Expected input/output values
- For the failing case:
  - command.script: 'git'
  - command.stderr: 'usage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'
  - Expected: The function should not match for this case

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from directly splitting the script using `split()[1]` without checking if the split has at least two elements. When the script is just 'git', splitting it results in a list of one element leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should ensure that the 'stash' keyword is actually present in the script.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version checks if the split script contains more than one element before comparing the second part to 'stash'. This change will prevent the IndexError when the script is a single word like 'git', ensuring the function behaves correctly.
