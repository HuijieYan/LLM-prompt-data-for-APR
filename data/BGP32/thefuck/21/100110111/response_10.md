## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the script in the command parameter starts with "stash" and if the command's stderr includes "usage:". However, the bug occurs when the script does not contain multiple elements due to the split function.
2. The bug is evident in the `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` line, where it tries to access the second element of the split script without validating its length first, leading to the `IndexError`.
3. The failing test case intends to check if the `match` function returns False for a specific scenario, but due to the bug, it raises an `IndexError` instead.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script split only if it contains elements for safer indexing and avoid the `IndexError`.

## Correction Strategy
1. Check if the command script can be split into elements before attempting to access the second element.
2. Either directly check for the script's equality with a known value or validate the split for a sufficient number of elements for safe indexing.
3. Handle the case where the split operation may not provide enough elements to prevent the IndexError.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splitted_script) >= 2:
        return splitted_script[0] == 'git' and splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

Now, the corrected version of the `match` function will safely check if the script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr without causing an `IndexError`.
