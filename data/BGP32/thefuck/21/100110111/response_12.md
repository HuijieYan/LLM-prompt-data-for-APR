The buggy function is checking if the script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The error is occurring due to an IndexError when trying to access the second element in the split script. The buggy function does not account for cases where the script does not contain more than one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split script contains at least two elements before accessing the index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This modification ensures that the split script has at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. This fixed version should pass the failing test case and handle the edge case where the script may not contain sufficient elements after splitting.
