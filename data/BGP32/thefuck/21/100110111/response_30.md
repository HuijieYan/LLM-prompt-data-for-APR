## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs because it tries to access the index 1 of the split script list directly without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the split script is only 1 element long.

The failing test `test_not_match` aims to verify that the buggy function returns False when the command is not a 'git stash' command.

The expected input values for the failing test are a command with script `'git'` and stderr containing the git stash usage information. The expected output is `False`.

The GitHub issue also confirms the `IndexError` and provides information that the rule fails when the script only contains 'git'.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `match` function, we need to first check whether the script has at least two elements after splitting before accessing index 1. This will prevent the `IndexError` that occurs when trying to access an element that does not exist.

## Corrected Code
```python
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and 
            command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will ensure that there are at least two elements in the split script list before comparing the second element to 'stash', preventing any `IndexError` from occurring. The function will return False for commands that do not match the specified conditions.
