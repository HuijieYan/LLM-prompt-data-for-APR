The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it assumes the input command has a script with at least two parts (split by spaces), which is not always the case. This assumption leads to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the split script has at least two parts before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

By adding the check `if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:`, we ensure that we only access the second part of the split script if it exists. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This correction will prevent the `IndexError` when the split script has fewer than two parts, resolving the bug and allowing the function to work as expected for the provided test case.
