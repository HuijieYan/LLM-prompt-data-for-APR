## Analysis
The buggy function `match` expects the second word in the `command.script` to be 'stash' and 'usage:' to be in `command.stderr`. The issue arises when `command.script` is just 'git' causing an `IndexError` as `split` creates a list with only one element.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the assumption made in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. When `command.script` is just 'git', the split operation results in a list with one element, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing index 1.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split creates at least two elements before performing the comparison. 

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()

    if len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

Now, the corrected version first checks if there are at least two elements after splitting the command script before proceeding with the comparison. This change ensures that an IndexError will not occur and the correct condition is met.
