## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is throwing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is split and the second element is compared to `'stash'`. The error occurs when the script is just `'git'`, which leads to an empty list after splitting.

### Error Cause:
The buggy function doesn't handle the case where there is no second element after splitting the `command.script`, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the buggy function to check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding `len(splited_script) > 1` to the condition, we ensure that the script has at least two elements before accessing the second element for comparison.

### Expected Equalizer
The corrected function should handle the case when `command.script = 'git'` and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

By implementing the corrected function, the failing test case `test_not_match` should pass successfully without any errors.
