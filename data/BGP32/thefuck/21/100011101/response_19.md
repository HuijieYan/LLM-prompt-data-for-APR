## Correction

The buggy function is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if there actually is a second element. To fix this, we need to first ensure that there are at least two elements in the split command and then compare the second element to 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) >= 2 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
```

This correction first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This way, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
