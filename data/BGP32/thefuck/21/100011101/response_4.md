The issue with the current implementation is that it expects the script to be split into multiple parts, and then it directly accesses the second element without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that is out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By first checking if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1, we ensure that we avoid the `IndexError` when accessing the second element. This fix should now allow the function to handle the provided test case correctly.
