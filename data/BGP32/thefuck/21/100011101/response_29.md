The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` by whitespaces and access the second element (index 1) to check if it is equal to 'stash'. However, the error message is indicating an "IndexError: list index out of range", meaning that the split operation is not resulting in multiple elements as expected.

The issue lies in the fact that the `command.script` provided does not contain any whitespace to split. This leads to a list with only one element (index 0), hence trying to access index 1 raises an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the split operation results in at least two elements before accessing the second element. If not, we can safely assume that the condition will not be met in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we first check if the length of `splited_script` is greater than or equal to 2 before attempting to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and the function should now work as expected.
