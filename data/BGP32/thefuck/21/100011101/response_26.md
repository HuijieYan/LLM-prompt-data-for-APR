### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second element of the split `script` is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `script` only contains one element (`['git']`), which causes the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `script` contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this fix, the function will first check if the `script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError and ensure that the correct conditions are met for the function to return `True`.
