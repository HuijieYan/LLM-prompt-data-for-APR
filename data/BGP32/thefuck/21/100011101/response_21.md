### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the `command.script` attribute will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` only contains one element (`'git'`), leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains enough elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing any specific index.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` attribute and then checks if there are enough elements in the resulting list before accessing the second element. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and fix the bug.
