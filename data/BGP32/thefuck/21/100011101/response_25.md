The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range", which suggests that the split operation on the script is not producing the expected number of elements.

The cause of the bug is that some commands do not have a second word to split, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access index 1 in the split list.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split operation produces at least two elements before trying to access index 1. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated function first checks if the length of the split script list is at least 2 before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This modification ensures that the function avoids the IndexError that was occurring before.
