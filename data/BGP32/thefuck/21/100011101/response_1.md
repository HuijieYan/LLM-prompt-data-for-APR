The bug in the provided function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts based on whitespace and accessed at index 1. Since the `command.script` provided in the failing test only contains the command "git" and does not have any additional parts, attempting to access index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of `split_script`, we ensure that we only access index 1 if it exists. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
