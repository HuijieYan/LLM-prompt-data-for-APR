### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` only contains `'git'`, so splitting it by whitespace will result in a list with only one element. When trying to access the second element of this list, an `IndexError` occurs, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain the expected elements before trying to access the second element of the split result. We can check if the split result has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

This corrected version of the function first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the split result has at least two elements before proceeding with the comparison. If there are not enough elements, it returns `False`.
