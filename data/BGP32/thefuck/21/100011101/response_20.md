### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second element in the split command script is equal to 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range", which means that there might be an issue with accessing the second element in the split script when the script does not have two elements.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the command script does not contain the expected number of elements after splitting. If the script is just 'git' without any arguments, accessing index 1 will lead to an IndexError.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking that the length of splited_script is at least 2 before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.
