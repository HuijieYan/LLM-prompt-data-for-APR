The bug in the provided function is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespaces and access the second element assuming it exists, which is not always the case. The error occurs when the command script is just `'git'`, without any additional arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that at least two elements exist after splitting the command script before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the script is splitted and that there are at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This fix should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as expected.
