The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to split the `script` attribute of the `Command` object without checking if it contains more than one element. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that `command.script` contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix checks if the `splited_script` list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.

With this fix in place, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
