The bug in the provided function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` can be split and accessed at index 1 without checking if it contains at least two elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 of the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If not, the function should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version checks if the split script has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If it doesn't, it returns False, avoiding the `IndexError`. This should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
