The bug in the function `match` is caused by assuming that the `split()[1]` operation on `command.script` will always have an element at index 1. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` value is just `'git'`, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 after splitting.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing index 1 to prevent the IndexError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there are enough elements in the split script before trying to access index 1. This change ensures that the bug causing the IndexError is fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test case.
