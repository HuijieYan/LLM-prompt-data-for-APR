The bug in the current function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` can be split into multiple parts and accessing the second element directly without proper validation. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the length of the split result is less than 2.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script can be split and contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

By adding a check for the length of the split script, we ensure that we avoid the `IndexError`. If the split script has at least two elements, we proceed with the comparison, otherwise, we return `False` to indicate that the command does not match.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
