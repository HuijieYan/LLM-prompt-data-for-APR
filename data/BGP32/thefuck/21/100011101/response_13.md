The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the error message. The error message indicates an IndexError in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split command.script list without checking if it exists, leading to an IndexError in cases where the command.script does not have enough elements after splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command.script and checks if the length of the list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.
