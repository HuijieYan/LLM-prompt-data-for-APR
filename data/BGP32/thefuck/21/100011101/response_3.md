The buggy function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash', and also check if 'usage:' is in the stderr message. However, there is an IndexError occurring because the script is being split on whitespaces, and if there is no second element (when the command is only 'git'), an error is raised.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script on whitespaces
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        # Check if the second element is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in stderr
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected function first checks if the split script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. If not, it returns False, indicating that the condition for matching is not met. This fix should prevent the IndexError and pass the failing test case.
