### Analysis
The buggy function is trying to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the script is split into a list where there are not enough elements to access the index 1.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the script is not split correctly into separate words, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split script.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script is split correctly and has enough elements before accessing index 1.

### Corrected code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first splitting the script into individual words and then checking for the conditions, we avoid the IndexError and ensure that the function works correctly.
