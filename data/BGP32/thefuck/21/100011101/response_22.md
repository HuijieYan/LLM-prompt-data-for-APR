The buggy function is checking if the second element of the `command.script.split()` equals to `'stash'`, but in the given input, the split command results in only one element `['git']`, leading to an `IndexError`. This error occurs because the function assumes there will always be at least two elements after splitting the script.

To fix this issue, we need to check the length of the split result before trying to access the second element to prevent the `IndexError`. Additionally, we should also check if the command.stderr contains the specific string `'usage:'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle cases where the script cannot be split into at least two elements, which would avoid the `IndexError` and the function will behave as expected.
