The bug in the provided function is due to an IndexError that occurs when trying to access the second element (index 1) of the split command script. The error message indicates "IndexError: list index out of range", which means that the split operation did not create a list with at least two elements, leading to the index being out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split command script has enough elements before trying to access index 1. We can also add a check to verify that the split script contains at least two elements before proceeding with the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This fix includes a check to verify that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If the split script does not have enough elements, the function will return False, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
