### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` into a list and then compare the second element of the list with the string `'stash'`. However, in this case, the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which means that splitting it will result in a list with only one element. Therefore, trying to access the second element of the list will cause an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element for comparison.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
