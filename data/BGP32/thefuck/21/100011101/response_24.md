### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to split the command script by spaces and access the element at index 1 without checking if there are actually enough elements in the split result. In this case, the script only contains one part ('git') so accessing index 1 will result in an out-of-range error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has enough elements before trying to access index 1. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before attempting to access any element.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the script before accessing elements and checking if there are enough parts in the split result, we avoid the `IndexError` and the function will work correctly.
