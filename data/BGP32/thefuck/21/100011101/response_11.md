The buggy function is trying to split the script by spaces and check if the second element is 'stash', and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. The error message is pointing to an "IndexError: list index out of range" which indicates that the script does not have a second element to check in the split.

The cause of the bug is that when the script is split and it does not contain multiple elements, accessing the second element leads to an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we only access the second element if the split script contains at least two elements. This way, we avoid the index out of range error.
