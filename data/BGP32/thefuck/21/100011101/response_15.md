The buggy function is checking if the second element in the list obtained by splitting the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` does not contain the word `'stash'`, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the list obtained by splitting `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If the list is too short, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splitted_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (splitted_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element. If the list is too short, it will return `False`, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
