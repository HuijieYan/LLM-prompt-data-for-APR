The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` attribute based on spaces and then checking if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the split operation is not generating enough elements to access the second index.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function assumes that splitting `command.script` will always generate at least two elements, but in this case, with `command.script` being `'git'`, splitting it will result in a list with only one element. When trying to access the second index (index 1), it raises an IndexError due to the lack of elements.

### Fix strategy:
We can fix this bug by first checking if the split operation generates at least two elements before trying to access the second index. This way, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splited_script` first, we ensure that accessing index 1 is safe before comparing it to `'stash'`. This correction should resolve the IndexError issue and pass the failing test.
