### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" which means that the split operation on the command script is failing when the script doesn't have enough words to split.

The expected input values are a valid git command script and corresponding stderr output. The function should split the command script and check if the second word is 'stash' while also confirming the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the command script doesn't have a second word to split, resulting in an IndexError during the comparison check.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can also improve the check for 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By first checking if the split script has at least two words, we prevent the IndexError. If the split operation fails, we return False to indicate that the match condition is not met.
