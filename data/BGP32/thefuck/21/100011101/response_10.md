### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is checking if the second element in the command's script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` on the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which means that the script does not have a second element to split.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `script` in the `command` is not empty and has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should check if 'stash' is the first element in the split `script`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
