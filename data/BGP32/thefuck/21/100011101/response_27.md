### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` to check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which does not have a second element to access. This causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
2. Ensure that the second element is equal to `'stash'`.
3. Check if the `'usage:'` string is present in `command.stderr` to confirm the command to fix.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
