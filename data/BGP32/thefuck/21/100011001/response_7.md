### Explanation
The buggy function `match()` is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it actually exists. In this case, the command script is just `'git'`, so splitting it and accessing index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this correction, the function will first split the command script and then check if there are at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This change will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
