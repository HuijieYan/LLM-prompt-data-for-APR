### Explanation
The function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces (`command.script.split()[1]`) without checking if the input is valid. This leads to an `IndexError` when `split()` does not return enough elements to index with `[1]`.

### Solution
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains multiple elements before trying to access the second element. We can do this by splitting the `command.script` and checking the length of the resulting list.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first splitting the script into parts and checking the length, we ensure that accessing the second element is safe and prevents the `IndexError`.
