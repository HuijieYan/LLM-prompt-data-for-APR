### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the script part of the command and check if the second part is equal to 'stash'. However, in this case, the command.script only contains 'git' which leads to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 after splitting.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the command.script split is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the split command.script first, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring.
