### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, in the failing test case, the command script is just 'git' and does not contain the word 'stash', leading to an IndexError when trying to split the script with `command.script.split()[1]`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script contains the word 'stash' before attempting to split it. This can prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

### Justification
In this corrected version, we first split the command script into words using `command.script.split()`. Then, we check if the list of words has more than one element (to prevent IndexError), if the second word is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. This approach fixes the bug and ensures that the function behaves correctly.
