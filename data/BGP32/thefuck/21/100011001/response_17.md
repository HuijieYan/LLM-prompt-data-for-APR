The buggy function is checking if the second element of the split command is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the split command does not have a second element, causing an index out of range error.

The problem lies in assuming that the split command will always have at least two elements. In this case, the `git` command itself does not have a second element after splitting.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_split) > 1 and command_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we only try to access the second element of the split command if it has at least two elements.
