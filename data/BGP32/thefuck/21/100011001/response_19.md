### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and access the second element to check if it equals to `'stash'`. This approach leads to an `IndexError` because the split operation does not guarantee the presence of a second element in the resulting list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) >= 2
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
``` 

By ensuring that `script_parts` contains at least two elements before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from being raised. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
