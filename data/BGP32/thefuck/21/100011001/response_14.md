### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` by spaces and access the second element to check if it is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test scenario, the `command.script` does not contain the word `'stash'`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the resulting list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to first check if the split `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the check for `'stash'` is case-insensitive, as the command might be in various cases.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and 'stash' in split_script[1].lower() and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

With this correction, the function checks if the split script has at least two elements, then checks if the second element (case-insensitive) contains `'stash'`. This fix should prevent the `IndexError` and address the issue causing the failing test.
