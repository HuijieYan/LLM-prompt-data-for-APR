### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which means that `command.script.split()` is resulting in an empty list, and accessing index 1 from it is causing the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `command.script` is splitting into an empty list due to no whitespace separated elements in the string, resulting in an empty list. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 from an empty list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1. This can be done by checking the length of the split list.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version first splits the `command.script` into `split_script` and then checks if `split_script` has more than 1 element before comparing with 'stash'. This fix ensures that the index out of range error is avoided.
