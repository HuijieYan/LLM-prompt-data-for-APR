### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter and access the second element to check if it is equal to `'stash'`. However, the `command` being passed to the function does not have enough elements in the split list, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the `script` attribute of `command` will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. In this case, the `script` attribute only contains one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
We need to first check if the `script` attribute has enough elements after splitting before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return `False`.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
