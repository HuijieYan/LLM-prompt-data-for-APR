### Analysis
- The function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` which means that the `split()` method is trying to access an index that doesn't exist, leading to a list index out of range.
- The `command.script` value is `'git'` which does not have a second word after splitting.
- This causes the `IndexError` in the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to ensure that we check for the length of the split result before trying to access the second element.
- We should also add a condition to check if the second element exists before comparing it to `'stash'`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` first, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
