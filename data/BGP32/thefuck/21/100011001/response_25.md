The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. The bug in the function is causing an `IndexError` because the function is trying to access index 1 of `command.script.split()` without checking if the split actually contains at least 2 elements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `split()` function doesn't return a list with at least 2 elements for the given input.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now the function checks if `split_command` has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
