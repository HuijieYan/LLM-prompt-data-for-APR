The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute with a space and then compare the second element to the string `'stash'`. However, if the `command.script` attribute does not contain multiple elements separated by spaces, the `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` as observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` attribute contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will first split the `command.script` attribute and then check if there are at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This change will prevent the `IndexError` observed in the failing test.
