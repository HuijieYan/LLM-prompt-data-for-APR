### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, when the `command.script` only contains `'git'`, splitting it would result in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split result before trying to access the second element. If the split result has at least two elements, we can compare the second element with `'stash'`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError`. Now the function should work correctly for the provided test case.
