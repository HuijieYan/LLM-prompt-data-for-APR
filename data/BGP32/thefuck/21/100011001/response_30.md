### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr. The error occurs when `command.script` does not contain multiple words, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access index `[1]` in the split list.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function assumes that the script will always have at least two words (command name and argument). When the script does not contain additional words after the initial command name, an `IndexError` is raised when trying to access index `[1]` of the split list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list contains at least two elements before accessing index `[1]`. We also need to validate that the script contains the word `'stash'` and that `'usage:'` is present in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing index `[1] and updating the conditions accordingly, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
