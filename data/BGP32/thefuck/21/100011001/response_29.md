The bug in the `match` function arises from the assumption that the input command has at least two elements after splitting by spaces. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when accessing `command.script.split()[1]` if there is no second element in the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split list before attempting to access the second element. We can also add a check to ensure that the first element is `'git'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split list has at least two elements, then verify that the first element is `'git'` and the second element is `'stash'`, before checking for the presence of `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
