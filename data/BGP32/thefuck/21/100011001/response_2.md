### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `command.script` is split using whitespaces and then the second element is checked for equality with `'stash'`. However, if the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace (like in this case where it is just `'git'`), splitting it will result in a list with only one element. Trying to access the second element of a list with only one element causes an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second one.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
