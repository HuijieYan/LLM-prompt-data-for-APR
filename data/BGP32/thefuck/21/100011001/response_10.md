### Explanation
The buggy function is trying to split the command script using whitespaces and then access the second element to check if it is `'stash'`. However, in the provided test case, the command script contains only one element (`'git'`), so accessing index 1 raises an `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should first check if the script contains at least two elements before trying to access index 1. If not, it means the command is not related to stash, and we can return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function handles cases where the command script does not contain the expected parameters.
