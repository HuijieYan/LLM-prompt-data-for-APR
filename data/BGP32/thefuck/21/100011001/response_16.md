### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second element in the `command.script.split()` list is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test case provided, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, so when splitting this string and trying to access the second element, an `IndexError` is raised because there is no second element in the list.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
We need to first check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) >= 2
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After applying this fix, the corrected function will handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to split into before trying to access the second element. This should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
