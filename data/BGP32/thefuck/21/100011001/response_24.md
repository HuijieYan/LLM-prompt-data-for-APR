### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script using spaces and access the second element (index 1) to check if it is equal to 'stash'. However, in this case, the command script does not contain the word 'stash' at index 1, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before trying to access index 1. This check will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By implementing this fix, we are ensuring that the split command script has at least 2 elements before checking if the second element is 'stash'. This correction should resolve the IndexError issue.
