### Explanation:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script by spaces and access the second element to compare it with `'stash'`. However, in this case, the command script is simply `'git'`, which means there are not enough elements to split and access the index 1. This leads to the error `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we should first check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before trying to access index 1. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, we ensure that there are enough elements to compare and avoid the IndexError.
