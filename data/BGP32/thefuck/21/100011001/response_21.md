### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`, and if the `command.stderr` contains the word `'usage:'`. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the `split()` method on `command.script` is failing because there are not enough elements to split.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `command.script` always has at least two words when splitting. In this case, `command.script` only contains one word ('git'), leading to the IndexError when attempting to access the second element.

### Fix Strategy
We need to first check if the `command.script` contains more than one word before trying to access the second element. We can also add a check to ensure that the `command.stderr` is not empty before searching for the word `'usage:'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
