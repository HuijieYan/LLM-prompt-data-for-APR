### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError`, which means that the `split()` method is trying to access an index that does not exist in the input.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `split()` method is used without checking if there are at least two words in the command script. In this specific case, the command script is simply `'git'`, so when trying to access the second element in the split list, an `IndexError` is raised.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can modify the function to check the length of the split list before accessing the index. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 
            and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking if the length of `words` is greater than 1, we ensure that the script has at least two words before trying to access the second word. This corrected version should address the `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
