### Explanation
The buggy function is expecting the second word in the `command.script` to be 'stash' and also checking if the word 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs when the `command.script` does not contain any space-separated words to split, resulting in an empty list, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` has at least two words before attempting to access the second word. We also need to ensure that `command.stderr` is not `None` before checking for the presence of 'usage:'.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr is not None
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting `command.script` into words and verifying its length before accessing the second word, the corrected version of the function avoids the `IndexError` that was occurring. Additionally, we now also check if `command.stderr` is not `None` before checking for the presence of 'usage:', ensuring that the function works correctly with various inputs.
