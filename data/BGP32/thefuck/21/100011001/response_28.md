### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` attribute and check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, when the command is just `'git'`, there will be no second element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access it. This results in the failing test since the `stderr` contains 'usage:', but the function fails due to the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has multiple elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and allow us to properly check for the presence of `'stash'` in the command script.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
