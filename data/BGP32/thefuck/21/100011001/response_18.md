### Explanation
The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" occurs because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split result of `command.script`, assuming that it exists. However, the split operation may not always return a list with at least two elements, leading to the IndexError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By splitting `command.script` beforehand and checking if the split result has more than one element, we avoid the IndexError.
