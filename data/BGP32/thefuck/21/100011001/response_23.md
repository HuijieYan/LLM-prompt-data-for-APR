### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the command stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the split operation on the script is failing because there are no words to split, causing an empty list.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the split operation on the empty string `git` in the script results in an empty list, and trying to access the second element of an empty list leads to an `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split operation is performed on a non-empty script. We can achieve this by first checking if the script contains more than one word before attempting to access the second word.

### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This updated function checks if there are more than one word in the script before accessing the second word to avoid the `IndexError`.
