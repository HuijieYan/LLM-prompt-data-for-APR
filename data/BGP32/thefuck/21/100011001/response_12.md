### Analysis
The function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is `'git'`, so when trying to split it by spaces and access the second element, it causes an `IndexError` because there is no second element. This is why the test is failing.

### Fix
We need to first check if the split `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second one to avoid the `IndexError`. Additionally, we need to consider `command.stderr` instead of the `command.stderr`'s lowercase version. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

After making this fix, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
