### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. The error occurs because the function assumes that there will always be at least two words in the command script. However, in the failing test, the command script is only 'git', resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second word in the split command.script list.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the command script has at least two words before accessing the second word. We can also add a check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr of the command to ensure both conditions are met before returning True.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By explicitly checking the length of the script_words list before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring.
