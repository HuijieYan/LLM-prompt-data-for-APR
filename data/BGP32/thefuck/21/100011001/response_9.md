### Explanation
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`; however, in the provided test case, `command.script` is `'git'`, which causes the `command.script.split()[1]` to throw an `IndexError` since there is no second word in the split result.

### Fix
We need to modify the logic inside the `match` function to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain the expected keyword `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version checks if there are at least two words in the `command.script` before comparing the second word to `'stash'`. If there are not enough words, it returns `False` directly. This should fix the `IndexError` issue and make the function more robust.
