The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split command script (command.script.split()[1]) without checking if there are enough elements in the split list. This is causing the "IndexError: list index out of range" when the split command script does not result in multiple elements.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This prevents the "IndexError: list index out of range" from occurring.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
