## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to Git stash by looking for the keyword 'stash' in the command script and checking if the 'usage:' string is present in the stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element in the split script but fails. The failing test `test_not_match` provides the required setup for the buggy function. The expected input/output values are provided, showing that the script should not match in this case.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the script split without checking if there are elements in the split list. In this specific case, where the script is only 'git', there is no second element to access in the split list, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to account for the case where the split script may not have enough elements to access. One approach is to first check if the split script list has enough elements before trying to access the second element.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` in cases where the script does not include the keyword 'stash'. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and not throw any errors.
