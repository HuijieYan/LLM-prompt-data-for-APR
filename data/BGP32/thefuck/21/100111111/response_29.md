## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` is checking the function with a Command where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage instructions for git stash.
2. The error occurs at `command.script.split()[1]` because when the script is 'git', splitting it by spaces will only result in one element in the list, causing an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test provides a Command where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the git stash usage, which does not match the conditions of the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the script contains 'git stash' and eliminate the need to split the script.
5. The corrected function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'git stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

By checking if 'git stash' is present in the script, we don't need to split the script by spaces and avoid the `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
