The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when using `split()[1]`. In the failing test case, the `command.script` only contains one element (`'git'`), leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element (`'stash'`). 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check the length of the `command.script` after splitting before trying to access specific elements in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script and check if there are at least two elements
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing specific elements, we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy version. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
