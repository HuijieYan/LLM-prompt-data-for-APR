To fix the bug in the `match` function of `git_fix_stash.py`, we need to address the `IndexError: list index out of range`. The bug occurs because the function assumes that there will always be at least two elements in `command.script.split()`, which is not always the case.

### Bug Explanation:
- **Buggy Function**:
  - The buggy function checks if the second word in the command script is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is present in the command's stderr.
- **Failing Test**:
  - The failing test provides a `Command` object where the `command.script` is `'git'`, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split script.
- **Error Message**:
  - The error message explicitly states an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access the second element of a list with only one element.
- **Runtime Values**:
  - The runtime values show that the split script only has one element, causing the `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to handle cases where the split script might not have multiple elements to avoid the `IndexError`. One way to address this issue is to explicitly check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we ensure that the code does not throw an `IndexError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle scenarios where the script split does not contain enough elements.
