## Analysis
The buggy function `match` fails to handle cases where the `script` attribute of the `command` is just `'git'`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script. The condition in the return statement is not checking for the length of the split script before attempting to access the second element.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the assumption that there will always be at least two elements in the split script, leading to an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element. This check will prevent the `IndexError` when the script is only `'git'`.

## Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, we first check if the split script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This avoids the `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.
