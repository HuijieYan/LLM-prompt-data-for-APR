## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The failing test `test_not_match` is trying to ensure that the function doesn't match in a specific scenario. However, the buggy function is failing with an `IndexError`.

The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurs when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` if it doesn't have a second element. This error is due to the assumption that there will always be a second element after splitting `command.script`. In this case, since `command.script` is just 'git', splitting it won't give a second element causing the `IndexError`.

## Solution
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If not, the function should not match. We can achieve this by checking the length of the split `command.script` before accessing the second word.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError`. This corrected version ensures the function behaves correctly in cases where the script only consists of a single word.
