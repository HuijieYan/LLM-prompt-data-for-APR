## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second element in the split `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with `script` value as 'git' and `stderr` containing git stash information.
3. The error occurs due to the `command.script.split()[1]` accessing a list index that is out of range since the `script` only contains 'git' without any other elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to ensure it doesn't attempt to access an index that is out of range. We should check if there are at least two elements in the `command.script.split()` list before comparing the second element with 'stash'.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By first checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the index, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
