## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `'usage:'` string is present in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test is trying to assert that the `match` function does not match a particular command, but it fails with an `IndexError`.
3. The error occurs because when splitting the script by spaces, if the script contains only one word (like `'git'` in this case), accessing index 1 will result in an `IndexError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) >= 2
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of `splited_script` before accessing index 1, we can avoid the `IndexError` when the script contains only one word. This fix ensures that the function operates correctly even with scripts that do not have multiple words.
