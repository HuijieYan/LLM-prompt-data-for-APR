## Bug Analysis

1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' at index 1 and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the bug arises when the command script contains only one element (in this case, just 'git') as the script is split and indexed at 1, causing the `IndexError`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a `Command` object with a script 'git' and an error message containing 'usage:', which triggers the `IndexError` in the buggy `match` function.
3. The failing test runtime values indicate that the script contains only 'git' and the error message contains 'usage:', which leads to the `IndexError` due to the split and indexing operation in the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script contains only one word (no splitting necessary) and ensure that the 'stash' keyword is present in the command script and the 'usage:' keyword in the error message before returning a match.
5. The fix should address the specific case where the script contains only one word and adjust the condition appropriately.

## Bug Fix

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing index 1, we prevent the `IndexError` when the script contains only one word. This fix ensures that the script contains the 'stash' keyword and the error message contains 'usage:' for a valid match.
