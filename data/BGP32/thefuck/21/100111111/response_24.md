The bug in the `match` function is due to trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the list contains only one element.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the `command.script.split()` list before trying to access its elements. If the list has at least two elements, we can proceed with the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This correction ensures that the function does not throw an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second element of the split script command. Now, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
