### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `match` is expecting the second word from the `command.script` to be `'stash'` and also checking if `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when given a `command` object with `script='git'` and `stderr` containing the git stash usage information.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 8 of `git_fix_stash.py`, suggesting that `command.script.split()` is empty since the script is just `'git'`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes there will be at least two words in `command.script`, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second word that doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
Check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. If not, return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version adds a check to verify that there are at least two words in the `command.script` before trying to access the second word, preventing the `IndexError`.
