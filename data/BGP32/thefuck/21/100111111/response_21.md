## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash', while also checking if the word 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error occurs because when the `command.script` is just 'git', splitting it would result in a single-element list causing the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

## Solution
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access index 1. Additionally, we need to keep the second condition checking for 'usage:' in `command.stderr` as it is a valid check for the git stash command.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function will now correctly handle cases where the `command.script` is just 'git', preventing the IndexError.
