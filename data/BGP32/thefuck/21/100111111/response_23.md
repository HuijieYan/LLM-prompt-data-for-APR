## Analysis
- The buggy function `match` is meant to check if the command passed is about git stash and if the error message contains "usage:".
- The failing test `test_not_match` does not provide a command script specifically about git stash, causing the `split()` operation in the buggy function to fail.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to trying to access index 1 of the split command script list when it might not exist.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the split command script list has at least 2 elements before accessing the index 1. If it contains less than 2 elements, it means the command script was not specifically about git stash, and we should return False.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

Now, the function ensures that it won't throw an `IndexError` by first checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access index 1. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
