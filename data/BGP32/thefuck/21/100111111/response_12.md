The buggy function fails because it tries to access an index in the list of `command.script.split()` without considering the possibility of an empty list returned by the split operation. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of an empty list.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split operation returns a non-empty list before trying to access its elements.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first assign the result of `command.script.split()` to `split_script` and then check if the length of the list is greater than 1 (at least two elements) before accessing the second element. This ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when the list is empty.
