### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then check if the second element is equal to `'stash'`. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` is `'git'`, and splitting it results in a list with only one element. Trying to access the second element of this list causes an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the code should first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring in cases where the script does not contain multiple words.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By including the `len(split_script) > 1` check, the corrected function ensures that it only tries to access the second element of the split script when it actually exists. This modification should resolve the `IndexError` issue identified in the failing test.
