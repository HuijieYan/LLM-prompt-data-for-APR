### Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` takes a command and checks if the second word in the script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` expects that the function should not match when the command script is just `'git'`.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to trying to access the second element of the split script, which leads to an empty array.
4. The expected behavior is to not match when the script is just `'git'`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `split` function on an empty script (`'git'`) results in an empty list, and trying to access the second element of this empty list causes an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
Before accessing the second element of the split script, we need to ensure that the split script contains more than one element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the element, we can prevent the `IndexError` and fix the bug.
