The buggy function is comparing the second element of `command.script.split()` with `'stash'`, which leads to an `IndexError` when the split list does not have a second element. The explanation is that when the script is just `'git'`, the split list will only have one element ('git'), causing the index out of range error.

To fix this issue, we need to change the condition in the return statement to first check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

The corrected version checks if the length of `split_script` is at least 2 before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This fix ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` when the split list does not have enough elements.
