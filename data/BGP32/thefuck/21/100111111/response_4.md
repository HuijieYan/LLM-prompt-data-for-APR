## Fixing the Bug

### Analyzing the Bug
The buggy function `match` has an issue where it tries to split the `command.script` using whitespace and accesses the second element `[1]` directly without checking if the array returned by the split is long enough. This causes an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

### Bug Cause
The buggy code in the `match` function directly accesses the second element of the split command script without ensuring that there are at least two elements after the split. When the script is just `'git'`, there is only one element in the split list, leading to an `IndexError` during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the split list has more than one element before trying to access the second element.
2. Return False if the split list doesn't have enough elements or if the condition is not satisfied.

### Updated `match` Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the script is related to stash and contains 'usage:'
    parts = command.script.split()
    return len(parts) >= 2 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the `parts` list after splitting the `command.script`, we ensure that there are at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring when the script contains only one element like in the case of `'git'`.
