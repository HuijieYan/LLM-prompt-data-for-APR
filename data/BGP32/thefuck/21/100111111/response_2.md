## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the command stderr.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` provides a Command object with script set to 'git' and stderr containing git stash related usage information.
3. The error message shows an `IndexError` on line 8, indicating that `command.script.split()[1]` is causing the issue. In this case, the script 'git' does not have a second word to split.
4. The expected input for the test includes 'git' as the script in Command, which should lead to the function returning False.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the script doesn't have a second word before trying to access it. We can do this by first checking if the split result has enough elements before comparing the second word.

## Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# The corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will check if the split script has enough elements before comparing the second word to 'stash', resolving the IndexError issue.
