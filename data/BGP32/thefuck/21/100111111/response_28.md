## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` is designed to check whether a specific command is executed in the Git shell with an error message indicating the correct usage. However, the bug occurs due to assuming that the `command.script` can be split into multiple elements, resulting in an `IndexError`.
2. The bug is identified in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which attempts to access the second element of the split command. If the command does not have a second element, it raises an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test provides a command with the script `'git'` and an error message containing `'usage:'`. Since the command script is only `'git'`, attempting to split it and access the second element raises the `IndexError`.
4. To resolve the bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. This ensures that the index is valid before accessing it.
5. The corrected version will include a check for the number of elements in the split command before comparing and returning the result accordingly.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return len(split_command) >= 2 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the split command first, we ensure that accessing the second element is safe. This correction prevents the `IndexError` and allows the function to properly match the desired command execution scenario.
