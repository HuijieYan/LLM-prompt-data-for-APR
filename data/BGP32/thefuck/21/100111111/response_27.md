## Error Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the `command.script` contains the word "stash" and if "usage:" is present in the `command.stderr`. However, the bug causing the IndexError is due to the assumption that splitting the `command.script` on a space will generate multiple elements, one of which should be "stash".

In the failing test, the `command.script` is simply "git", which means after splitting on a space, there will only be one element in the list which leads to the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `command.script` is just "git" separately. We can check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access index 1.

## The Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `match` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the `splitted_script` list has more than one element before accessing index 1, we prevent the IndexError in cases where `command.script` is just "git". This modification ensures that the function handles the input correctly and passes the failing test.
