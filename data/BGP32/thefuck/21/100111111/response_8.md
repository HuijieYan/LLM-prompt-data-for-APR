## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. The failing test `test_not_match` creates a `Command` object with script as `'git'` and stderr containing the usage information for `git stash` command. The expected behavior is that this command should not match the conditions in the `match` function.

The error occurs due to the assumption that `command.script` will contain multiple words to split. In this case, `'git'` alone is provided, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index `1` in the split list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where there may not be multiple words in `command.script`. We can first check if `command.script` has enough words to split before accessing any specific index.

## Bug Fix Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the split script before accessing index `1`, we avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring previously. This fix should ensure that the function works correctly for cases where there are not enough words in the script to split into multiple parts.
