## Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The provided failing test is checking if the buggy function does not match when providing a `Command` object where `command.script` is just `'git'`, causing an `IndexError` due to the split function trying to access the second element of a single-element list.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function is the assumption that there will always be at least two elements in the split list of `command.script`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `command.script` has only one word, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list of `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if script contains 'stash' and 'usage:'
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into words and then check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before comparing the second word with `'stash'`. If the length is sufficient, we perform the comparison and look for `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`. If the length is less than 2, we return `False` to indicate no match.
