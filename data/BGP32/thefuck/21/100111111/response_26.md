The bug stems from the function `match` trying to access index `1` of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if the list has at least two elements. This causes an `IndexError` when `command.script` does not contain enough elements to split.

To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that `command.script.split()` has enough elements before trying to access index `1`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This change should prevent the `IndexError` and allow the function to work correctly.
