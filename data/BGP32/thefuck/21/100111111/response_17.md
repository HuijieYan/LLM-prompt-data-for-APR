## Analysis
1. The buggy function `match` receives a `command` as a parameter, and it checks if the script in the command contains the word 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.
2. The failing test `test_not_match` checks if the `match` function returns false when the script in the command is 'git' and the stderr contains the usage message related to 'git stash'.
3. The error occurs because the code tries to access the second element of the list returned by splitting the script (command.script.split()[1]), assuming it contains at least two elements. However, in this case, the script is just 'git', leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element that doesn't exist.
4. To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the list obtained from splitting the script has at least two elements before trying to access the element at index 1.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `split_script` list before accessing the element at index 1, we ensure that there are enough elements in the split script to avoid the `IndexError`.
