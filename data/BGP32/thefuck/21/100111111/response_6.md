## Analysis
- The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`.
- The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when provided with a `Command` object with `stderr` containing the usage instructions of `git stash`.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically stating that the list index is out of range.

## Issue
The issue lies in the assumption that `command.script` will always have more than one word, causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word in the list.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of `split_script` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
