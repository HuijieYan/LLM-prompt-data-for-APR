## Correction

The bug occurs because the `match` function is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` without performing a check on the length of the split list. When the script is only `'git'`, the split will have only one element, causing an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, a check should be added to ensure that there are at least two elements after splitting `command.script` before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the check `len(split_script) >= 2`, the function will avoid the `IndexError` by ensuring that there are at least two elements in the split list before trying to access the second element. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
