## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script starts with `"stash"` and if the word `"usage:"` is present in the stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` tries to evaluate if the `match` function returns `False` when given a Command object with inappropriate input values.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring at `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py` line 8, meaning that the script tries to access an index in a list that is out of range.

In the context of the failing test, the runtime input values show that the command script is `'git'` and the stderr contains the git stash usage information. The expected output is that the function should return `False` in this case.

## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the `split()` method called on `command.script` creates a list of only one element (`['git']`) in this specific input case. Hence, trying to access the index `1` directly leads to an `IndexError`.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if the split command has multiple parts before trying to access the element at an index. If the split command results in more than one part, we then proceed to check if the command script starts with `"stash"` and the stderr contains `"usage:"`.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This corrected version first checks if the `script_parts` list has more than one element before proceeding to check the conditions. This change ensures that the index is valid before trying to access it.
