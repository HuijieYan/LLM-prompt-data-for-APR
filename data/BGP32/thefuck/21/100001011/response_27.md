### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`. However, it is failing when the `command.script` is just `'git'` as there is only one word in it, causing the `command.script.split()[1]` to throw an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming there will always be a second word in `command.script`, leading to an `IndexError` when accessing an index that does not exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if there are enough words in `command.script` before trying to access the second word.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, we split the `command.script` into parts and then check if there are at least two parts before comparing the second part to `'stash'`. This modification ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` by checking the length of the split script before accessing specific indices.
