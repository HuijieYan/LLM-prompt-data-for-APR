### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the stderr contains "usage:". However, in the provided runtime values for Case 1, the command script is only "git", and there is a IndexError occurring when trying to access the second element in the list returned by `command.script.split()`. This is causing the bug and the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command actually returns enough words before trying to access the second word. If there are not enough words in the split result, we can return False immediately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there are enough words in the split script before accessing the second word. If there are not enough words, it will return False and avoid the IndexError.
