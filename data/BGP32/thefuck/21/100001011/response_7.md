### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is in `command.stderr` to determine a match. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` has no second word due to an empty string or non-existent index causing the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

### Bug Cause:
The `command.script` value being `'git'` causes the `command.script.split()` to return a list `['git']` with only one element. When trying to access the second element with index `1`, it throws an `IndexError` as the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the matching condition to check if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` and also 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. This way, we avoid relying on specific indices.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By making this change, the function will check for the presence of 'stash' in `command.script` and 'usage:' in `command.stderr` without relying on specific indices, effectively fixing the bug.
