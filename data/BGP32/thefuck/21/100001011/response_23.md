### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when `command.script` does not contain a second word, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. `command.script.split()[1]`: This code snippet could raise an `IndexError` if `command.script` does not contain multiple words.
2. `'usage:' in command.stderr`: This condition seems valid and should not cause an error.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to assuming that `command.script` always has multiple words. In the test scenario where `command.script` is `'git'`, it does not contain a second word, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. 

### Correction
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits `command.script` into words and then checks if there are more than one word in the list before accessing the second word. This modification prevents the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
