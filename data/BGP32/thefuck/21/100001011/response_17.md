### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to check if the `git stash` command is incorrectly used by checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr output. However, the bug arises when the function is called with a command script that is just 'git' without any arguments or subcommands. In this case, splitting the command script based on spaces and accessing the second word causes an `IndexError` due to the absence of a second word.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the command script does not contain additional arguments after 'git'. We can check if the command script contains two words or more before attempting to access the second word. Additionally, we can combine this check with the existing condition to ensure that we are still dealing with the 'git stash' command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script into words and check if there are at least two words. Then, we verify if the second word is 'stash' to identify the correct command. Finally, we ensure that 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr output. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub.
