### Identified issue:
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the `command.script` by space and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, in Case 1, the input `command.script` is `'git'`, which results in an IndexError because there is no second element after splitting by space.

### Bug cause:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that there will always be a second element after splitting `command.script` by space, leading to an IndexError when this assumption is not true.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` can be split before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split `command.script` by space into `script_parts`, then check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError. This modification ensures that the function does not attempt to access an index that is out of bounds.
