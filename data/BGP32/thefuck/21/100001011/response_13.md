The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr` to identify a match for the git stash command. However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, causing the `command.script.split()` to return a list with only one element, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second index.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` contains only `'git'` separately. We can modify the function to check if `command.script` is equal to `'git stash'` to correctly identify the git stash command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This version of the function first checks if there are more than one word in the `command.script` and if the second word is `'stash'`. If both conditions are met along with the presence of `'usage:'` in `command.stderr`, then it returns `True`, otherwise `False`.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and correctly identify the git stash command even when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.
