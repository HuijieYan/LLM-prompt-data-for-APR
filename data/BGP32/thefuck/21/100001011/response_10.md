The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, in some cases, the `command.script` might not have a second word, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before accessing the second index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring. This fix should address the reported GitHub issue related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`.
