### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the `command` is related to the git stash operation and if the `command.stderr` contains the string `'usage:'`. However, there is a bug where it directly attempts to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if there are more elements available.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are:
1. Accessing `split()[1]` without ensuring that `split()` does not result in an empty list.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the provided GitHub issue, the error `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs because the `command.script` split by whitespace results in only one element (as it is just `'git'`), and thus trying to access the second element causes an index out of range error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split `command.script` contains multiple elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the index out of range error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if there are more than 1 elements in `script_parts` before accessing the second element. This way, the bug causing the index out of range error is fixed.
