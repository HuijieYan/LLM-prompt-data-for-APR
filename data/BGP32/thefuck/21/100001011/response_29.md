### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the `match` function is splitting the `command.script` with a space character and attempting to access index 1 without verifying that there are at least two elements in the resulting list. This causes an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the `command.script` is just `'git'` without any additional arguments after it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if there are at least two elements in the split list before accessing index 1 to avoid the `IndexError`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the command is related to git stash while also checking for the presence of the correct usage message in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the resulting list has at least two elements, ensuring that index 1 can be safely accessed. If the second element in the list is 'stash' and the correct usage message is present in `command.stderr`, the function returns `True`, indicating a match.
