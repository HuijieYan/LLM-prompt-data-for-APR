### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` contains only one word, causing the `split()` method to return a list with only one element. When trying to access the second element of this list, an `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to assumptions made about the structure of `command.script`. When the `command.script` contains only one word, the attempt to access the second element of the resulting list from `split()` causes an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the list after splitting `command.script` is enough to access the second element before trying to access it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the script functions correctly.
