The buggy function `match` is currently checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. 

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, the issue arises when the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which causes the `command.script.split()` to result in a list with only one element. Therefore, trying to access `split()[1]` leads to an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1.

To fix this bug and make the function more robust, we should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function won't attempt to access an index that doesn't exist in the split script list.
