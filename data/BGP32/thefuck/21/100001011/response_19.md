## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. This is intended to match the case where a command is run with `'git stash'` and the output contains the usage information.

However, the bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description. In this case, when trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and accessing the second element, it results in an `IndexError` because there is only one word in the `command.script`.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to handle the scenario where `command.script` is not sufficient, which means it might not be possible to determine the exact command being run. In this case, the function should return `False`.

## Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function checks if the split `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If there are not enough words, the function immediately returns `False`. This avoids the `IndexError` when the command only contains `'git'`.
