The bug in the `match` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. The bug occurs when the command script contains only `'git'` without any additional arguments. The current implementation assumes that the second element exists and compares it to `'stash'`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the command script has more than one element before trying to access the second element and compare it to `'stash'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1
            and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the command script into parts and then checks if the number of parts is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This modification ensures that the function does not throw an `IndexError` when the script does not have additional arguments beyond `'git'`.
