## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is intended to match a specific command pattern in the stderr output when the command includes the word "stash." However, the current implementation is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`.

### Potential Error:
The buggy line `command.script.split()[1]` is causing the `IndexError` because splitting an empty string results in an array with no elements. Trying to access the second element in this case leads to an index out of range error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which does not have any elements to split into a list. Therefore, trying to access index 1 in an empty list results in an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function to handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain the word "stash." This modification will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the split result is empty.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The corrected version checks if the split `script_parts` list has more than one element before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` and correctly matches the desired condition.
