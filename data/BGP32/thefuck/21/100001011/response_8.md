### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, the `IndexError` occurs indicating that the split operation is failing due to the absence of the second word in the command script.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the split list without checking if it exists. In this case, when `command.script` is only `'git'`, there is no second element in the split list causing the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check that the split list contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the split list contains at least two elements before accessing the second element, the corrected version will prevent the `IndexError` and properly handle cases where the command script may not have the desired format.
