The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, it encounters an `IndexError: list index out of range` because splitting the script may result in an empty list if the script is not in the expected format.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the script is splitable and then perform the comparison. We should also include a check for the length of the split list to prevent the `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script into parts and then check if the length of the split list is greater than 1. If so, we proceed with the comparison to avoid the `IndexError`.
