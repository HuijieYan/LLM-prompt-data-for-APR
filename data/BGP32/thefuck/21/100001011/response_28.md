### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just 'git', causing an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1 in the split list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list from `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing index 1. We can also modify the condition to check if 'stash' is a part of the split list rather than at index 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

### Updated GitHub Issue Fix:
The corrected function will now handle cases where the `command.script` is just 'git', preventing the `IndexError` by checking if 'stash' is in the split list from `command.script`.
