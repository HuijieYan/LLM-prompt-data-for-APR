The buggy function is attempting to access the second element after splitting the command script by spaces without checking if there are at least two elements in the list. This causes an IndexError when trying to access an element that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command has at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By including a check for the length of the split command script list, we prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the comparison with 'stash' is only made when there is a valid second element in the split script.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding the git_fix_stash rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
