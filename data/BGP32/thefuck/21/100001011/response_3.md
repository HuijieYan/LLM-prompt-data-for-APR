### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'`. In the provided runtime values, the `command.script` is only `'git'`, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split. This leads to the failure of the `git_fix_stash` rule when the script is just `'git'`.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function assumes that there will always be at least two words in the `command.script`, which is not true in the case where `command.script` is only `'git'`. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list, leading to a failure.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split list is at least two before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly even when there is only one word in the `command.script`.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into words and then check if the length of the split list is at least two before comparing the second word with `'stash'`. This avoids the `IndexError` and ensures that the function behaves correctly.
