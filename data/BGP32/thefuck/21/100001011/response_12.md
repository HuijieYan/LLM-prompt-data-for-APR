The bug in the function `match()` is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when calling `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in the GitHub issue provided, the `command.script` only contains one element `'git'`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If not, we can return `False` to indicate that the input command does not match the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `match()` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

By checking the length of the split command script, we ensure that we avoid the `IndexError` when accessing index 1. This updated version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
