The bug in the `match` function comes from assuming that the script always contains at least two elements after splitting by white spaces (`command.script.split()[1]`). If the script is just `'git'`, as in the GitHub issue, the split operation will result in an empty list, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation results in the expected number of elements before trying to access the element at index 1.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first split the command script into parts by whitespace and store it in `script_parts`.
2. We then check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1, ensuring there are elements available to check for the keyword 'stash'.
3. If there are enough elements, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' keyword is present in the command's stderr.
4. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns `False`.

This correction should handle cases where the command script may not contain enough parts after splitting and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
