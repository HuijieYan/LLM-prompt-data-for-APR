## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` does not contain the word `'stash'`, leading to an `IndexError` due to accessing an element that does not exist in the split command script.

## Bug Cause:
In the provided GitHub issue, the command script is just `'git'`, which does not contain the word `'stash'`. In this case, trying to access the second element after splitting the script results in an `IndexError` because there is only one element in the split list.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second index. Additionally, we should also check if the word `'stash'` is present in the split command script. If both conditions are met, then we can check for the presence of `'usage:'` in the `command.stderr`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and store the words in a list. Then, we check if the list has at least two elements, the second element is `'stash'`, and `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. If all conditions are met, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
