The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` doesn't have a second word, causing `command.script.split()` to return a list with only one element. Then accessing the second element (index 1) of this list causes the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word. We can also simplify the check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version first splits `command.script` into words and checks if there are more than one word before comparing the second word to 'stash'. This change prevents the IndexError when `command.script` doesn't have a second word.
