The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the string `'usage:'` is present in the `command.stderr`. The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two words separated by whitespace, which is not the case in some scenarios, as shown in the provided GitHub issue.

To fix this issue, we need to first ensure that `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the second word might not exist in `command.script`.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first split the `command.script` into words using `split()` and store the result in `script_words`.
2. We check if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 to ensure there is a second word.
3. Then we check if the second word is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.

This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub problem where the list index is out of range when the `command.script` has fewer than two words.
