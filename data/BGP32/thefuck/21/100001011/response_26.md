The issue arises from the buggy function attempting to access the second element of the split command script but failing when the script contains only "git" without any additional parameters. This results in an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the split command script.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command script contains at least two elements before accessing index 1 to compare it with "stash". We can also simplify the check for 'usage:' in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if the split script command contains at least 2 parts before attempting to access index 1. This modification should prevent the IndexError from occurring and fix the reported issue on GitHub.
