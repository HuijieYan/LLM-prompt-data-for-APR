### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `match` function occurs when `command.script` does not contain at least two elements when split by whitespace, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access index `1`. This issue can be seen in the GitHub description provided, where the `command.script` value is `'git'`, which only contains one element after splitting. The function assumes that there will be at least two elements present, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script` contains at least two elements after splitting before trying to access index `1`. This can be done by modifying the `match` function to include a check for the length of the split command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the length of `splitted_script` is at least `2` before trying to access index `1`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` from occurring and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
