## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. The issue arises when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access `split()[1]` because there is only one word in the script.

## Bug Explanation
In the GitHub issue provided, it is clear that the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and there is no `'stash'` keyword present. The function `split()[1]` is causing the `IndexError` because the script has only one word. This bug triggers the `IndexError: list index out of range` because the function is expecting at least two words in the script.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add checks to ensure that there are enough words in the `command.script` before trying to access the second word. We should also correct the condition to check if `'stash'` is a part of the command and `'usage:'` is present in the error message.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we split the script into words, and then we check if `'stash'` is one of the words in the script. This way, we avoid the `IndexError` by ensuring that the script has enough words to proceed with the check.
