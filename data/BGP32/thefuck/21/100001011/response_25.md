### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr of the command contains 'usage:'. 
- The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have the expected format causing `command.script.split()` to return a list with fewer elements than expected, leading to a `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the `command.script` is split properly before trying to access specific indices.
- We should also check if the split list has enough elements before attempting to access them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We first split the `command.script` into parts.
2. We then check if the length of the split parts is greater than 1.
3. Next, we verify if the second part of the split script is 'stash'.
4. Finally, we check if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`.

This corrected version should handle the cases where the command script does not have the expected format and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
