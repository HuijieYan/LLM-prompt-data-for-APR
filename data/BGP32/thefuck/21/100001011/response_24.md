The bug in the provided function is due to accessing the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when the script does not contain multiple elements. To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the command script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the split command script has enough elements before accessing the second element. If it does not have enough elements, we should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1 
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash' 
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This corrected version checks if the split command script has more than one element before accessing the second element. This change should resolve the IndexError issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
