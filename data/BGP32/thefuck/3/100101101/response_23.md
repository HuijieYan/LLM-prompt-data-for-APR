The issue in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The expected command to obtain the Fish shell version is 'fish --version', but the current implementation uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This mismatch is leading to incorrect output and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug:
- Update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly extract the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
