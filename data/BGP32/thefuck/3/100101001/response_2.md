### Identified Issues:
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish version is `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting the command to be `'fish --version'`. This inconsistency is causing the test to fail.
2. The parsing of the version information from the command output is incorrect, leading to the version string being extracted incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation:
The `info` function in the buggy code snippet is executing `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to extract the Fish version. However, the test is expecting the command `'fish --version'` to be executed. Due to this discrepancy, the function is not retrieving the correct version information, leading to a failing test. Additionally, the method of extracting the version string from the command output is incorrect, resulting in an erroneous version.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in Popen to `'fish --version'` to align with the test expectation.
2. Modify the parsing logic to correctly extract the version string from the command output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The command executed by Popen is changed to `'fish --version'`.
- Extracting the version is improved by splitting the version string at the comma and retrieving the second part. This assumes that the version format remains consistent. 
- The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
