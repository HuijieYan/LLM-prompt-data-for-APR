### Analysis
The buggy function tries to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the shell. However, in the failing test, the expected output is `fish, version 3.5.9\n`, which indicates that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not be returning the expected version number format.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The expected version number format is not matching the output produced by the command in the buggy function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to match the expected output format `fish, version x.x.x\n`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version of the function uses the `--version` flag with the command `fish` to retrieve the version information in the correct format. Then it extracts the version number from the output and returns it as `Fish Shell x.x.x`.
