### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is attempting to get the Fish shell version by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using Popen.
2. The test is setting up the `Popen` mock object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `stdout.read()` is called.
3. The function is then trying to decode the output and use it to format the shell information string.

### Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the command being executed by Popen. The command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not provide the Fish shell version directly, hence causing the function to return incorrect information.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the command executed by Popen should be changed to `'fish', '--version'` to directly get the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
