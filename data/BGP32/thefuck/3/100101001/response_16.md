### Analyzing the issue:
1. The function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting `fish --version` instead.
2. The expected output from the command is `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which doesn't align with the output processing in the buggy function.
3. The function is reading the output of the `proc` process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, but it is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just the version number `'3.5.9'`.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version and adjust the way we extract and format the version number.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split()[-1]  # Extracting just the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']` and updating the way we extract the version number from the output, the function should now return the correct version information.
