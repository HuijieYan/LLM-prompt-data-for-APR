## Explanation:
The buggy function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to fetch the version of the Fish shell. However, the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`. This mismatch in the command being executed results in the function returning an incorrect version of the Fish shell.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed in the Popen call to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly return the version of the Fish shell based on the expected command in the failing test.
