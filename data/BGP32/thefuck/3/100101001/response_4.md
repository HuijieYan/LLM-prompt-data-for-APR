The bug in the `info` function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version, which is incorrect. The function is trying to capture the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting it to run `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to run `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and match the expectations in the failing test.
