### Analysis
- The error message shows that the `assert` statement in the test is failing because the actual output from the `shell.info()` function includes the string "fish, version" along with the version number, while the expected output should only be "Fish Shell" followed by the version number.
- The bug is due to the incorrect formatting of the output string in the `info()` function.
- The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns the full line read from the standard output of the process, including the unwanted "fish, version" prefix.
- The expected output should only be "Fish Shell" followed by the version number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. We should extract only the version number without the "fish, version" prefix and then properly format the output string.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extract version number without the prefix
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The above corrected version of the function properly extracts only the version number from the output and formats the output string as expected.
