### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly decoding the output from the `Popen` process before extracting the version. The output is currently being read as bytes and not decoded into a string. To fix this bug, we need to decode the output using the correct encoding before extracting the version.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function properly decodes the output from the `Popen` process and extracts the version. It should now return the expected output and pass the failing test.
