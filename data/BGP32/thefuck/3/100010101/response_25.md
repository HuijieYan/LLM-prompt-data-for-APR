### Analysis
1. The error message indicates that the output of the `shell.info()` function is not as expected.
2. The test is mocking the `stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` which causes the returned `version` to have the incorrect format.
3. The `info` function is not handling the output format of the command properly, resulting in the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `version` extracted from the output of the command is formatted correctly.
5. We need to strip the unnecessary characters from the output and format it as desired before returning.

### Bug Fix
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].split('version')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By parsing the `output` correctly to extract only the version number, we ensure that the returned `version` aligns with the expected output. This fix should pass the failing test case.
