### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command. The issue described on GitHub indicates that using `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop, which could be related to the implementation of the `info` function.

### Error Locations:
1. The subprocess command that retrieves the Fish shell version may be causing the recursive loop.
2. The way the version is extracted and formatted could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the recursive loop triggered when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses `thefuck -v`, leading to the `info` function in the `Fish` class being called repeatedly without properly handling it. This recursive loop may be due to the subprocess command `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'])` behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version retrieval process does not lead to a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. Consider fetching the Fish shell version in a way that doesn't trigger unintended behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version due to error: {}'.format(e)
```

In the corrected version, I've used `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output of the subprocess command, handled any potential exceptions that may occur during the version retrieval process, and returned an error message in case of failure. This approach should prevent the recursive loop issue when `thefuck -v` is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
