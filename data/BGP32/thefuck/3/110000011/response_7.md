## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that using the `thefuck -v` command, which calls the `info` function, leads to a recursive loop and hangs the Fish Shell initialization in the presence of the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function calling itself in a recursive loop as reported in the GitHub issue.
2. Inadequate handling of the `thefuck -v` command triggering the `info` function and causing a loop.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `info` function in the `Fish` class creating a subprocess to retrieve the Fish shell version. When the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses `thefuck -v` to regenerate functions, it triggers a call to the `info` function, leading to a recursive loop due to incorrect command handling.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to prevent the `info` function from being called in a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` command is executed. This can be achieved by checking if the command is specifically `thefuck -v`, and in that case, return a predefined response without executing the subprocess.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

        @cache('version')
        def get_version(self):
            """Return current Fish shell version"""
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return version if version else 'unknown'

        def info(self):
            """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
            if 'thefuck -v' in os.environ.get('TF_ALIAS'):
                return u'Fish Shell version'
            else:
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(self.get_version())
```

In the corrected version, I added a new method `get_version` to handle retrieving the Fish shell version separately and included a conditional check in the `info` method to handle the case when the command is `thefuck -v`. If the command is `thefuck -v`, it directly returns a predefined response without invoking the subprocess to avoid the recursive loop issue.
