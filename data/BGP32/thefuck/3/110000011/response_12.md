## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file in `thefuck` repository is causing a recursive loop when used with the `-v` option in Oh-My-Fish plugin. The function is attempting to get the Fish shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, it is likely that the recursive loop is triggered due to the way this command is executed.

## Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the way the `proc.stdout.read()` method is being used after executing the `Popen` command. This may be causing the function to hang or result in a recursive loop.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the output of the `Popen` command is being read. It is possible that the function is getting stuck in an infinite loop while trying to read the output of the `Popen` command, leading to a recursive loop.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should modify the way we handle the output of the `Popen` command. We can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`. This method waits for the process to complete and returns a tuple `(stdout_data, stderr_data)`. By using this method, we can avoid potential blocking issues that may lead to a recursive loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to gather the stdout data and ignoring the stderr data, we can prevent the function from hanging or causing a recursive loop. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
