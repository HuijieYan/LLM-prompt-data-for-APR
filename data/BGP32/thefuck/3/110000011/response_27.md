## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command through a subprocess. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it leads to a recursive loop due to the way `Fish.info()` is implemented.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `Fish.info()` function where it is trying to retrieve the Fish Shell version by executing a command.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the recursive loop triggered by the interaction between the `thefuck -v` command and the `Fish.info()` function. The `thefuck -v` command eventually calls `Fish.info()` which again triggers the execution of the `thefish -v` command, resulting in an endless loop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Fish.info()` function in a way that it does not trigger a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used. One approach could be to avoid executing the `thefuck -v` command within the context of the `Fish.info()` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        return u'Fish Shell'
```

In this corrected version of the `Fish` class, the `info()` function simply returns a static string `'Fish Shell'` instead of trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell through a subprocess. This change avoids the recursion issue caused by the interaction between the `thefuck -v` command and the `Fish.info()` function.
