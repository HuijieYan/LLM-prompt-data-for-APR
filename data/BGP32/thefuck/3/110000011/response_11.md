### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, it seems that this function is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, specifically when the `thefuck -v` command is invoked.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the usage of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop due to the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved in the `info` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The problem lies in the fact that when `thefuck -v` is executed, it calls the `info` function in the `Fish` class, which then tries to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call. This creates a recursive loop, leading to the hang issue reported in the GitHub thread.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the way the version of the Fish shell is obtained in the `info` function. Instead of calling the `thefuck -v` command, we can directly extract the shell version without triggering any recursive loops.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        return u'Fish Shell'
```

This corrected version directly returns the name of the Fish shell without attempting to fetch the version through any subprocess call. This should prevent the recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
