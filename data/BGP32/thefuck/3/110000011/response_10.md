Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is in the line where the stdout is read using `proc.stdout.read()`. This can cause the function to hang if there is no end of file marker provided for the process output, which may be the reason for the reported issue.

Cause of the Bug:
The issue reported on GitHub suggests that using the `thefuck -v` command in Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()` function. This recursion may be caused by the way the `stdout` of the process is being read in the `Fish.info()` function, leading to a hang in the shell initialization process.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the process reading the output from the shell command does not hang indefinitely. This can be achieved by properly handling the process output to avoid any blocking behavior.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()  # Read the output of the process
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `proc.communicate()` method is used to read the output of the process, which ensures that the function does not hang while waiting for the output. This should resolve the reported issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin and `thefuck -v` command causing a recursive loop.
