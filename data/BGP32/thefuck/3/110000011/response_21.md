## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command and capturing the output. However, the issue is that when the `thefuck -v` command is used with Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the version is being fetched.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The usage of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop.
2. Retrieving the version directly from the shell environment variable `$FISH_VERSION`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `info` function in the `Fish` class directly executes the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to get the Fish shell version. When the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses `thefuck -v`, it triggers a recursive loop where the same version is fetched repeatedly, causing the issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we can modify the `info` function to directly read the version from the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable, rather than invoking a subprocess command. This will ensure that the version is fetched correctly without triggering any recursive loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `info` function retrieves the Fish shell version directly from the environment variable `FISH_VERSION` using `os.environ.get()`. This approach avoids the use of subprocess and resolves the issue related to triggering a recursive loop when using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
