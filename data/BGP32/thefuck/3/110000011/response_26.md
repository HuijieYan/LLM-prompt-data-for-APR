## Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. The function is meant to return the name and version of the Fish shell. However, the issue arises when the function calls `thefuck -v` which triggers a recursive loop due to the way version information is obtained.

## Identified Errors:
1. The `info` function triggers a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is called, causing a hang during the shell initialization.
2. The function reads the output of the `Popen` process without waiting for it to finish, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of information retrieval in the `info` function. When trying to obtain the Fish shell version using `Popen`, the function reads from the process's output directly without waiting for it to complete. This leads to a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is invoked.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `info` function should wait for the process to finish before attempting to read its output. Additionally, the function should be modified to avoid triggering the recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is called. Improvements should be made to ensure correct behavior and avoid hanging during shell initialization.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version of the `info` function, `communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to finish and read its output properly. This approach ensures that the function retrieves the correct version information without triggering a recursive loop. The bug causing the hang during shell initialization in Fish shell due to the `thefuck -v` command has been addressed in the corrected function.
