## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `info` method within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, Fish Shell in this case. However, the function uses `Popen` to execute a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, which can cause an issue and potentially lead to a recursive loop based on the information from the provided GitHub issue.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. Using `Popen` to execute a command without handling the output properly.
2. Reading and decoding the output from `Popen` without checking for errors or edge cases.
3. Lack of error handling in case of issues with the executed command.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `info` function tries to get the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but this can lead to a recursive loop or hanging when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This happens because the function is not handling the output and error scenarios properly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and prevent the recursive loop or hanging issue, we should modify the way we retrieve the Fish shell version. One approach could be to check if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is set differently in the Fish shell and avoid using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, proper error handling and output processing should be implemented to handle any unexpected behavior.

## Corrected version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function that addresses the bug:

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')
        if version:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return u'Fish Shell (version information not available)'
```

In this corrected version, we use `os.getenv()` to directly get the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable. If the variable is set, we return the version information. Otherwise, we return a message indicating that the version information is not available. This approach avoids potential issues with executing external commands and provides a more reliable way to retrieve the Fish shell version.
