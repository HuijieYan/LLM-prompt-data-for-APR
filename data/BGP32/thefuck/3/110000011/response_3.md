### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, it reads the standard output of the process before waiting for it to complete, potentially leading to issues such as hangs or incomplete data retrieval.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The function reads the standard output of the process immediately after starting it, which can cause synchronization issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the reported GitHub issue, it is mentioned that using the `-v` flag for `thefuck` triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `Fish.info()` function. This indicates that the `info` function is not handling the subprocess execution properly, resulting in unexpected behaviors like hangs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to complete and properly handle any exceptions that may arise during the execution. This can be achieved by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            return 'Failed to retrieve Fish shell version'
        
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By waiting for the process to complete using `communicate()` and checking the return code for potential errors, we ensure that the function retrieves the Fish shell version correctly without causing any hangs or recursive loops.
