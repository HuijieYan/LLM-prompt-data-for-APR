### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to run a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The issue described on GitHub indicates that the call to `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `Fish.info()` function.

### Error Locations:
1. The call to `thefuck -v` in the `Fish.info()` function seems to be causing the recursive loop issue.
2. It appears that the way the version of the Fish shell is fetched might not be compatible with the way `thefuck -v` is executed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the interaction between the way the Fish shell version is retrieved in the `Fish.info()` function and the `thefuck -v` command that triggers a recursive loop. This interaction causes a hang during Oh-My-Fish plugin initialization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that executing the `thefuck -v` command does not trigger a recursive loop or hang during initialization. It might involve changing the way the Fish shell version is retrieved or handling the execution of `thefuck -v` in a way that avoids the recursive loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            version = "Unknown"
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We have used `proc.communicate()[0]` instead of `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the process.
- Added exception handling to catch `subprocess.CalledProcessError` in case the command fails.
- This should prevent the recursive loop issue and ensure that the function returns the version of the Fish shell without causing a hang during Oh-My-Fish plugin initialization.
