## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command. However, this subprocess command might hang during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a recursive loop issue.

### Identified Error Location:
The potential error in this function lies in the way the subprocess command is executed and handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `Popen` subprocess call might not be completing properly, leading to a hang situation during the initialization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should handle the subprocess call more effectively, ensuring that it doesn't hang during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            output = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True)
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            return 'Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version'
```

In the corrected version, we are using `subprocess.check_output` to run the command and capture the output. We also added error handling in case the subprocess call fails. Additionally, `shell=True` is provided to pass the command through the shell which can help with environment variables like `$FISH_VERSION`.

This fix should prevent the hang issue during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
