### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class from the `fish.py` file is calling `thefuck -v` command which triggers a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This causes the Fish shell initialization to hang due to the recursive nature of the command invocation.

### Identified error locations:
1. The buggy function `info` calls `thefuck -v` which leads to a recursive loop.
2. Lack of handling the recursive nature of the command execution.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command being executed within the `info` function of the `Fish` class. This recursive behavior results in the Fish shell initialization hanging.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid triggering the recursive loop in the `info` function of the `Fish` class by either modifying the command being executed or adding handling to prevent the recursive behavior.

### Corrected version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        return u'Fish Shell'

    def run_thefuck_command(self):
        """Run the necessary command for thefuck plugin"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return version

# Thefix is to split the thefuck command execution into a separate function to provide better control
```

By separating the command execution into a dedicated function `run_thefuck_command`, we can have better control over its invocation and avoid the recursive loop issue. This corrected version ensures that the `info` function only returns the shell name without triggering any unwanted behavior.
