### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command. However, this implementation is causing a recursive loop and hanging the initialization process when the `thefuck -v` command is used, especially in conjunction with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The subprocess call in the `info()` function might be causing the recursive loop and hanging.
2. The usage of `Popen` without waiting for the process to complete properly might lead to the hanging behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when the `thefuck -v` command is used, the `Fish.info()` function is getting called repeatedly due to the subprocess call for fetching the Fish shell version. This recursive loop leads to hanging the initialization process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the shell version is retrieved to avoid the recursive loop. It is necessary to handle the subprocess execution correctly and prevent hanging behaviors during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the info() function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except:
        return 'Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version'
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate()[0]` instead of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` to properly wait for the subprocess to finish execution and retrieve the output.
- We added exception handling to catch any errors that might occur during the subprocess execution.
- If any error occurs during the process execution, the function will return a message indicating the failure.

This corrected version should prevent the recursive loop and hanging issue associated with the `Fish.info()` function in the `thefuck` shell integration with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
