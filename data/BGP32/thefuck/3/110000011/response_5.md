## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of `thefuck` project.
2. The function `info()` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command, but it may cause a recursive loop issue when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin's `thefuck -v` command.
3. The bug is likely causing a recursive loop because `info()` function of `Fish` class in `fish.py` file is called by the Oh-My-Fish plugin's `thefuck -v` command, resulting in an infinite loop.
   
## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To prevent the recursive loop issue, we should modify the `info()` function to not rely on the same method that triggers the loop. Additionally, we need to make sure the function returns the name and version of the Fish shell correctly without causing infinite recursion.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return 'Fish Shell (version unknown)'

        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We have modified the command to get the Fish shell version to simply `['fish', '-v']`.
- Added a try-except block to handle the case where the `fish` command is not found.
- Removed the direct usage of the environment variable that could trigger recursive loop issues.
- The corrected function should now return the name and version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.

By using this corrected version, we should be able to prevent the recursive loop issue reported in the GitHub issue.
