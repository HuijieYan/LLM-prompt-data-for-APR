### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. However, the GitHub issue points out that when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, it causes a recursive loop due to the use of `thefuck -v`. This recursive loop is triggered because the `info` function itself calls `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which leads to a hang.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the `info` function where it calls `Popen` to get the shell version.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function calling `echo $FISH_VERSION` internally when attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version. This internal call to `echo $FISH_VERSION` causes a recursive loop in conjunction with the use of Oh-My-Fish and the `thefuck` plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to find an alternative way to retrieve the Fish shell version that does not cause a recursive loop. One approach could be to directly query the Fish shell for its version using a different method that does not lead to a hang.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `info` function retrieves the Fish shell version by running `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which avoids the recursive loop issue pointed out in the GitHub bug report.
