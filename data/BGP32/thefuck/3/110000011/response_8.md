### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call. However, the implementation is incorrect and leads to a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a hang.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `info` function where the subprocess output is read in `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This can cause the process to hang indefinitely, leading to the recursive loop issue reported on GitHub.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not waiting for the `proc` subprocess to finish properly before trying to read its output. The hanging issue occurs because the subprocess is not properly managed, causing the recursive loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly wait for the subprocess to finish executing before trying to read its output. This can be achieved by using the `.communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to properly wait for the subprocess to finish, we avoid the hanging issue and resolve the recursive loop problem reported on GitHub.
