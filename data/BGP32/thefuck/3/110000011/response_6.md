## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the function is not properly handling the output from the process created by `Popen`, which can lead to issues with hanging or not completing properly.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The use of `proc.stdout.read()` without proper handling or checking.
- The handling of the command output and decoding.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug described in the GitHub issue is caused by the `info` function not properly handling the output from the process created by `Popen`. When executed with the `-v` option, it triggers a recursive loop because the function is not correctly parsing the output or managing the process communication.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output from the process is properly read and decoded before proceeding to use it in the return statement. Additionally, we should handle any errors that might occur during the process execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate(timeout=10)
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to get Fish Shell info: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version, we have:
- Added a `try-except` block to catch any potential errors during the process execution.
- Used `proc.communicate()` to properly handle the process output and potential timeouts.
- Decoded the output from the process before using it in the return statement.
- Returned an error message in case of any exceptions during the process execution.
