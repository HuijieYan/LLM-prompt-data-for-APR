## Analysis
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, this approach is causing a recursive loop when the command `thefuck -v` is used within Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, leading to a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the fact that executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` directly in the Fish shell to retrieve the version triggers the recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used. This recursive loop seems to be due to how the version is obtained using a command that connects back to the shell.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative way to retrieve the Fish shell's version that does not trigger recursive behavior when used within the TheFuck plugin. One approach could be to directly read the version information from a known Fish configuration file or environment variable.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        # Read the version from a known Fish configuration file or environment variable
        version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the Fish shell version is retrieved using `os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')`, which reads the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable directly without triggering the recursive loop. This change should resolve the hanging issue reported in the GitHub repository.
