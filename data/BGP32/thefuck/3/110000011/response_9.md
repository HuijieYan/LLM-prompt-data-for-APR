### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class from the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running a command. However, this function is causing an issue when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin due to a recursive loop.

### Potential error locations:
1. The code is not properly handling the `proc` subprocess and its output.
2. The `info` function might be causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `info` function trying to fetch the Fish Shell version in a way that triggers a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This recursive loop may result in hanging the Fish Shell initialization.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the Fish Shell version is retrieved in a manner that does not cause recursive loops.
2. We can potentially handle this by directly getting the version without triggering unintended side effects with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            if proc.returncode != 0:
                version = "Error retrieving version"
        except Exception as e:
            version = "Error retrieving version: " + str(e)
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Changes made in the corrected version:
1. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command has been replaced with `fish -v` to directly get the version.
2. Used `proc.communicate()[0]` to get the stdout data and handle potential errors using a try-except block.
3. Added error handling to provide a message in case there are issues retrieving the version.

By making these changes, the `info` function should now properly retrieve the Fish Shell version without causing a recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
