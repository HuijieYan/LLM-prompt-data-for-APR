## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. The bug is triggered when trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This bug causes a recursive loop in certain scenarios, as reported in the GitHub issue related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin, specifically `thefuck` utility.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function calls `Popen` to execute a command but fails to handle the process correctly, potentially causing issues with reading the output.
2. There might be an issue with how the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the way the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is being executed within the `info` function. This command might interact in a problematic way with certain configurations or plugins, as reported in the GitHub issue. Additionally, failing to properly handle the process created by `Popen` and read its output can result in unexpected behavior and potentially infinite loops.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, a safer approach for obtaining the Fish shell version should be used to avoid potential recursive loops. Additionally, proper handling of the process created by `Popen` is necessary to prevent issues with reading the output.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
            version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8')
        except Exception:
            return 'Fish Shell (unknown version)'
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version:
- The `--version` flag is used with the `fish` command to directly obtain the version of the Fish shell.
- Proper exception handling is added to catch any errors that might occur during the execution of the command.
- The output is read and decoded as UTF-8 to obtain the version information properly.
- If any exception occurs during the process, it returns 'Fish Shell (unknown version)' as the result.

This corrected version should address the issue reported with the `thefuck` utility and prevent the recursive loop caused by the original buggy function.
