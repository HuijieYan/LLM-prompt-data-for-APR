### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish Shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that when the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the version information is fetched in the `info` function.

### Error Location
The error lies in the `info` function where it executes `thefuck -v` to retrieve the Fish Shell version. This causes an infinite loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `info` function tries to retrieve the Fish Shell version using a command that causes a recursive loop, leading to hanging of the shell initialization process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the Fish Shell version is retrieved in the `info` function. Instead of using the `thefuck -v` command, we can directly access the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable to get the version information without triggering a recursive loop.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, we can avoid the recursive loop issue triggered by the original implementation.
