### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, capturing the output, and formatting it into a string with the shell name. However, the current implementation seems to have issues with handling the subprocess properly and reading the output.

### Error Locations
1. Reading the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()` may cause blocking issues or reading partial data.
2. Potential Unicode decoding issues with `decode('utf-8')`.
3. Returning the formatted string without error handling for subprocess execution.

### Bug Cause
The issue on GitHub indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to how the version information is retrieved in the `Fish.info` function. This could be related to the way subprocess output is read and not properly handled, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential hangs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use `communicate()` to properly read the output of the subprocess.
2. Handle decoding and encoding properly to avoid Unicode errors.
3. Implement error handling for subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Properly read the output
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()  # Decode the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version of the function uses `communicate()` to read the output of the subprocess, properly decodes it, handles Unicode decoding, and returns the formatted string. This should address the issues related to reading subprocess output and potential hangs.
