### Analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` tool is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the issue on GitHub states that running `thefuck -v` hangs due to a recursive loop caused by this function. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the version information is being captured, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error Location
The potential error lies in how the version information is read from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by reading the `stdout` of the `Popen` process incorrectly or ambiguously, resulting in unintended behavior or a recursive loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version information is read properly from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process and that it does not trigger any unintended effects like recursive loops.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    # Use the 'complete' command to avoid recursive loops
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'complete -C 0; echo $version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we're using the `complete -C 0; echo $version` command to retrieve the Fish shell version without triggering any recursive loops. Additionally, we're using `proc.communicate()[0]` to properly read the output of the `Popen` process, which should prevent any unforeseen issues. The corrected function should now address the bug and prevent the hanging behavior observed in the GitHub issue.
