The issue in the buggy function lies in the way it handles the subprocess Popen object and reads the output. The function is not closing the process properly which leads to hanging when trying to read the output. This behavior causes a recursive loop specifically in the context of the Oh-My-Fish plugin using TheFuck functionality.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess is properly closed after reading the output to avoid the hang. This can be done by using the `Popen.communicate()` method which waits for the command to finish and returns a tuple of stdout and stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction ensures that the subprocess is properly closed after getting the output, preventing the hang issue reported in the GitHub thread.
