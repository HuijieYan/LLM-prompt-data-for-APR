The issue arises from the function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish Shell along with its version number. However, the function is incorrectly implemented leading to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The bug occurs because the function `info` creates a subprocess using `Popen` to run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then tries to read the output from the process. However, it does not handle the communication with the subprocess correctly which results in the function hanging and causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure proper communication with the subprocess created by `Popen` and handle any errors that might occur during the process.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any errors that might occur during the subprocess execution
        return "Fish Shell version information is not available"
```

In the corrected version, we have used `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output from the subprocess and added a try-except block to handle any exceptions that might occur during the subprocess execution. This should prevent the function from hanging and causing recursive loops when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
