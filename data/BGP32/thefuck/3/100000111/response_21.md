### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is using the `Popen` function incorrectly to retrieve the version of Fish Shell. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that this incorrect usage causes a recursive loop when the plugin is used in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish, leading to performance issues.

### Error Location
The error lies in the way the `Popen` object is handling the command execution to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `Popen` object to read the output of the command. The incorrect usage results in a recursive loop, impacting the performance of the plugin in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code should properly handle the output of the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version by using `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object. This will ensure that the command's output is read correctly and prevent the recursive loop reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fixed version of the function to address the bug
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, the function now properly reads the output of the command using `proc.communicate()` method, preventing any potential recursive loop issues. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
