The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` package occurs because the process created by `Popen` is not being properly waited for, leading to hanging behavior.

The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the hanging behavior is observed when using the plugin in Oh-My-Fish due to a recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v`. This recursive loop is likely caused by the hanging behavior of the `info` function.

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before getting the output. This can be achieved by calling `proc.communicate()` after starting the process using `Popen`. This way, the process will finish execution before attempting to read the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the process spawned by `Popen` finishes execution before reading the output, resolving the hanging issue.
