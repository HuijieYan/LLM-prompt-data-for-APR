### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command. However, the way it reads the output from the command might be causing a hang in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The problematic area of the code is where it reads the output from the command using `proc.stdout.read()`. This blocking read operation might cause the hang.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the blocking read operation on `proc.stdout`, which might not return the expected output in some cases, leading to a hang during shell initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and prevent the potential hang during shell initialization, we can use `communicate()` method instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`. This method will correctly handle the I/O streams.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip() if stdout else 'Unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We use `communicate()` method to read the output from the process without causing potential blocking issues.
- We decode the output to a string and strip any unnecessary characters.
- If no output is received, we return `'Unknown'` as the version instead of hanging.

This corrected version should prevent the hang during shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
