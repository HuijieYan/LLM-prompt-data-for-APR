## Analysis
The buggy function `info(self)` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. It then reads the output of the command to extract the version. However, the issue arises because the `proc.stdout.read()` call is not handled correctly, leading to potential hangs in certain situations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the way the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` method is called. It can potentially lead to hanging due to improper handling of the subprocess output.

## Bug Explanation
The bug can cause the function to hang due to the way it reads the output of the subprocess. If the subprocess output is too large or if there is no end of the stream, the `proc.stdout.read()` method may wait indefinitely, resulting in a hang. This behavior triggers the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess output handling is done efficiently to prevent hangs. One approach could be to introduce a timeout for reading the output or use a non-blocking read method. Another approach is to wait for the subprocess to finish and then read the output all at once.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    try:
        outs, errs = proc.communicate(timeout=5)  # Use a timeout for reading
    except TimeoutExpired:
        proc.kill()
        outs, errs = proc.communicate()
    
    version = outs.decode('utf-8').strip() if outs else 'Unknown'  # Handle empty output
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate(timeout=5)` to read the output with a timeout of 5 seconds.
- If a timeout occurs, we kill the process and read the output again.
- We handle the case where the output is empty to avoid potential issues.
- Finally, we return the version within the expected format.
