## Analysis:
The issue is related to a recursive loop triggered by using the `thefuck -v` command in Oh-My-Fish with TheFuck plugin. The buggy `info` function in `shells/fish.py` for the `Fish` shell is causing this hang due to the way it retrieves the version of Fish shell.

## Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the way the `proc.stdout.read()` function is being called directly after the Popen command without waiting for the process to finish. This could lead to waiting indefinitely and causing a hang.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish executing before reading the output. This can be achieved by calling `proc.communicate()` after the Popen command to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding `proc.wait()` after the Popen command, we ensure that the process finishes before reading the output, fixing the recursive loop issue and preventing any hangs.
