The buggy function `info` in the `shells/fish.py` file of TheFuck plugin is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that this subprocess call triggers a recursive loop when using the `-v` flag with the `thefuck` command, preventing Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. 

The bug likely arises due to the use of `thefuck -v` triggering the function `info`, which in turn recursively calls itself due to the subprocess call within. To fix this issue, we need to refactor the `info` function to either avoid this recursive loop or handle it differently.

One possible strategy to fix this bug is to check whether the subprocess command is being called in the context of the `thefuck -v` case and avoid running it in that scenario. Instead, we can directly return a string with the shell name indicating the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the function `info`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if "-v" in sys.argv:
        return u'Fish Shell'
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version includes a check to see if the `-v` flag is present in the command line arguments before attempting to retrieve and return the Fish shell version. If the `-v` flag is detected, the function directly returns the string `'Fish Shell'` without performing the subprocess call, preventing the recursive loop issue.
