### Analysis
The buggy function `info(self)` in `fish.py` is attempting to get the Fish shell version by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`. It then reads the output of the process to retrieve the version. However, the issue stems from using `stdout.read()` directly on the `proc.stdout`, which can lead to hanging in certain cases as described in the GitHub issue. 

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the plugin to hang in certain cases where the `stdout.read()` method does not detect an end-of-file condition, resulting in an unresponsive behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is essential to read the output from the process in a way that accounts for situations where the end-of-file condition is not appropriately handled. Utilizing `.communicate` method of the `Popen` object is a better approach as it waits for the command to complete and returns a tuple of `(stdout_data, stderr_data)`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout_data, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout_data.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation of the Correction
In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to read the output of the process, ensuring that the function does not hang due to improper handling of the end-of-file condition. This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and ensures the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
