### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, there are issues with how the output from the subprocess `Popen` is handled. The function is expected to return a string in the format `Fish Shell {version}`.

### Identification of Bugs
1. The function reads the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, but this method of reading the output may lead to issues.
2. The function does not handle potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the current implementation arises from directly reading the output of the subprocess without considering potential errors or edge cases. This can lead to issues when trying to decode the byte output as UTF-8.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use `communicate()` instead of directly reading from the subprocess to ensure all data is captured and potential errors are handled properly.
2. Implement error handling to manage exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    
    try:
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        version = 'Unknown'

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The subprocess output is read using `proc.communicate()` to ensure complete data capture.
- Error handling with `try-except` is implemented to manage potential Unicode decoding errors.
- If a decoding error occurs, the version is set to `'Unknown'`.

This corrected version should address the issues in the original function and provide a more robust solution that handles potential errors during subprocess execution.
