The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through the subprocess module. However, the implementation seems incorrect as it does not handle the subprocess correctly, leading to potential issues such as hanging the initialization process, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug:
1. The Popen call is made to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it does not wait for the process to finish before trying to read from the stdout. This can lead to the function hanging if the process is not completed instantly.
2. The function is not handling potential errors that might occur during the subprocess execution.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `communicate()` method of the `subprocess.Popen` object to wait for the process to complete and fetch the output.
2. Add error handling to catch exceptions that might occur during the process execution.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error retrieving version: {}".format(str(e))
```

This corrected version ensures that the function waits for the subprocess to finish and handles any exceptions that may arise during the process execution.
