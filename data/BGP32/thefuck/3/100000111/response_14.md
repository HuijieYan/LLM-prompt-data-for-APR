## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). It uses `Popen` to execute a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and read the output to get the version. However, the issue arises when the function is called recursively due to the usage of `thefuck -v` in specific scenarios.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that the function `info` is called recursively when `thefuck -v` command is being executed, leading to a loop. This is due to the fact that when `thefuck -v` command is executed, it internally calls the `info` function of the same class, causing the loop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to refactor the `info` function to handle the scenario where `thefuck -v` is being executed. We can check if the command being executed is `thefuck -v` and handle it appropriately to prevent recursion.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    if 'thefuck -v' not in version:
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return u'Fish Shell'
```

In the corrected version of the function, we check if the version string contains 'thefuck -v'. If it does, we return a generic 'Fish Shell' string to prevent recursion. Otherwise, we return the actual version of the Fish Shell.
