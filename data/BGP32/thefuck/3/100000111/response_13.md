### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is trying to get the version of the Fish shell running by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the issue described on GitHub mentions that this causes a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Error Locations
1. The function is not handling the case where the `Popen` process might hang indefinitely.
2. The function is reading from the `stdout` without considering the process completion status.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from how the function interacts with the `Popen` process. In this case, when trying to retrieve the version using `proc.stdout.read()`, if the process hangs for any reason, it will block indefinitely, leading to potential issues and the observed recursive loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process is handled properly, possibly by waiting for the process to complete and checking for any errors. Additionally, reading from the process `stdout` should be done in a safer way to prevent potential blocking.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    finally:
        if hasattr(proc, 'terminate'):
            proc.terminate()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version above addresses the issues by using `proc.communicate()` to handle potential blocking of the process, and also includes a cleanup step to ensure the process is terminated properly.
