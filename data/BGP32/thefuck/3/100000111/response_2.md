### Analysis:
The bug is related to the `info` function in the `fish.py` file which is used to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. The issue arises when the `thefuck -v` command is used, causing a recursive loop due to the way the version is retrieved within the `info` function.

### Identified Issue:
1. The function is trying to read the output of the `Popen` process but does not wait for it to finish, potentially leading to an incomplete read.
2. The recursive loop is caused by the fact that `thefuck -v` triggers the `info` function, resulting in a loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use `wait()` on the `proc` object to ensure that the process is completed before reading its output.
2. Avoid the recursive loop by preventing the 'thefuck -v' command from triggering the `info` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if "-v" in sys.argv:
        return None
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding a check for `-v` in the command line arguments and returning `None`, we prevent the recursive loop caused by `thefuck -v`. Additionally, by waiting for the process to finish using `proc.wait()`, we ensure that the output is read correctly.
