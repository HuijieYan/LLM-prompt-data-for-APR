### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `proc.stdout.read()` directly without waiting for the process to complete might lead to issues.
2. The handling of encoding with `decode('utf-8')` could be problematic.
3. Lack of error handling for the process creation or output reading.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is reading from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to complete, leading to potential hangs in certain scenarios. Additionally, the decoding of the output using `decode('utf-8')` might not work as expected in all cases. This can result in a recursive loop causing issues as described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to complete before reading from `stdout`.
2. Handle potential encoding issues by using the `universal_newlines=True` parameter in `Popen` to receive output as text directly.
3. Implement error handling to catch any exceptions during the process creation or output reading.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, universal_newlines=True)
    
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete and read output
    if proc.returncode != 0:
        return "Unknown Fish Shell Version"
    
    version = stdout.strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By incorporating the suggested changes, the corrected function now handles process completion before reading output, ensures correct decoding with text output, and includes error handling. This version should address the bug and prevent potential hangs as reported in the GitHub issue.
