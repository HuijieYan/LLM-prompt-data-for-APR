The bug in the current function `info` is caused by attempting to read the stdout of the `Popen` process directly without waiting for its completion. This can lead to hanging the Fish Shell initialization process when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin for TheFuck.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to complete before reading its output. A common strategy to achieve this is by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to terminate and then returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, we ensure that the function waits for the `Popen` process to finish before reading and decoding its output. This will prevent the hanging issue described in the GitHub bug report.
