### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the bug likely occurs because the `Popen` process is not being properly handled, leading to a hang in certain scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Identified issue:
The issue seems to stem from not properly handling the subprocess created by `Popen` when executing the command to get the Fish shell version. This can lead to hanging behavior in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is likely caused by not closing the standard input/output pipes of the subprocess created by `Popen`. This can lead to a hang when trying to read from them indefinitely.
- Additionally, the use of `stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` can also cause issues if the process output is large or incomplete.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and prevent hanging behavior, we should properly handle the subprocess created by `Popen`. This involves waiting for the process to finish and closing the standard input/output pipes.

### Corrected code:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    if proc.returncode == 0:
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `proc.communicate()` to read the output and wait for the process to finish.
- Check the return code of the process to ensure it completed successfully.
- Decode the output and return the version if the process was successful, or a failure message otherwise.

This should address the hanging issue and provide a more robust handling of the subprocess.
