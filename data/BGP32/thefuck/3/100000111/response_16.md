### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell) by executing a command in the shell. However, the current implementation seems to have a bug where it could lead to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Identified Bug
The potential bug in the current implementation lies in the way the `Popen` process is handled. When the `thefuck -v` command is executed, it triggers the `info` function, which in turn tries to fetch the version of the Fish shell using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This leads to a recursive loop as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the way the function is fetching the Fish shell version. The recursive loop occurs when the `info` function is called within the context of determining whether to regenerate functions, leading to an infinite loop. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function implementation such that it avoids recursive calls when determining the version of the Fish shell. One possible solution could be to extract the Fish shell version outside of the `info` function, ensuring that it is not called repeatedly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = get_fish_version()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

@cache
def get_fish_version():
    """Function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

In this corrected version, I have separated the extraction of the Fish shell version into a separate function `get_fish_version()`. This function ensures that the version is fetched only once and cached using the `@cache` decorator. The `info()` function now calls `get_fish_version()` to retrieve the version without triggering any recursive loops.
