Based on the GitHub issue and the expected values, the bug originates from the way the ``info`` function in the ``fish.py`` file is obtaining the Fish shell version. The bug causes a recursive loop when the plugin attempts to regenerate functions, leading to a hang in the Fish shell initialization process.

The issue occurs because the ``Popen`` object ``proc`` is not properly handled before attempting to read from its output. This can result in unexpected behavior where the function gets stuck in a loop.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess is correctly handled and the output is properly read before further processing. One approach is to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output. This can be achieved by using the ``communicate`` method of the ``Popen`` object, which will ensure that the subprocess finishes before proceeding.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version properly waits for the subprocess to finish before reading its output, resolving the issue of a hang in the Fish shell initialization process during the generation of functions by the plugin.
