## Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in the Fish shell and then formatting the output.
- The error message indicates that the assertion fails because the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) does not match the actual output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
- The issue seems to be with how the version information is extracted from the output of the command.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by not correctly parsing the version information from the output of the command. Instead of just extracting the version number, the function is getting the entire line with additional text.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the command and then format it accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output on whitespace and taking the last element, we can ensure that only the version number is included in the resulting string.
