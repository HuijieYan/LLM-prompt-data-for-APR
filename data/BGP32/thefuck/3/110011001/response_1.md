### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the function is not correctly parsing the output and formatting the version string, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The test case is providing a simulated output of `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `Popen` is called. The function is then reading this output and trying to format it as `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`, which results in `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly parsing the version value from the output of the `Popen` call. It is including unnecessary text like `'fish, version'` in the version string.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to extract the actual version number from the output of the `Popen` call and format it correctly before returning the shell information.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
