### Analyzing the buggy function

The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the version of the Fish Shell being used. However, the test is failing because the expected output is not matching the actual output. 

By analyzing the error message and the runtime values of the variables, we can see that the version extracted from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is actually `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`. This causes a mismatch in the expected output of the function.

### Potential error locations

1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning more than just the version number, including the string `'fish, version'`.
2. The format string is expecting only the version number without any additional text.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the output of the command contains additional text that was not accounted for in the expected output string. This leads to a mismatch and causes the test to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This can be achieved by splitting the output and extracting the version number part before including it in the final output string.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(", version ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will extract only the version number from the output of the command and format it correctly in the final output string. This should make the function output the expected result and pass the failing test.
