### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to fetch the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call to run `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The error message and runtime values indicate that the function is not properly extracting the version from the subprocess output. The test is failing because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes unnecessary text.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the function not properly parsing the output of the subprocess call and including unnecessary text in the version string.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract just the version number from the subprocess output and format it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

This corrected version properly extracts only the version number from the subprocess output and formats it as 'Fish Shell <version>'.
