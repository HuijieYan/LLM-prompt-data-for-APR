### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `info` is part of the `Fish` class, responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell.
2. The function uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command in the Fish shell to retrieve the version.
3. The error message indicates that the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. The function reads the output of the `Popen` process, but it seems the extraction and formatting of the version information are causing the discrepancy.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the version extraction from the output of the `Popen` process.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract the version information from the output of the `Popen` process and format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x' before returning.

### Corrected Version of the `info` function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extracting the version number from the output
    version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()  

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now properly extract the version number from the output and return it in the format 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.
