### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in the shell. However, the error message shows that the version retrieved includes the text `'fish, version'` as part of the output, leading to a mismatch in the assertion. This indicates that the string processing to extract the version number is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The `info` function is not correctly extracting just the version number from the output of the command executed. The version variable includes additional text that needs to be removed to get only the version number.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the extraction of the version number to exclude the unnecessary text `'fish, version'`. We can achieve this by splitting the retrieved output and only keeping the last part, which should be the version number.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]`, we ensure that only the version number is extracted from the output.
