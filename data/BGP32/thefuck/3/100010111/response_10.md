## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` operation could be where the issue lies as it might not be reading the output correctly from the subprocess.
2. The `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` formatting could also be incorrect or not capturing the version number properly.

## Explain the cause of the bug

The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the function is not extracting the version number correctly from the shell command output.

The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` operation is likely not processing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly. It seems to be returning the entire output `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` instead of just the version number `'3.5.9'`.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the process of extracting and formatting the version number from the shell output. Specifically, we need to ensure that only the version number is extracted and any additional text is removed. This can be achieved by properly parsing the output and extracting the version number using the correct methods.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we added the `split(',')` method to extract the version number after splitting the output by a comma. This way, we can capture just the version '3.5.9' without any additional text.

This correction should resolve the issue and ensure that the function returns the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
