### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command. The issue arises from the fact that the output from the command includes additional text ("fish, version") which is not needed for the final output. This leads to a mismatch in the assertion of the test.

### Identified Error
The error lies in the line where we extract the version from the command output. The actual version needs to be extracted from the output by removing the extra text.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurred because the extracted version contained additional text ("fish, version") which was not expected in the final formatted output. This caused the assertion error in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version from the command output. The extraction should be done in a way that only the version number is included in the final output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract only the version number
    version = version_output.split(",")[1].strip() if "," in version_output else version_output
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function extracts only the version number from the command output, removing any additional text. This should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
