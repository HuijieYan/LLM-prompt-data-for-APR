## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the function is returning the version in an unexpected format, causing the assertion error in the test.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to reading the output from the Popen process and formatting it incorrectly before returning. The expected output value is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output value includes extra characters and is not formatted correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the version is extracted and formatted from the output of the `Popen` process.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Extract the version string correctly from the output of the `Popen` process.
2. Strip any extra characters from the version string.
3. Format the extracted version string correctly before returning it from the function.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]  # Extract version correctly
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

Now, the corrected function should properly format the version string extracted from the Popen output and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
