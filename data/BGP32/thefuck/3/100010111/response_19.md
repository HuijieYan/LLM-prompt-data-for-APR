### Analysis
The `info` function is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, the current implementation is not handling the output correctly, as it includes extra text ("fish, version") that needs to be removed to match the expected output. This discrepancy causes the test case to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not properly stripping the unnecessary text ("fish, version") from the output when retrieving the version of the Fish Shell. This extra text causes the actual output to differ from the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the extraction process of the version string from the output. Specifically, we should remove the text "fish, version" from the output before applying further processing. This will ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove unnecessary text
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing the unnecessary text "fish, version" from the output before returning the version, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values.
