### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. The error message indicates that the function is returning the incorrect version, leading to the assertion failure in the test.

The expected input parameter values for the mock objects are provided along with the expected values and types of variables before the function's return.

The related GitHub issue suggests that the plugin is causing a recursive loop due to the way the version is retrieved in the `info` function.

### Identifying potential error locations

The error likely lies in how the version output is processed when it is captured from the subprocess. There might be extra characters or formatting issues causing the mismatch in versions.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug arises from the way the version string is extracted from the output of the subprocess. It seems that the version extract does not clean the string properly, resulting in a version mismatch.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the version extracted from the subprocess output is cleaned up properly to match the expected format.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version adds `split(", ")[1]` to extract only the version number from the output. This modification ensures that only the version is returned without any additional characters.
