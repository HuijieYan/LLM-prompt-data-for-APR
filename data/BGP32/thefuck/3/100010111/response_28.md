### Analysis
The buggy function, `info`, is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, the bug causes the version string to include additional unwanted characters like 'fish, version'. This results in the assertion failure in the test case.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the version extraction to include unwanted characters due to incorrect parsing of the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command inside the function. This leads to the incorrect format of the version string, which fails the test case's assertion that expects just the version number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted from the output of the command. We should ensure that only the version number is returned without any additional unwanted characters.

### Corrected Function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the stripped output and retrieving the last part (assuming that the version number is the last part), we can ensure that only the version number is returned in the correct format. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
