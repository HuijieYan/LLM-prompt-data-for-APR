## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a subprocess command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then extracting the output to get the version number.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning the full output (`fish, version 3.5.9`) instead of just the version number (`3.5.9`).
3. The expected input for the function is the output of the subprocess command which is `fish, version 3.5.9\n`. The function should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
4. The bug is caused by not extracting only the version number from the output of the subprocess command.
5. To fix the bug, we need to extract the version number from the output before constructing the return string.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess command and construct the return string correctly.

## Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract only the version number from the output
    version_lines = version_output.splitlines()
    version = version_lines[0].split(", version ")[1]
    
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the function to extract the version number correctly from the output of the subprocess command, we ensure that the function returns the expected `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
