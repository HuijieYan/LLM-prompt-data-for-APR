### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the issue lies in how the version is extracted and formatted. The error message shows that the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual version extracted from the command output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Error:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting and formatting the version information from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The command output includes additional text that needs to be removed before formatting the version correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly extract just the version number from the output.
2. Update the function to format the version number correctly before returning the shell information.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the command on `', version '`, we can extract just the version number and format it correctly before returning it as the shell information. This corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
