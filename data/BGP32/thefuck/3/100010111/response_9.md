### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, when reading the stdout of the subprocess, the function is not decoding the bytes output properly, resulting in the version being displayed incorrectly.

The error message shows that the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the function returns `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, indicating a formatting issue caused by the incorrect decoding of the output.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding of the output read from the subprocess. By not properly decoding the bytes output, the version string includes unwanted characters leading to the incorrect comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly decode the bytes output from the subprocess before formatting it into the desired output. By decoding the bytes using the utf-8 encoding, we can get the clean version string without unexpected characters.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().strip().decode('utf-8')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly decode the output from the subprocess as utf-8 before formatting it into the correct version string. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
