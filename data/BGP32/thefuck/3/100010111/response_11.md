### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is using `Popen` to run a command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the issue lies in the way the version is extracted from the output. The current function is extracting "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9". This discrepancy is causing the assertion error in the test case.

### Bug Cause
The function is extracting the version string from the output of the command incorrectly, leading to an extra "fish, version" prefix in the version string. This extra prefix is causing the assertion error in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly extract the version string by removing the extra "fish, version" prefix. This can be achieved by splitting the output of the command and extracting only the version part.

### Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()  # Extract only the version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version of the function will properly extract the version from the output of the command and return it in the expected format.
