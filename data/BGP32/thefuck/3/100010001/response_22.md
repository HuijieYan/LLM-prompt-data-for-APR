### Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to read the output of the `fish` command to obtain the version of the shell, and then formats it into a string following a specific format. The error message indicates that the format string for the version number is incorrect, resulting in a failing assertion.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line where the function is processing the output of the `fish` command to extract the version number, and subsequently formatting it.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises from how the version number is extracted and formatted. The string extracted from the command output includes both the string "fish, version" and the actual version number. The formatting in the return statement is just appending the extracted version number without removing the unnecessary text.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish` command and properly format it into the required output string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if ', version' in version:
        version_number = version.split(', version')[-1].strip()
    else:
        version_number = version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

The corrected version of the function above reads the version extracted from the `fish` command output and trims the unnecessary text to obtain only the version number. This version number is then properly formatted into the required output string, resolving the bug. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
