1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the error message:
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically the Fish shell. The error message shows that when the function is called, it returns 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This mismatch causes the test to fail.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error might be related to how the version from the subprocess is extracted and formatted before being added to the string.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the corresponding error message:
The bug occurs because the string extracted from the subprocess is not being effectively cleaned. It includes the word 'fish' before the version number which results in the mismatch when comparing the expected output.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the subprocess response. We should only extract the version number part and omit the 'fish' before it.

5. Providing a corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number without 'fish'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By adding the `split(',')[1].strip()` to extract only the version number part from the response, the corrected function should now properly format the shell information without including 'fish' in the output.
