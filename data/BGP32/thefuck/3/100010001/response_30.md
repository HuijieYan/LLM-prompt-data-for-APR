### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected output from the `info` function does not match the actual output due to an extra unexpected prefix (`fish, version`) in the string. This unexpected prefix is causing the assertion to fail.

### Potential Error Location:
The likely cause of the error is in the processing of the command output from the `Popen` subprocess. The `.strip()` method removes leading and trailing spaces but does not eliminate the extra prefix.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by how the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is processed. The output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` is directly converted to a string without properly cleaning it up, resulting in the extra 'fish, version' prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to clean up the command output properly by removing the 'fish, version ' prefix before formatting it into the desired string.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    if 'fish, version ' in output:
        version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')
    else:
        version = output
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We read the output of the command into a variable called `output`.
2. If the output contains the unwanted prefix 'fish, version ', we remove it using `replace()`.
3. We then format the purified `version` into the desired output string 'Fish Shell {version}'.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly process the output and provide the correct version string for the Fish shell.
