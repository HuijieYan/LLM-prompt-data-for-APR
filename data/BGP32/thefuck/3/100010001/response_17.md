## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function `info` is returning a string in the format `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the expected format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This indicates that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is returning the version string as `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` including unwanted text.

## Error Locations
The potential error location is in how the version string is extracted from the process output.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is returning the version string along with some additional text (`'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`). This extra text is not desired and causing the mismatch in the expected output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should remove the extra text (`'fish, version '`) before formatting and returning the version string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    # Read the output of the process and decode it
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Remove the unwanted text before returning
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version variable and extracting the last element after splitting based on the space character, we ensure that only the version number remains in the output. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
