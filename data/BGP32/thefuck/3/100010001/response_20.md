1. Analyzing the buggy function:
- The `info` function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using subprocess `Popen`.
- The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is supposed to print the Fish shell version.
- The error message indicates that the expected output is "`Fish Shell 3.5.9`," but the actual output has an unwanted extra string "`fish, version`" before the version number.

2. Potential Error Locations:
- The issue might be related to how the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being read and processed in the Python code.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is outputting the version text followed by a comma and extra text, like "`fish, version 3.5.9`."
- The buggy function is capturing the whole string but needs to extract and format only the version number part.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the code to parse the output of the command more effectively and extract only the version number part without the extra text.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string using the comma (`,`) and selecting the part after the comma (index 1), we can extract and return only the version number without the extra text. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
