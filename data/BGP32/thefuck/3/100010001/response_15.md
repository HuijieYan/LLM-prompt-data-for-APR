### Analysis:
The error message indicates an AssertionError when comparing the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) with the actual output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`). This suggests that the `info` function is not correctly extracting and formatting the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in the Fish shell.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect decoding of the output.
2. Incorrect formatting of the output string.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding of the byte output from the `proc.stdout.read()` function. The function `decode('utf-8')` was used directly on the byte output, which resulted in the string `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. This is the cause of the mismatch between the expected output and the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, you should correctly decode the byte output from `proc.stdout.read()` using the `decode('utf-8')` method after stripping any unnecessary characters. You should then format the output string with the correct version number extracted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the extracted version number will be correctly decoded, stripped of any unnecessary characters, and formatted to match the expected output. This should resolve the bug and allow the test to pass successfully.
