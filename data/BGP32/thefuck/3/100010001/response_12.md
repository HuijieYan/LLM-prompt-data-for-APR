### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to fetch the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` should return the version number, but currently, it is returning the output with additional text that is not expected.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be within the way the version output is read from the subprocess and stripped. It looks like the version output includes extra text ("fish, version ") that needs to be removed before formatting.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the output obtained from the subprocess. Instead of just the version number, the output includes unnecessary text ("fish, version ") which is causing the assertion error in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the way the version information is read to extract only the version number.
2. Ensure that the extracted version number is used for formatting the return string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_with_tag = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_with_tag.split(", version ")[1]  # Extracting just the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we extract just the version number from the output received from the subprocess. This extracted version number is then used for formatting the return string.
