### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the expected output of the `shell.info()` function is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the bug lies in how the version information is being retrieved from the shell process.

### Identified Issue:
The issue is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line reads the output of the process and directly decodes it assuming it starts with `'Fish Shell'` followed by the version number. However, in this case, the output contains additional text `'fish, version'` which causes the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the line where the version information is retrieved from the shell process to extract only the version number from the output.
2. Strip any additional text or whitespace to ensure only the version number is considered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[len('fish, version '):]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the slice `[len('fish, version '):]`, we can extract only the version number from the shell output and ensure that it matches the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
