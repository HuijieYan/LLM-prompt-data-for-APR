### Analysis:
The error message indicates an assertion error that the expected output is not matching the actual output. The `info` function is supposed to extract the version information of Fish Shell and return it in the format 'Fish Shell x.x.x'. However, the function is returning the version information along with some extra text 'Fish Shell' at the beginning.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with how the version information is being formatted and returned in the `info` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the `version` variable in the `info` function. Instead of simply extracting the version number, the function is returning the entire output 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the way the version information is extracted and formatted.
2. Trim the extra text 'Fish Shell' from the beginning of the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version extracts only the version number part from the output and formats it correctly as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'. This should fix the bug and make the test pass successfully.
