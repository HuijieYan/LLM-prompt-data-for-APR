### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the `info` function is returning an unexpected value due to an assertion error.
- The test is setting up a mock `Popen` object to mock subprocess behavior, and the `Popen` object's `stdout.read` behavior is returning a version string with extra characters.
- The issue arises from reading the stdout twice: once for setting up behavior and once for retrieving the version.

### Bug:
- The buggy function reads the stdout of the `Popen` process twice, which leads to an unexpected version string containing the process information rather than just the version.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to store the version string after the first read call during setup, then return that stored version instead of reading from the stdout during actual function execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extracting the version from string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version safely extracts the version number from the string read during the setup, ensuring the return value only consists of the version number without any additional information. This fix should make the function behave correctly and pass the test.
