### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is returning the version of Fish shell in an incorrect format. The test is failing because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the line where the version is being extracted from the command output:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
It looks like the command output is not processed correctly to extract just the version number.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command output includes extra information like `'fish, version'` in addition to the version number. This causes the formatting issue in the return statement of the `info` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version information from the command output. We should only extract the version number itself, without any other unnecessary text.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split()[-1]  # Extract just the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying the fix to the `info` function by splitting the command output and extracting the version number correctly, the function should now return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected in the test case.
