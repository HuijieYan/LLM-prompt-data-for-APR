### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the expected version of the shell is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. The difference in the actual and expected outputs is due to the incorrect parsing of the version information from the Popen process output in the `info` function.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the way the version information is extracted from the Popen process output inside the `info` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reading the Popen output directly without waiting for the process to finish completely. Since the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` call is executed before the process completes, it reads only partial output or none at all, resulting in incorrect version information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish and then read the complete output. This can be achieved by adding a `proc.wait()` call before reading the output from the process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the `proc.wait()` call before reading the output, we ensure that the process completes and the full version information is read, resulting in the correct output. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
