### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `info` in the `Fish` class, attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
- The error message shows that the extracted version string appears to be inconsistent with the expected format.
- The error seems to be related to the way the version string is extracted and formatted before returning it.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. The method used to retrieve the version from the subprocess.
2. The formatting of the version string before returning.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the version extraction from the subprocess output is not correctly implemented. The extracted version includes unnecessary text (`fish, version`) that is not needed in the final output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version is extracted from the subprocess output. We should only extract the version number ('3.5.9') and exclude any additional text. This way, the formatted output will match the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number
    version_number = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By modifying the version extraction to isolate the version number and adjusting the format accordingly, we can correct the bug in the `info` function.
