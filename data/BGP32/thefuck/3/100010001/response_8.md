## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in subprocess.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the output of the subprocess properly, leading to a version mismatch in the assertion.
3. The buggy function is reading the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, but it is not accounting for the format of the output which includes the string `'fish, version'`.
4. The fix should involve parsing the version information correctly and then formatting it into the desired output format.

## Proposed Fix:
Modify the process of extracting the version information to correctly handle the output format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this fix, the corrected function should properly extract and format the Fish shell version obtained from the subprocess. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
