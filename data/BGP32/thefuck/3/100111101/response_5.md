### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the current implementation is not correctly extracting the version number from the output string.

The failing test provides a sample output that the function is expected to return: 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The function should parse the version number from the command output, which in this case is 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

The error message indicates that the assertion fails because the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output includes extra text ('fish, version').

### Bug in the code
The bug lies in how the version number is extracted. The current implementation simply reads the output of the command and includes the entire string 'fish, version 3.5.9' as the version, leading to incorrect formatting in the return value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to extract only the version number from the output by removing unnecessary text and formatting the return value correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extract just the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

With this correction, the correct version number is extracted from the output and formatted correctly in the return value, passing the failing test case.
