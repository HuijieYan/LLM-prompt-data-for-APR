The issue in the buggy function arises from the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' does not output just the version number but includes additional information such as 'fish, version x.x.x'.

### Cause of the bug:
The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the buggy function results in the 'version' variable containing the additional text 'fish, version x.x.x' rather than just the version number itself. This causes the assertion in the test function to fail as it expects only the version number.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure that only the version number is extracted without any additional text.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to retrieve the Fish shell version to 'fish --version', we ensure that only the version number is extracted. Additionally, splitting the 'version' variable based on spaces and extracting the last element ensures that we only get the version number. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
