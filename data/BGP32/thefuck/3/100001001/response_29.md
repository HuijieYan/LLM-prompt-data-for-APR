### Analysis
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, it reads the stdout from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()` without handling potential issues related to the subprocess execution.

### Identified Issue
The issue lies in reading the output from the subprocess without waiting for the subprocess to finish executing. This can lead to the function trying to read from a process that has not yet terminated, resulting in incorrect or empty output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess execution to complete before reading its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method instead of directly reading from `stdout`. This method will wait for the process to finish before returning the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `communicate()` instead of `read()` directly, we ensure that the function waits for the subprocess to complete before reading its output. This should fix the bug and provide the correct version of the Fish shell.
