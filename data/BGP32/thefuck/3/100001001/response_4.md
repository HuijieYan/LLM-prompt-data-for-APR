### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function lies in how it handles reading the output from the subprocess. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is not returning the actual output from the subprocess but rather a MagicMock object, indicating that the reading process is not functioning correctly. This leads to `version` being incorrectly assigned a MagicMock object instead of the actual version string.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is not retrieving the output from the subprocess as expected. This could be due to a timing issue where the subprocess output is not fully available when attempting to read it.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it's essential to ensure that the subprocess output is read correctly before attempting to decode and use it. It may involve waiting for the subprocess to complete or ensuring that the output is available to be read.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the subprocess to finish
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(output)
``` 

In the corrected version, we added `proc.wait()` to ensure the subprocess finishes execution before reading its output. This should prevent the issue of reading a MagicMock object and correctly retrieve the version information.
