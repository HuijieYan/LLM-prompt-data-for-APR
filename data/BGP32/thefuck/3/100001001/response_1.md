### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function lies in the way it reads the output from the `Popen` process. The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns a `bytes` object, which is then decoded to a string using `decode('utf-8')`. However, in the provided buggy function, `proc.stdout.read()` is being mocked and returned as a `MagicMock` object instead of actual output data. This is likely causing the decoding process to fail and resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way we read and decode the output from the `Popen` process. We should ensure that the `proc.stdout.read()` method returns the actual output data in bytes format and then decode it to a string correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to read the actual output from the process and then decoding it to a string, we ensure that the correct version string is obtained and returned by the function.
