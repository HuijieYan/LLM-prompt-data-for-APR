The bug in the provided function lies in how it handles reading the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`. Based on the runtime values and types provided in Case 1, the `proc.stdout.read()` is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the subprocess.

The bug occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` is not being executed but returned as a MagicMock object instead. This happens because the `read` method is a MagicMock due to the way the Popen object is mocked in the tests.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to properly handle reading the output from the subprocess. We can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to retrieve the output. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    out, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we can correctly obtain the output of the subprocess, fixing the bug in the function.
