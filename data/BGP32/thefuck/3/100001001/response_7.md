### Analysis:
The issue in the buggy function lies in how it handles reading the output from the `Popen` process. The `proc.stdout.read()` call returns a `MagicMock` object instead of the actual output of the command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `stdout.read()` method returns a `MagicMock` object instead of the actual output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This happens when the `Popen` process is mocked in the test environment, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `stdout.read()` method retrieves the actual output of the command. We can achieve this by waiting for the process to finish and then capturing its output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` before reading the output, we ensure that the process completes execution before trying to retrieve the output. This should fix the bug and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
