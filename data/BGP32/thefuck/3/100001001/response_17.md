The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of the `proc.stdout.read()` method. The `read()` method is being called on the stdout, but it is missing the argument for the number of bytes to read. This results in an incomplete or incorrect reading of the output from the `Popen` process.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to read the output with a specified number of bytes to ensure the complete output is captured. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish before reading the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Adding the `proc.wait()` after the execution of the command ensures that the process is complete and available for reading. This step should be included before reading the output to prevent any incomplete readings.

Applying this correction should resolve the bug in the function.
