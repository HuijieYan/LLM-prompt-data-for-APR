### Explanation:
The issue in the buggy function lies in how it reads the output from the process created by `Popen`. The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns a `bytes` object, not a string. Therefore, trying to directly decode it to UTF-8 and strip it as a string in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` will cause a Unicode-related error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to decode the byte object to a string before stripping it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    decoded_output = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(decoded_output)
``` 

In this corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to read and communicate with the process, which returns both the standard output and standard error as byte objects. We decode the output to a string before stripping and returning it as the version of the Fish shell.
