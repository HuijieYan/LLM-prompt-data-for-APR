### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is trying to get the version of Fish shell by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` command through `Popen`. However, in the failing test, the expected output version is different from what the function is trying to fetch.
2. The test is setting a specific output for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read`, and then checking if the `info` function returns the expected string.
3. The error message shows an assertion error because the expected output does not match the actual output.
4. The bug seems to be in the way the version of Fish shell is being fetched inside the `info` function. The mismatch could be due to the incorrect command being used to fetch the version.
5. We need to update the command used to fetch the Fish shell version correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `info` function is due to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The test is setting the expected version as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is fetching the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This causes a mismatch in the string comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call within the `info` function to directly get the version of Fish shell using `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()
    version = version_str[2] if len(version_str) > 2 else ''
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version will fetch the version of Fish shell using `fish --version` and extract the version number from the output string to compare with the expected output in the failing test.
