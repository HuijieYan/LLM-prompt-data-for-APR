## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `shells/fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. It then reads the output of the process and formats it as `'Fish Shell {version}'`.
2. The failing test is expecting the version string `'3.5.9'` to be extracted from the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` and formatted as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The error occurs because the extracted version string contains extra text (`'fish, version '`) along with the actual version number.
4. The bug is causing the AssertionError in the failing test due to the incorrect format comparison of the version strings.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug is related to a recursive loop issue triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to extract only the version number part without any extra text.
2. Update the comparison in the test to match the correct format for the version string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'printf "%s" $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The corrected version modifies the command to use `printf` to only output the version number without any additional text. Then, it extracts only the version number part by splitting the received string at `", version "` and returns the proper formatted output.
