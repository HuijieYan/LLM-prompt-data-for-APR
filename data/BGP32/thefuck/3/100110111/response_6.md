### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the version information in a different format (`fish, version 3.5.9\n`). This is causing the assertion error.
2. The `Popen` call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but the test is looking for `['fish', '--version']`.
3. The error message clearly shows the mismatch between the expected and actual version strings.
4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to output the version in the format expected by the test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the format of the version string retrieved in the `info` function and the format expected by the test case. The function is returning a version string without the necessary transformation to match the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the command in the `Popen` call to use `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version format.
2. Transform the retrieved version string to match the expected format before returning it.

### Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    raw_version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = raw_version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the function will extract the version number in the required format, resolving the assertion error in the test case.
