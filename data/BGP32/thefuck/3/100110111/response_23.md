### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `shells/fish.py` file is meant to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by executing a command. However, in the test file `test_fish.py`, the expected version string does not match the actual output due to the incorrect command being executed in the function.

### Error Location
The main error lies in the command being executed within the `Popen` call (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) not matching the expected version string which is causing the assertion error in the test.

### Cause of the Bug
- The command being executed in the `info` function to get the Fish shell version does not match the expected format ('fish --version').
- Due to this mismatch, the version extracted from the wrongly executed command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the expected version, causing the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the command in the `Popen` call to `'fish', '--version'` to get the correct version information.
2. Decode the output of the `Popen` call correctly to obtain the version string.
3. Update the `return` statement to include the obtained version string in the desired format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now return the expected version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
