## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not be providing the desired output format.
2. The decoding method used for `stdout` might not be correct.
3. The version string extracted from the output might have extra characters that need to be removed.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect output format returned from the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The output includes additional text "fish, version" that is not expected. This discrepancy leads to the failed assertion in the test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the command to only retrieve the version number.
2. Adjust the decoding method to handle the correct output format.
3. Remove any unwanted characters from the extracted version number.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the changes above, the corrected function should now correctly extract and format the version number without any unwanted text. This will align the function output with the expected value in the failing test case.
