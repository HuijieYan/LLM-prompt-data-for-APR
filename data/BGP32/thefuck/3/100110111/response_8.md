## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. But the test is setting up the `Popen` mock to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `Popen(['fish', '--version'], ...)`. This discrepancy in the command being executed and the expected output causes the test to fail.
   
2. The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed in the `Popen` call within the `info` function to fetch the Fish shell version correctly. The correct command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8')
    version = output.strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the `info` function makes use of `['fish', '--version']` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version and process the output accordingly.
