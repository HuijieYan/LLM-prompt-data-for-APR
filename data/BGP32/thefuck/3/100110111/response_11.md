### Analyzing the buggy function

The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. However, in the provided failing test, the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while the actual output includes the unnecessary prefix `'Fish Shell'`. This discrepancy is causing the assertion error.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The command being executed to get the version might be incorrect.
2. The formatting of the output string in the return statement may include additional unnecessary characters.

### Explaining the bug

The bug occurs because the actual version retrieved includes the unnecessary `'fish, version '` prefix, resulting in the assertion error when compared to the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to extract the version information correctly and modify the return statement to format the output correctly without any unnecessary prefixes.

### Corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The command being executed is changed to `fish --version` to retrieve the version information correctly.
- The extracted version is then stripped of any unnecessary characters to obtain just the version number.
- The return statement formats the output as `'Fish Shell version_number'`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
