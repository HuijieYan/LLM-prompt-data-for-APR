### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` but is actually calling the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.
2. The failing test is expecting the version to be extracted from the output of `fish --version`.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output is `"Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9"` instead of `"Fish Shell 3.5.9"`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command executed by `Popen` to be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making this correction, the `info` function will correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell using `fish --version` as expected by the test.
