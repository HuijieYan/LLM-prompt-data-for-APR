### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `info()` in the `fish.py` file of the `fish` shell is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. However, the failing test is mocking the `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, whereas the function expects only the version number without the extra text. This discrepancy results in the failing test.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. Incorrect handling of the output from the `Popen` object.
2. Misinterpretation of the version number due to additional text in the output.

### Explanation of the bug

The failing test sets the `stdout.read` side effect to return 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', which includes additional text along with the version number. The function `info()` is expecting only the version number but is reading the entire output and then formatting it as `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`. This leads to the assertion failure during the test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to parse the version number correctly from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The code should extract and format only the version number without any additional text.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_lines = version_output.split(',')
    version = version_lines[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we split the version output by commas (`','`) to extract the version number only. This approach correctly handles scenarios where the output may contain additional text along with the version number. This change should make the function compatible with the provided failing test.
