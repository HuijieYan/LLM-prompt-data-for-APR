## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, Fish Shell. It uses a subprocess to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then retrieves the version output to form the return value.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mocked `Popen` object to simulate the output of `fish --version` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n`.
3. The failure occurs because the function is not processing the version value correctly; it is not filtering just the version number.
4. We need to modify the way the version is extracted from the output to match the expected format.
5. Additionally, the function should call `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to match the test setup and assertion.

## Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The function is not extracting only the version number correctly from the provided command output.
2. The command used in the subprocess call does not match the expected command in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the subprocess call to use `fish --version` command.
2. Extract and format the version number correctly from the output to match the expected format.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
