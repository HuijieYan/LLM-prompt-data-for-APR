## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell. However, the command being executed is incorrect for fetching the version of Fish shell.
2. The failing test for this function expects the output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the buggy function returns a different format including the version number and additional text.
3. The failing test captures the difference in the expected and actual output values, leading to an assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed in the `info` function to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The command should be changed from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` to retrieve the correct version information.
2. The output obtained from the modified command should then be processed to extract only the version number without any additional text.
3. By making this change, the `info` function should return the expected value and pass the failing test.

## Updated Corrected Function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_info.split(',')[1].strip().split(" ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the above corrected version of the `info` function, it should now correctly fetch and return the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, allowing it to pass the failing test successfully.
