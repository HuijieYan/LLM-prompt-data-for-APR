### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file retrieves the Fish shell version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock behavior for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when called.
3. The assertion error occurs because the function is not parsing the version correctly and formatting the output string.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the fix is related to the recursive loop triggered by the particular behavior of the `info` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly parse the version string from the output of the command and is not formatting the output string as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the function to correctly parse the version string and format the output string with the version number.
2. Ensure that the function handles the version string properly to prevent any recursive loop or incorrect output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
```

The corrected version correctly parses the version number from the output string, ensuring that it matches the expected format.
