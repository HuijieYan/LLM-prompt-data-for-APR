## Analysis
1. The `info` function in `fish.py` is supposed to return the version of the Fish Shell by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The function then formats this version information as `'Fish Shell version_number'`.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock `Popen` object to return the version `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This triggers an assertion error due to mismatched expected and actual values.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect assertion in the test compared to the formatting done in the `info` function. The expected output should have been formatted using `'Fish Shell version_number'` format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the format of the version information obtained from the shell command execution.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Updated `info` function:
- Splits the version string obtained from the shell command to extract only the version number.
- Formats the version number correctly as `'Fish Shell version_number'`.

Now, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test with the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` based on the provided test case.
