### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing its output.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock for `Popen` to return the version string, expecting the function to format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.
3. The error occurs due to the formatting of the version string which includes additional text. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output contains 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. The cause of the bug is the incorrect shell command used to retrieve the version and an incorrect formatting approach.
5. To fix the bug, the shell command needs to be modified, and the formatting of the version string should be corrected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the shell command in `Popen` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Modify the way the version string is formatted to match the expected output 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected function uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and extracts only the version number to format it correctly. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
