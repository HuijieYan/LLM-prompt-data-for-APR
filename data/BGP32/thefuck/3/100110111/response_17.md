### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in shells/fish.py uses Popen to run `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the current shell version. The test function `test_info` in test_fish.py sets up the stdout read side effect to return 'fish, version 3.5.9\n'. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
2. The cause of the bug is that the expected version string fetched from the command output includes unnecessary characters "fish, version" which is not handled in the buggy function.
3. The failing test is due to a mismatch between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual returned value with additional 'fish, version'. This results in the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the extraction of the version string by removing the extra characters and only considering the version number.
5. Providing a corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly extract and return only the version number, resolving the assertion error in the test.
