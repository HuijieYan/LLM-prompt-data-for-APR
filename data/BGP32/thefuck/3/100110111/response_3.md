### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command in the Fish shell.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock behavior for the subprocess `Popen` to return version information when called with specific arguments.
3. The assertion failure in the failing test indicates that the actual output of the `info` function doesn't match the expected output.
4. The discrepancy is due to the way the version information is extracted and formatted in the buggy function.
5. The related GitHub issue highlights a problem with the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` in Fish shell when using the plugin, indicating that the fix is addressing a similar issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `info` function is caused by incorrect parsing of the version information obtained from the subprocess call. It fails to properly extract and format the version string, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the version string is extracted correctly from the stdout of the subprocess call.
2. Verify that the version is parsed in the expected format before being combined with the shell name.
3. Update the format of the version string to match the expected output.
4. Adjust the subprocess call command to retrieve the version in a compatible way.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version:
- We update the command in the subprocess call to `['fish', '--version']` to match the output expected by the test.
- We correctly extract the version information by splitting the output at the comma and retrieving the second part.
- We format the version string using an f-string to match the expected format.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test with the expected output.
