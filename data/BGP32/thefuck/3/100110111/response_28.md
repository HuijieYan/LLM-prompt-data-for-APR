Based on the analysis, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in `fish.py` arises from reading the version output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in a Fish Shell context. The failing test expects the version string to be parsed correctly and formatted into `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`, but the parsing logic in the `info` function is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values.

The bug seems to be in the way the version is extracted from the command output and formatted for the return statement. The provided code reads the output directly without parsing the actual version number correctly, leading to a discrepancy when comparing the expected and actual values in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic to correctly parse the version number and then format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x' before returning from the `info` function. Additionally, the command executed by `Popen` should be changed to 'fish --version' to get the correct version string for parsing.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function in fish.py
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Parse the version from the output
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1].strip()

    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number from the command output, format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x', and return the expected string. This should resolve the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values.
