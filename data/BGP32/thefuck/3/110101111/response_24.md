### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the command used to get the version is `fish --version`, which leads to the incorrect value being read.
2. The `Popen` call seems to be using the wrong command to fetch the version, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, update the command in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` to fetch the version of the Fish shell correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `fish --version` and parsing the correct version info from the output, the corrected function should now return the expected version of the Fish shell. This change should also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
