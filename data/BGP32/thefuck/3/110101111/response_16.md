The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is due to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish version. The function is currently trying to retrieve the Fish version by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The updated function now correctly fetches the Fish version using `fish --version`, which aligns with the expected output in the failing test case. With this correction, the test case should pass successfully.
