## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is designed to return the name and version of the current shell by invoking the `fish` command with the `-c` flag to display the `FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test provides a mocked return value for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which should lead to the output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that invoking `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function, which implies that the current implementation of `info()` is causing unintended behavior.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect format of the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` used with `Popen`, leading to incorrect parsing of the version string.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` being used with `Popen` to retrieve the Fish shell version. This results in the output being different from what is expected, triggering a recursive loop as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, the command used with `Popen` should be updated to `'fish --version'` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version. This change should resolve the issue and ensure the correct version is extracted.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this fix, the `Fish.info()` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, resolving the bug and preventing the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.
