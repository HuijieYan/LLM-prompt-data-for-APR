The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is related to the command being run using Popen. The output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is different from the expected output of `fish --version`. This causes the test to fail as it expects the version number in a different format.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command being executed by Popen in the `info` function to fetch the version number in the correct format.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.communicate()[0]
        version = output.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']` we will get the version number in the correct format. Additionally, using `proc.communicate()[0]` we can fetch the output of the command directly. Then, we split the output based on `,` and extract the version number. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
