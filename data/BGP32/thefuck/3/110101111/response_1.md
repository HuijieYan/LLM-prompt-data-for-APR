The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is due to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not the correct way to fetch the version in Fish shell. 

To fix the bug, the command should be changed to `fish --version` in order to accurately retrieve the version information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `fish --version`, as expected. This change will address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
