Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect command executed using Popen. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is not correctly retrieving the version of the fish shell. This results in the test failing as the expected version does not match the actual version retrieved.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be changed to `fish --version` to ensure that the correct fish shell version is retrieved.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the fish shell version and pass the failing test. This fix should also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the recursive loop caused by the incorrect command execution.
