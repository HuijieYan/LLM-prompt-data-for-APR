Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file is caused by an incorrect command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. The test is expecting the command `fish --version`, but the function is executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will now execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and return it in the expected format. This change will allow the function to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command.
