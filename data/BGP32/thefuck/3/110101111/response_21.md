Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the expected values and types during the failing test execution, it is clear that the issue lies in how the version information is extracted from the `proc.stdout`. The version string contains extra characters like "fish, version" which need to be removed to match the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the class with the fixed buggy function
class Fish(Generic):    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix removes the unnecessary text "fish, version " from the version string extracted from `proc.stdout` before formatting it with the rest of the output string.

This correction should resolve the failing test case and align with the expected output values.
