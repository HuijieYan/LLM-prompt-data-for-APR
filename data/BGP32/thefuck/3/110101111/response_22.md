The bug in the provided function `info` is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. Additionally, the test is expecting the version string to be extracted from the output "fish, version 3.5.9\n" but it does not match the actual output that is being decoded and returned.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the command in `Popen` from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to ['fish', '--version'].
2. Update the expected version to be extracted from the correct output format '3.5.9' instead of 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

After making these changes, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish version and return it in the expected format. This will resolve the failing test case and address the issue mentioned on GitHub related to the recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Fish shell.
