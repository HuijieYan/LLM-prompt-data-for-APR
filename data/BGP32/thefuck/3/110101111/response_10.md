## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command using `Popen`. However, the expected output version string is different than what is being extracted from the process stdout.
   
2. The failing test is trying to assert that the version string extracted from the process matches the expected version string. It is also checking the command passed to `Popen`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the extracted version string includes extra text "fish, version" which needs to be stripped out. This discrepancy in the extracted version string is causing the test to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we should strip out the unwanted text "fish, version" from the extracted version string before formatting it as "Fish Shell {version}".

## Correction

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')`, we remove the unwanted text "fish, version" from the extracted version string before formatting it as expected. This correction should make the function return the correct version string and pass the failing test.
