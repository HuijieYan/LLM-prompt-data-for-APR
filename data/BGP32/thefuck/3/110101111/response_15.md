Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function is trying to get the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test expects the version to be retrieved with `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, the command used to get the Fish shell version should be updated to be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing the command to retrieve the Fish shell version with `['fish', '--version']`, the function will correctly return the version information as expected by the failing test.
