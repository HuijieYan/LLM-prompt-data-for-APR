Based on the runtime and expected values provided, the bug in the `info()` function of the `Fish` class stems from the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the Popen subprocess call. The subprocess command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` should be changed to `fish --version` to properly fetch the version information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the function will correctly retrieve and format the Fish shell version and pass the failing test case provided. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the hang-up during Fish Shell initialization using Oh-My-Fish with the TheFuck plugin.
