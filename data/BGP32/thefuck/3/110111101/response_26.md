### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell but is incorrectly retrieving the whole version string instead of just the version number.
2. The test case is asserting the whole expected output string (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) but the buggy function is returning the string with additional text (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
3. The error message indicates the mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `info` function.
4. The issue lies in the processing of the version string retrieved from the shell command output. The function should extract only the version number.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the retrieved string.

### Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """
        Returns the name and version of the current shell
        """
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_string = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_string.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The bug fix involves splitting the retrieved version string by ',' and taking the second part to get only the numeric version. This modification ensures that the function returns the expected version format ('Fish Shell x.x.x') and passes the test case.
