## Correction of the buggy function

Based on the analysis provided and the failing test, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is related to the incorrect handling of the `version` output from the subprocess call. The `version` output includes unnecessary text ('fish, version') which is not needed in the final output.

To address this issue, we need to modify how the `version` is extracted from the subprocess output and formatted in the return statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected class with the info function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By splitting the `version` string based on the comma and selecting the second part (assuming the version number follows the comma), we can extract the version number directly without unnecessary text. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.

Please ensure to test the corrected function to verify that it resolves the issue.
