### Fixing the Bug

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `info` function arises from the fact that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is used to retrieve the Fish shell version, but the actual output includes additional text like `fish, version` before the version number. This causes the assertion in the test to fail as it expects only the version number.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(", version ")[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With the corrected version of the `info` function above, the function will now extract only the version number from the output of the command and return it correctly. This change will ensure that the test passes with the expected output.
