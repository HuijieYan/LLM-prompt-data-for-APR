### Step 1: Analysis
The buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). However, the issue lies in the fact that the command passed to `Popen` is `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'`. This leads to an incorrect extraction of the version from the command output.

The failing test sets up the `Popen` mock to return the output `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which the function then processes incorrectly due to the mismatch in the command call and formatting.

### Step 2: Identifying the Bug
The bug is in the command passed to `Popen`, which should be `'fish --version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This results in incorrect version extraction and comparison leading to the failing test.

### Step 3: Understanding the Bug
The bug causes the function to extract the version incorrectly from the output of the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This results in the version containing extra information like `'fish, version'`, making the comparison fail because the expected version does not match.

### Step 4: Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, update the command passed to `Popen` to `'fish --version'` so that the shell version is correctly retrieved.

### Step 5: Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version without 'fish, version'
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

With the corrected version above, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected.
