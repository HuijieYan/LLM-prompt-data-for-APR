### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected version format is not being correctly parsed due to the incorrect command being executed.

The failing test provides an expected version format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current implementation retrieves `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` being executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This results in the version string being extracted in an incorrect format.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command executed by `Popen` to `'fish', '--version'` to get the correct version format. Then, we should parse and extract the version information correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the updated command `'fish', '--version'` will correctly return the version info in the desired format, and extracting the specific version string element from the output will result in the correct output.
