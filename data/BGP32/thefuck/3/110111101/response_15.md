### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the version of the current Fish shell. It is using the `Popen` function to run a command to get the version but comparing it directly without extracting the version number.
2. The test function `test_info(self, shell, Popen)` is setting the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return the version string 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', which the buggy function is reading but not extracting the version from correctly.
3. The failing test indicates an assertion error because the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' while the actual output is formatted as 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the function is not correctly processing and formatting the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version is extracted from the output of the `Popen` command and formatted.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `info(self)` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the extracted version string and taking the second part, we can get only the version number and format it properly before returning.
