### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
2. The failing test `test_info` is checking if the `info` function correctly formats the version string.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` in the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version within the `info` function.

### Bug:
The bug arises because the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used to retrieve the Fish shell version instead of `fish --version`, resulting in an incorrect output mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the command executed by `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the Fish shell version information correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making this change, the `info` function should be able to retrieve the version of the Fish shell correctly, resolving the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub report. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test as well.
