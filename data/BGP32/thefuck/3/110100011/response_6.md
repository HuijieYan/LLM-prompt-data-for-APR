## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the current implementation reads the output of the command incorrectly.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock `Popen` object to return a specific output when executed, but the buggy function's implementation does not align with the expected output format.
3. The failing test tries to assert that the returned value from `shell.info()` matches a specific format, which is failing due to the incorrect parsing of the version information. The issue in GitHub also confirms the problem with the `info` function in the Fish shell implementation of `thefuck`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to read the output of the command properly and format it correctly to match the expected output format in the test.


## Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object, we can properly read the output of the command executed and then format it into the desired string format. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the hanging Fish Shell initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
