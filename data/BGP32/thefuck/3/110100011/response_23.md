### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but is expecting the output of `fish --version`.
2. The failing test is mocking the subprocess `Popen` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which doesn't match with the expected output format in the `info` function.
3. The bug causes the test to fail because the expected version string `3.5.9` is not obtained from the subprocess call.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected output in the test case.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will correctly retrieve the version information of the Fish shell, aligning with the test case's expectations. This correction should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub page.
