## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`).
2. The test function detects the shell version by mocking the `Popen` object and setting the expected output.
3. The bug causes a recursive loop due to incorrect command being used in the `Popen` call.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by updating the command from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']` in the `Popen` call within the `info` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
