## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, but the issue is caused by the incorrect command used (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`).
2. The failing test `test_info` is asserting for the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the correct call to `Popen` with `['fish', '--version']`.
3. The bug is causing recursive loop due to incorrect command, which is mentioned in the GitHub issue. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is triggering the issue instead of `fish --version`, and recursive loop is happening when TheFuck plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the correct Fish shell version.
2. Refactor the `info` function to ensure it reads the version correctly using the updated command.
3. Modify the failing test `test_info` by updating the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the expected `Popen` call with `['fish', '--version']`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By making these changes, the bug causing the recursive loop will be fixed, and the corrected function is more aligned with the correct usage for fetching the Fish shell version.
