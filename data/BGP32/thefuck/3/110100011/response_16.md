## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. However, it is not correctly capturing the version due to incorrect command execution and parsing of the version string. The failing test is trying to verify if the correct version string is returned, but the buggy function is not handling the command output correctly.

## Error Locations
- The command used in `Popen` is incorrect. It should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
- The parsing of the version string from the stdout of the process is not correct. It should be using regex or splitting the output string to correctly extract the version.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the command being executed in `Popen` does not fetch the version of Fish shell correctly, leading to incorrect version information being returned. This causes the failing test to not pass as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed in `Popen` to `'fish --version'` to correctly fetch the version information. Additionally, we need to parse the output of the command to extract the version number accurately before returning it in the desired format.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(", version ")[1].rstrip("\n")
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the `info()` function, it should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version by executing `'fish --version'` and parsing the output to extract the version number, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
