## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to incorrect output and failing tests.
3. The failing test is checking if the version returned by the `info` function matches the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and if the command used to retrieve the version is correct, which is not the case due to a typo.
4. To fix the bug, the command to fetch the Fish shell version should be corrected to 'fish --version' instead of 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function from 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to 'fish --version'.
- This change will correctly fetch the Fish shell version and ensure that the test passes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the above correction in the `info` function, the bug related to fetching the Fish shell version will be fixed, and the failing test will pass as expected.
