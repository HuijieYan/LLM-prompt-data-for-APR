### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `info` method within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file.
- The function is attempting to fetch the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` but is using the incorrect command.
- The failing test is checking if the returned version matches the expected version and also if the correct command is being called using `Popen`.

### Identified Errors:
1. The command passed to `Popen` is incorrect (`'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) and it should be `'fish', '--version'`.
2. The expected version format is not matching the actual version provided by the `stdout.read()` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to fetch the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.
2. Modify how the version is extracted from the output of `Popen` to match the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version and return it in the expected format.
