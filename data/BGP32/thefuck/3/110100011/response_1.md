The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test function is setting up `Popen` to return the output of `fish --version`, which is causing the test to fail.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function. It should be modified to match the command used in the test function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by a mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function and the command set up in the test case. This mismatch causes the test to fail because the expected output does not match the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function should be updated to match the command set up in the test case. This way, the test case and the function execution will be consistent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In the corrected version above, the command `fish --version` is used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The output is then parsed to extract only the version number, which is used to construct the version string in the desired format.

By making this change, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell when executed, allowing the corresponding test to pass successfully.
