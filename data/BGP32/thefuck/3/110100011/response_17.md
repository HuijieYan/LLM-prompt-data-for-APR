## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of Fish Shell using `Popen` and then formatting it.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` is mocking the output of `Popen` to emulate the version output.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `-v` flag in the `TheFuck` plugin causes a recursive loop due to the way the version is retrieved in the `Fish.info()` function.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` in `Fish.info()`.
5. We need to update the command used in `Popen` to resolve the bug.


## Fix:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

In the fixed version:
1. Replace `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` with `['fish', '--version']` in the `Popen` command to retrieve Fish Shell version correctly.
2. Update the format of the version string to remove unnecessary parts.

Now the `Fish` class should be able to correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version and pass the failing test while resolving the reported issue.
