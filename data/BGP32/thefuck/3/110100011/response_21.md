### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, test code, the GitHub issue
- The buggy function is `info` in the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project.
- The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (`Fish Shell <version>`).
- The test function `test_info` in `test_fish.py` mocks the `Popen` call and expects the version to be retrieved correctly.
- The GitHub issue states that when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop due to `Fish.info()`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The argument passed to `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test expects `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The reading process of `stdout` from the `proc` may not be optimal, leading to incorrect version retrieval.
3. There might be an issue with the encoding/decoding process of the retrieved version string.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises from a mismatch in the command used in the function (`'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) and the command expected in the test (`['fish', '--version']`). Additionally, the reading process of `stdout` and decoding of the version string might be incorrect, leading to the test failure.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to match the test expectations.
2. Make sure to correctly process and decode the version string retrieved from the `stdout`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

By making the above modifications, the bug should be fixed, the test should pass, and the issue described on GitHub should be resolved.
