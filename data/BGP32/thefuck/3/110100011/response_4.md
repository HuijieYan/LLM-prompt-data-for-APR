Potential error locations:
1. The command used in Popen is ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], but the test is expecting ['fish', '--version'].
2. The decoding method used on `proc.stdout.read()`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the mismatch in the command used in the Popen call within the `info` function. It is expecting the output of ['fish', '--version'] but actually executing ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']. This discrepancy leads to the function returning an incorrect version format.
Since the test is expecting 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the command being executed fetches the version in a different way, the test fails.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command in the Popen call to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expected output in the test function. Additionally, ensure to properly handle the decoding method for `proc.stdout.read()` output.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the Popen call to ['fish', '--version'] and modifying the decoding method for `proc.stdout.read()` to fetch and format the version correctly, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
