## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, the test provided is expecting the command `fish --version` to be executed instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

The bug causes the test to fail because the function is not providing the expected output due to the discrepancy in the command being executed.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. Since the test is expecting `fish --version`, it fails when the function executes `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, the command executed in the `info` function should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expectations of the test.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will correctly return the version of the Fish shell as expected by the test, fixing the bug.
