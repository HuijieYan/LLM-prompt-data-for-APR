### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 
2. The test case is setting the expected output as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` after mocking the `Popen` behavior.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `thefuck` plugin is running `thefuck -v` which triggers a recursive loop due to the faulty implementation in `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`.
4. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect command being used to obtain the Fish Shell version and failing to match the expected output in the test case.
5. A fix should involve changing the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version and making sure it aligns with the test case's expectations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command to properly retrieve the Fish Shell version.
2. Update the test case to ensure it aligns with the updated command and the expected output.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Now, the function uses the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to obtain the Fish Shell version. It then extracts the version number from the output to construct the appropriate return string format.

This updated implementation should fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
