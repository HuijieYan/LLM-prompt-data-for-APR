### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class from `shells/fish.py` is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test function `test_info` in `test_fish.py` is expecting the version to be extracted using the command `fish --version`.
2. The bug is causing the test to fail because the actual command being used to fetch the Fish shell version does not match the expected command in the test.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` within Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop, which is likely related to the incorrect extraction of the shell version in the `info` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `info` function to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
5. The updated `info` function should be modified as follows:

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # Updated version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

### After fixing the issue with the updated function, the test should now pass successfully.
