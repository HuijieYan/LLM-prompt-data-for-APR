### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `shells` module in the `thefuck` project.
2. The function uses `Popen` to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell.
3. The failing test `test_info` in `test_fish.py` expects the function to return the correct version of Fish shell and also checks the command used with `Popen`.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the use of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop in `Fish.info()`.

### Error Location:
The issue is due to the incorrect command being executed to get the Fish shell version. The command used in `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'])` doesn't match the expected command `['fish', '--version']`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version. The test case expects the version to be retrieved using `['fish', '--version']`, but the function actually runs `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Fix Strategy:
Change the command used with `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly get the Fish shell version as expected by the test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
``` 

In the corrected version, the command sent to `Popen` is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version information. Additionally, the version string is manipulated to extract and return only the version number without other unnecessary text.
