### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. However, it is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` to get the version.
2. The failing test is trying to assert the output of `shell.info()` against 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' while also checking if `Popen` was called with `['fish', '--version']`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly fetching the version of the Fish shell, leading to a mismatch in the test assertion. The mention in the GitHub issue provides more context on how this bug relates to using the `thefuck -v` command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Retrieve the last element to capture the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version number correctly from the output, we address the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
