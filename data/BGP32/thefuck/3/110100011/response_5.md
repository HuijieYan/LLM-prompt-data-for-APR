## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the command used to get the Fish version is incorrect (`echo $FISH_VERSION`). Additionally, the expected version string is different from what the test is providing.
2. The failing test is expecting the version to be retrieved as `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the `info()` function is trying to retrieve just the version number and create a formatted string.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the use of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop, which could be related to the incorrect way of retrieving the version in the `info()` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the command used to get the Fish shell version and adjust the way the version is processed in the `info()` function.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Adjust the logic of the `info()` function to handle the version string provided by the test.
3. Ensure that the correct version information is extracted and formatted correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_parts = version.split(', version ')[1].split('\n')[0]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_parts)
```

With this correction, the `info()` function will now correctly extract the Fish shell version and format it as `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`, as expected by the test.
