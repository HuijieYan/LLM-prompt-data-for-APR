### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. However, the test provided expects to read the version by running `fish --version`, which is not implemented in the current code.
- The `Popen` call in the `info` function is constructed with different arguments than what is expected by the test.
- The test setup is mocking the read output of `Popen` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is not the exact output of the current implementation. This causes the test to fail.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The cause of the bug is due to a mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function and the command expected by the test.
- The `info` function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test is expecting `fish --version`. This leads to the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs, causing the test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `info` function to execute the command `fish --version` to fetch the Fish shell version as expected by the test.
- Update the test setup to mock the `Popen` call to return the correct output for the modified implementation of the `info` function.
- Ensure that the `info` function correctly reads the output of `Popen` to get the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command and pass the provided test case.
