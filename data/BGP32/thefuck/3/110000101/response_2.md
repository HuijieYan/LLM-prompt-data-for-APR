### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in the shell. However, the way it reads the output of the process is incorrect, leading to a potential bug.

### Error location
The error is likely in the way the function is trying to read the output from the process `proc`.

### Bug explanation
The bug is caused by directly reading from `proc.stdout` without checking if the process has finished executing or if there are any errors. This can lead to reading an empty or incomplete output, resulting in incorrect version information being returned.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish executing and then read the output. Additionally, we should handle any potential errors that might occur during the process execution.

### Corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
