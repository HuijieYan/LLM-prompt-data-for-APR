### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to read from `proc.stdout` before waiting for the `Popen` process to finish executing. This can lead to an empty or incomplete output being read.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we should wait for the `Popen` process to complete before reading from `proc.stdout`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version of the function will ensure that the `Popen` process is completed before reading from `proc.stdout`, preventing the bug where incomplete or empty output is read.
