### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. The issue arises because the `stdout.read()` method is being called directly on the `proc.stdout` object, which can lead to errors due to potential blocking or buffering issues.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `stdout.read()` method is called directly on `proc.stdout`, which may not return the expected output due to potential buffering or blocking. This can lead to an empty `version` value being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object instead of directly calling `stdout.read()`. This method ensures that all data is read from the pipes and the process is completed before returning the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
