### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the issue arises from how it reads the output of the command. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is used to read the output, but it appears to be causing issues with the mocked objects (MagicMock).

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` is not returning the expected string value `'3.5.9'` but instead is returning a MagicMock object. This leads to the incorrect version being returned in the formatted string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly capture and decode the output of the command to ensure that we get the correct version string.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to retrieve the output of the command correctly, and then it is decoded and stripped to get the version string.
