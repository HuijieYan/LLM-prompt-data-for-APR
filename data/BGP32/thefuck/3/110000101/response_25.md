## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish). It uses the `Popen` function to run a command to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, the bug lies in how the function reads the output of the subprocess.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function tries to read the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which returns a `bytes` object. Then it tries to decode this `bytes` object using `decode('utf-8')`, which converts it to a string. This string is then stripped and returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the subprocess is correctly decoded into a string before further processing. We can do this by using `communicate()` instead of `stdout.read()`, which will return a tuple containing the stdout and stderr output of the subprocess.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version uses `communicate()` to get the output of the subprocess as bytes, then decodes it into a string before returning the formatted result.
