### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the provided function is due to not waiting for the `Popen` process to complete before reading its output. To fix this, we need to use the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and obtain the output. Additionally, we should handle any potential errors that may occur during the process execution.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error getting Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
