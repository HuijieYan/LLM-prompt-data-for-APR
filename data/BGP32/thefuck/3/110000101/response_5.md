### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` and reading the output. However, it seems to be missing the step of waiting for the process to finish before trying to read the output. This can lead to the `proc.stdout.read()` call not obtaining the expected value since the process might not have finished executing yet.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the function is trying to read the output of `proc` without ensuring that the process has completed its execution. This can lead to inaccurate or missing output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to wait for the process to finish before attempting to read the output. We can achieve this by adding `proc.wait()` before reading the output.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` before reading the output, we ensure that the process has completed before trying to obtain the version information. This should fix the bug and provide the expected output.
