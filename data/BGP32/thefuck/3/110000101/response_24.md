### Analysis
The bug in the provided function lies in the handling of the subprocess `Popen` object. The `stdout` attribute of the `Popen` object is read and decoded directly before it is checked if the process has completed or the output is ready. This can lead to potential issues if the process has not finished execution or if the output is not ready when the decoding is attempted.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to read the stdout of the subprocess without checking if the process has completed or if the output is ready, leading to potential errors due to timing issues.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we wait for the subprocess to finish execution and that the output is ready to be read before attempting to decode the output. This can be achieved by adding a `proc.wait()` call before reading and decoding the stdout. Additionally, we need to check for potential errors in the subprocess execution to handle any exceptions.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # wait for the process to finish
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            return 'Failed to get Fish Shell version'
        
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
