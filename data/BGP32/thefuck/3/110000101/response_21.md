### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to run a command and retrieve the output. However, the function is not handling the `Popen` object correctly and is directly trying to read from its `stdout` attribute. This can lead to potential issues if the `Popen` object is not handled properly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `Popen` object `proc` is not being managed correctly. The function is trying to directly access the `stdout` attribute of the `proc` object without waiting for the process to finish or handling the possibility of errors.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `Popen` object by using the `communicate` method to wait for the process to finish and obtain the output. This ensures that the function retrieves the correct output from the subprocess.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
