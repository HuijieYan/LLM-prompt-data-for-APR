## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the issue lies in how the function is handling the `Popen` object and retrieving the version value. The code is trying to directly read the output from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the command to finish executing.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not waiting for the command to finish executing before trying to read the output from `proc.stdout`. This can lead to empty or incomplete output being read, resulting in an incorrect or missing version value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the `Popen` process to finish executing the command before reading its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to end and then return the stdout and stderr outputs as a tuple.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version of the `info` function correctly waits for the process to finish executing before reading the output. This fix ensures that the version value is retrieved accurately.
