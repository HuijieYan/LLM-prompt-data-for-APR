### Fixing the bug
The bug in the provided function lies in the handling of the `proc.stdout` object. The `proc.stdout.read()` function is not returning the expected value directly, leading to incorrect results. To fix this bug, we can use `communicate()` method to read the output from the process instead of `proc.stdout.read()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()`, we can properly read the output of the process and decode it to get the version value correctly.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
