### Fixing the bug
The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect usage of `Popen` and not handling the `communicate()` method properly to read the output. The current implementation assumes directly reading from `proc.stdout`, which might not always work as expected.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of `Popen` to properly read the output from the process. This will ensure that we get the correct version value.

Additionally, we can add error handling to catch any exceptions that might occur during the process execution.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the output from the process is correctly read using `communicate()` method and then decoded to get the version information.
