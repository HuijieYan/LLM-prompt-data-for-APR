### Analysis
The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the issue lies in how it is trying to read the output from the subprocess. The function is using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` to read the output, but it is not handling the case where the subprocess has not finished executing and there is no output to read yet. This causes the `version` variable to be an empty string.

### Potential Error Location
The error is likely occurring when trying to read the output from the subprocess before it has finished executing.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to read the output from the subprocess before it has completed execution, resulting in an empty `version` variable.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish executing before trying to read its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to finish and returns a tuple containing the `stdout` and `stderr` data.

### Corrected Function
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the subprocess has finished executing before trying to read its output. This will prevent the empty `version` variable issue and correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
