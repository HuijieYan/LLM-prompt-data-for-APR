The bug in the provided function lies in how the output of the Popen process is being handled. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is not reading the output of the process correctly, leading to an incorrect version value being extracted.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to read the output instead of directly calling `read()` on `proc.stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to get the output of the process, we ensure that the version is extracted correctly. This corrected version should now return the expected values for the given test case.
