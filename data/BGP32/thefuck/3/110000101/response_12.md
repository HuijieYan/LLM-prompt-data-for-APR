### Analysis
The bug in the given function occurs because the `Popen` object's `stdout` is being read before `communicate()` method is called to retrieve the output. This results in an empty output because the output stream is not properly handled.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly capture the output of the command. This method will ensure that the command execution is completed and the output is retrieved before reading it.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version of the function uses `proc.communicate()` to wait for the command execution to finish and capture the output from the process. Then, the output is properly decoded and stripped before returning the formatted string with the version information.
