### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). The function uses `Popen` from the `subprocess` module to execute a command (`'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'`) and capture the output. However, the issue seems to be related to how the output is read and decoded, leading to incorrect version retrieval.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` sequence is trying to read from the `stdout` stream multiple times, leading to unexpected behavior. It seems like `proc.stdout.read()` is being called twice, which is unnecessary and can cause issues.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should read the output once and store it in a variable before manipulating it further. This will ensure consistent behavior when retrieving the version information.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.stdout.close()  # Close the stream to prevent further reading
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(output)
``` 

By storing the output in a variable `output` after reading it once, we prevent any issues that may arise from multiple read attempts on the `stdout` stream. Additionally, closing the stream after reading ensures proper stream management.
