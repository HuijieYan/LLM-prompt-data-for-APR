### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. The issue arises because the `Popen` object is not being handled correctly. The `read()` method is being called on `proc.stdout` directly, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that `proc.stdout.read()` is called without waiting for the process to finish or handling any errors that may occur.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should wait for the process to finish and handle any errors that may occur when running the command.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        _, err = proc.communicate()
        if err:
            return "Fish Shell version unavailable"
        version = _.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
