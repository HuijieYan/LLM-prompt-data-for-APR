## Analysis
- The buggy function `info()` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
- The error message indicates that the retrieved version string has an extra piece of information `fish,` in front of the actual version number.
- The test is failing because the expected result does not match the actual result due to this extra piece of information.
- The bug is likely caused by the incorrect way the version output is being extracted and formatted.

## Bug Location
- The bug is located in how the version output is processed after executing the command with `Popen`.
- Specifically, the issue is with how the version string is being decoded and stripped in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

## Cause of the Bug
- The bug is caused by not handling the command output correctly. The `decode()` method converts the byte string to a Unicode string, but the byte string contains additional information (like `fish,`) that should be removed before formatting the version string.
- As a result, the extracted version string contains the extra `fish,` which causes the test to fail when comparing the actual and expected results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, modify the way the version string is processed after reading from the output stream. Remove any unwanted text before formatting the version string.
- Check the structure of the output string to ensure it aligns with the expected format.
- Additionally, consider error handling in case the command output does not match the expected format.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version number from the output string
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number excluding 'fish,'
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Format the version string
```

By splitting the output string at the comma and then extracting the second part, we can get the version number without the extra `fish,` text. This corrected version should address the bug and make the function return the correct version string for comparison in the test.
