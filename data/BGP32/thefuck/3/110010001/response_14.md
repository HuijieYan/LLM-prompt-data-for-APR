### Analysis:
- The provided buggy function is the `info` method within the `Fish` class.
- The function is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell by running a command using `Popen`.
- The error message indicates that the expected result of the version (`Fish Shell 3.5.9`) does not match the actual result (`Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`).
- The incorrect output is due to how the version is retrieved and formatted from the subprocess output.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The extraction of the version string from the subprocess output is not correct.
2. The formatting of the version before returning it might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
- The incorrect extraction of the version string from the subprocess output leads to extra text being included in the version information, resulting in a mismatch between expected and actual outputs.
- The issue arises from not parsing the output of `Popen` correctly when reading the version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the method to correctly extract only the version information from the subprocess output by manipulating the string.
- Format the version information as expected before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract version number from the output by splitting and extracting the version part
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By splitting the version string properly and ensuring only the version number is included in the output, we can fix the bug and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test.
