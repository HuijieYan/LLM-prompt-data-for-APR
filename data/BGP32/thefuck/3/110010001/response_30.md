### Analysis:
1. The `Fish` class contains a buggy function `info` that is responsible for retrieving the version of the Fish shell. The function uses the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to execute a command that retrieves the version of the shell.
2. The error occurs when comparing the expected output of the `info` function with the actual output.
3. The error message indicates that the expected output includes extra characters `"fish, version "` which cause the assertion to fail.
4. The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly parsing the output from the subprocess command to extract only the version number.
5. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to extract and return only the version number from the output obtained from the `Popen` command.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(", version ")[1].strip())
```

In the fixed version of the function, the output obtained from the `Popen` command is split using `", version "` as the delimiter, and only the second part of the split result (which is the version number) is extracted and returned. This ensures that only the version number is included in the return string, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
