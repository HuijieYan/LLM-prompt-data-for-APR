1. The buggy function `info` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` method from the `subprocess` module to execute a command ('fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION') and read the output of the command. The error message indicates that the expected output of the function does not match the actual output.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is when extracting the version information from the command output and formatting it with the shell name. This process involves decoding the output of the `Popen` command and formatting it into a string.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the output of the `Popen` command. It reads the command output as bytes using `proc.stdout.read()` and then tries to decode it, but does not handle the decoding correctly, leading to an incorrect version string being generated.

4. To fix the bug, we need to properly decode the output of the `Popen` command and extract the version information. Then, format this information into the correct string format ('Fish Shell {version}').

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we add the `split(',')` method to extract the version part after splitting the output by the comma. This ensures that only the version number is captured and then formatted correctly in the return statement.
