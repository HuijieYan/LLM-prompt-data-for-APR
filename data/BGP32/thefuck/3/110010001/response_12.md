1. Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to get the version of the current Fish shell using a subprocess. However, the `assert` statement in the test case is failing because the version string obtained includes additional text like "fish, version" which is not expected. This discrepancy is causing the assertion error.

2. Potential Error Locations:
The issue seems to be with how the version string is being extracted from the subprocess output.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the version retrieved from the subprocess output contains extra text, which is not expected in the assert statement in the test case. The extra text "fish, version" is not part of the desired version string, causing the assertion error.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted from the subprocess output in the `info` function. Instead of returning the entire output, we should only extract the version number.

5. Corrected Version of the `info` Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the version string obtained from the subprocess output will be modified to include only the version number without the extra text. This will ensure that the assert statement in the test case passes successfully.
