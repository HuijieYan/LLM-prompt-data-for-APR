## 1. Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Message:
- The buggy function is the `info` method inside the `Fish` class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell in this case).
- The error message indicates an assertion failure in the test for the `info` method. The actual output from the function includes additional text ("fish, version") which is not expected.

## 2. Potential Error Locations:
- The method seems to be extracting the version from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, but the way it's being handled might be causing extra characters to be included in the version string.

## 3. Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the way the version string is being extracted and formatted. The error message provides insight that the current implementation of the `info` method returns a version string that includes extra text ("fish, version") which causes the assertion to fail.

## 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted to ensure that only the version number is included without the additional text.

## 5. Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        # Use a different approach to extract the version without extra text
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()` is used to extract only the version part from the output of the shell command without the extra text. This should resolve the bug and make the `info` method return the correct version string.
