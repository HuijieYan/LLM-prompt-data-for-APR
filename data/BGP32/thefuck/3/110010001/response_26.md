1. Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy is caused by the incorrect parsing of the shell version obtained from the subprocess call in the 'info' function of the Fish class.

2. Potential error locations:
The erroneous line is where the version is extracted from the output of the subprocess call:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by directly reading the output of the subprocess call using `proc.stdout.read()` without considering the newline character in the output. This results in the version string being 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' instead of '3.5.9'.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
Parse the version string correctly by splitting the output based on the comma and space to extract the actual version number.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string obtained from the subprocess call based on the comma and space, we can extract the version number '3.5.9' correctly, resolving the issue and ensuring that the corrected version of the function passes the failing test.
