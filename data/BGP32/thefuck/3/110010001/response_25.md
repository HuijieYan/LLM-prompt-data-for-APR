1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` is defined within the `Fish` class, which appears to be a shell type specific class in the context of a larger project that handles different types of shells.
- The function uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command in the fish shell and retrieve the version of the shell.
- The error message indicates that the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

2. Potential error locations:
- The issue seems to be related to how the command output is processed and formatted.
- There might be a discrepancy in expected output format and the actual output of the executed command.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The buggy function reads the output from the command and directly appends it to the format string, leading to an unexpected format of the version information.
- The actual output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is 'fish, version 3.5.9', which includes unnecessary text that is not part of the version number.
- This leads to the incorrect comparison between the expected and actual output.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the way the command output is processed to extract only the version number.
- Ensure that the extracted version number is in the correct format before appending it to the output string.
- Strip any unnecessary text or characters from the version number before formatting the final output.

5. Corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version:
- The command output is stored in the variable `version_output`.
- The version number is extracted by splitting the output at the comma and getting the second part, which contains the version.
- This extracted version is then used to form the final output string, which is in the correct format ('Fish Shell 3.5.9').
- The corrected function should now pass the failing test and format the version number correctly.
