### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info(self)` which is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically, the Fish shell.
2. The function uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to run a command in the Fish shell to get the version.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between the expected version string and the actual version string is failing. The expected version string is missing the actual version number.
4. The bug is likely caused by an incorrect formatting of the version number string.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `info(self)` of the `Fish` class is due to the formatting of the version number retrieved from the command output. The formatting used in the return statement is missing the actual version number, which results in a failed comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version number extracted from the command output is correctly formatted in the return statement of the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

In the corrected version, we replace the initial part of the version string `fish, version ` with an empty string to get the correct version number. Now the return statement will correctly format the version with the prefix 'Fish Shell' followed by the actual version number.
