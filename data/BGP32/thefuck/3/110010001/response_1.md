1. The buggy function `info` is responsible for extracting the version of the Fish shell by running a command on the shell and capturing its output. The error message indicates that the output format obtained from the shell is not as expected, resulting in a failed assertion in the test case.

2. The potential error in the buggy function could be related to how the version information is extracted from the shell command output and formatted to return.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the format inconsistency of the version output obtained from the Fish shell. The extracted version includes extra characters like "fish, version" which are not expected. This discrepancy causes the assertion to fail when compared with the expected formatted string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the information extraction logic from the shell output to correctly capture only the version number and then format the string suitable for comparison with the expected output.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the extracted version on the ',' character and selecting the second part, which represents only the numerical version, we can ensure that only the version number is extracted. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
