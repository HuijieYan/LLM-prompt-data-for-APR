1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. The output of this command is read, decoded to UTF-8, and stripped. However, the output format is not as expected, which leads to the failing test.

2. The potential error location is in the line where the `version` variable is assigned by reading the stdout of the `proc` process.

3. The cause of the bug is that the output retrieved from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command includes the initial string "fish, version" before the actual version number. This causes the comparison in the test case to fail because the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', not 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the processing of the output to extract only the version number and discard the extra string "fish, version" before creating the formatted output string.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the version number extracted from the output of the command is used to create the correct formatted output string. This change should make the test pass successfully.
