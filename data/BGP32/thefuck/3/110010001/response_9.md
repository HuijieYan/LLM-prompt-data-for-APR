### 1. Analysis:
- The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell), but it is not correctly parsing the version information.
- The `Popen` class is used to open subprocesses and get their output, and it is expected to retrieve the Fish shell version from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
- The output of the command is decoded and formatted to return the shell name and version.

### 2. Potential Error Location:
- The error is likely due to how the version is being parsed from the command output.
- The incorrect decoding or formatting of the output might lead to the incorrect version format.
- The comparison between the expected version and the actual version might be flawed.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by not correctly handling the output of the `Popen` subprocess when retrieving the Fish shell version.
- The output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command includes the text "fish, version" before the actual version number, leading to incorrect parsing.
- This causes the assertion error when comparing the expected version with the version extracted.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The version extracted needs to be properly cleaned up to remove any unnecessary text before comparing it with the expected version. 
- Additionally, the string should be split by `,` and the version number should be extracted from the list to ensure only the version number is returned.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Clean up version text to extract only the version number
        version = version.split(', version')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- After decoding the output, we split the version text by `', version'` and extract the later part which contains the version number.
- This ensures that only the version number is considered in the output, fixing the bug related to incorrect parsing.
- The corrected version should now pass the failing test by correctly returning the formatted shell name and version.
