## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is part of the `Fish` class in the `thefuck.shells.fish` module.
2. The `info` function is using `Popen` from `subprocess` to execute a command in the shell and fetch the version of the Fish shell.
3. The error indicates that the expected version output is different from the actual version output retrieved from the command execution. The command execution result is showing `fish, version 3.5.9` instead of just `3.5.9`.
4. The bug in the buggy function is caused by not correctly parsing and extracting the version number from the output of the command execution.
5. To fix the bug, a strategy needs to be implemented to extract only the version number without any additional characters.

## Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function that properly extracts the version number without any additional characters:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_raw = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_raw.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, when the `info` function is called, it will extract the version number correctly without including 'fish, version' in the final output.
