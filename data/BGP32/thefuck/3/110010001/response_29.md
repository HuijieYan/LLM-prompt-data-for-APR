### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` is located within the `Fish` class in the file `fish.py`.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion of the test is failing because the output of the function does not match the expected output. The function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
3. The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the command executed through `Popen`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly extract and format the version number from the output.
5. The corrected version with the necessary changes is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version number from the output
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the version number extracted from the output will be formatted correctly, and the test should pass successfully.
