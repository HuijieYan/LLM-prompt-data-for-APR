1. The buggy function `info()` is within the `Fish` class of the `thefuck.shells.fish` module. The function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell being used by executing the command `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The error indicates that the version extracted from the process output is not the expected value.

2. The potential error location is the conversion of the command output to a string in the line `'utf-8'`. The discrepancy in the version comparison may also be due to the incorrect formatting of the extracted version.

3. The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect handling of the command output or the addition of unwanted characters while processing the version. This results in a mismatch when comparing the extracted version with the expected output.

4. To fix the bug, we should decode the byte string obtained from the `proc.stdout` using the `'utf-8'` encoding. Then, ensure that the formatting of the version matches the expected format `'Fish Shell x.x.x'` where `x.x.x` represents the version number.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    
    # Decode the byte string output and strip whitespace
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract and format the version number from the output
    version = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()
    
    # Return the formatted shell name and version
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected version of the `info()` function, the extracted version number is now properly formatted and compared to the expected output, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
