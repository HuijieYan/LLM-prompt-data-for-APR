1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class of the `thefuck.shells.fish` module is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (`Fish Shell x.x.x`). The error message in the failing test indicates that the actual output of the function includes extra characters (`Fish Shell fish, version x.x.x`) that are not expected.

2. The potential error in the buggy function is likely due to the way the `FISH_VERSION` is being extracted from the command output. The incorrect parsing may lead to additional text being included in the version string.

3. The cause of the bug is in the incorrect parsing of the output from the subprocess call to get the Fish Shell version. The actual value returned from the subprocess includes "fish, version" text that is not needed in the final version string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version is extracted from the subprocess output to get rid of the additional text and only keep the version number.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `info(self)` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, after stripping the output and decoding it, we use the `split(',')` method to split the output based on a comma and then select the second part using `[1]`. This ensures that only the version number is extracted without any additional text. Now the test assertion `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` should pass successfully.
