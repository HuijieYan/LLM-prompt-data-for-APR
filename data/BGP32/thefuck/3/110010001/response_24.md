1. The buggy function `info` is a method defined in the class `Fish` which inherits from the `Generic` class. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the function currently does not extract the version text correctly, resulting in a failing test that compares the expected version string with the actual output containing additional text.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Reading the output of the subprocess.
   - Constructing the version string using the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `info` expects the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to return only the version number, but the actual output contains additional text like `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, resulting in the incorrect version information extracted by the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of the command and extract only the version number before constructing the version string. This can be achieved by splitting the output to extract the version information and then constructing the final string.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract version number from the output
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    
    # Construct the correct version string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output on the comma and taking the second part, we extract only the version number without additional text, allowing the function to construct the correct version string for comparison in the test.
