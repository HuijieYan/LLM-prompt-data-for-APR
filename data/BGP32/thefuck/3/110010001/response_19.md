## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, the error message indicates that the output format is not correct. It is missing the parsing of the version string 'fish, version x.x.x' to extract only the version number.
2. Potential error location is where the version string is being read from the subprocess output and incorrectly formatted.
3. The cause of the bug is that the output obtained from the `proc.stdout.read()` call includes extra characters like 'fish, version' along with the version number, causing the mismatch in the assertion test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to parse and extract only the version number from the output obtained.
5. We should update the `info` function to correctly format the version string extracted from the subprocess output and return it in the 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        version = version_output.split(', ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version correctly extracts only the version number from the output obtained from the subprocess, fixes the formatting issue, and returns the version in the expected 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format.
