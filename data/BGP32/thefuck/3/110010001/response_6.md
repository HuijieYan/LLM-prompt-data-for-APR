1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class in the `thefuck.shells.fish` module. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The error message indicates that the actual output differs from the expected output.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The way the version is read from the stdout of the subprocess.
   - Formatting of the version string.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug occurs because the output obtained from the subprocess includes extra characters like `fish, version` in addition to the version number. This additional information is not removed before constructing the final string, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   To fix the bug, we need to strip out the irrelevant text "fish, version" from the output obtained from the subprocess before constructing the final version string.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `replace` method to remove the "fish, version " text from the version string before merging it with the "Fish Shell" prefix. This modification ensures that only the version number remains in the final output.
