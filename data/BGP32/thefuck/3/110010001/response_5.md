### Analysis
The buggy function attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, there are a couple of potential issues that could lead to the failing test:
1. The output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command includes the literal string `"fish, version"` which is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.
2. The `stdout.read()` method may not return the entire output of the command, which can cause missing characters in the result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Adjust the command to properly extract and format the version number without the unnecessary literal string.
2. Ensure that we read the entire output of the subprocess.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we split the `version` string based on comma (`,`) and extract the second part which corresponds to the version number. This ensures that we remove the unnecessary part of the output.
