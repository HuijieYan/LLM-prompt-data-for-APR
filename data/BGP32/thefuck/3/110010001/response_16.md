## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`.
2. The error occurs when the `assert` statement in the test method fails due to a mismatch in the expected version string.
3. The bug arises because the output retrieved from the subprocess includes "fish, version" in addition to the actual version number.
4. To fix the bug, the function should extract only the version number from the output before constructing the version string.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_full = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_full.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After fixing the bug in the `info` function by extracting only the version number from the output of the subprocess, the test should pass without any assertion errors.
