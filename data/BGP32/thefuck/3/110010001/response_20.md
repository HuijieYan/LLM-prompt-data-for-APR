1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, it fails to correctly extract and format the version from the output of the subprocess. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

2. Potential error locations:
   - Extraction of the version from the subprocess output.
   - Formatting the version into the desired string format.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug is caused by not correctly processing the output from the `Popen` subprocess call, resulting in extra text being included in the version information. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual output strings.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   To fix the bug, we need to properly extract and format the version information obtained from the subprocess call. This involves trimming unnecessary text and ensuring the extracted version is in the expected format.

5. Corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output obtained from the `Popen` command based on the comma and extract the version information correctly. This should align the output of the function with the expected result and resolve the bug.
