### Analysis
1. The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The issue arises from the fact that the version output includes extra text like "fish, version" which is not expected.
3. The failing test expects the function to return the version number only, without any additional text.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the parsing of the version output to extract only the version number from the string.
5. The corrected version should strip away the unnecessary text to match the expected output.

### Bug Fix
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_with_prefix = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_with_prefix.split(" ")[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After applying this fix, the function will extract and return only the version number, resolving the failing test case and aligning with the expected output.
