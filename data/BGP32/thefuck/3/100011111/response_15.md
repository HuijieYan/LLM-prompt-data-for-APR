### Fixing the Bug

#### 1. Analyzing the Bug
- The buggy function is trying to determine the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output.
- The issue arises from the fact that the output includes additional text ("fish, version") along with the actual version number.
- This discrepancy causes the `assert` statement in the failing test to fail.
  
#### 2. Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to extract the version number from the output string and return only the version number without any additional text.

#### 3. Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(" ")[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the `version` string based on space and taking the last element, we extract only the version number. This corrected function should now return the version in the expected format and pass the failing test.
