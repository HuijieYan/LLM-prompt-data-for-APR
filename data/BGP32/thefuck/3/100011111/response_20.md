## Fixing the Bug

### 1. Analysis:
The error occurs due to the incorrect formatting of the version string in the `Fish.info()` function. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### 2. Error Location:
The bug is in the line where the `Fish.info()` function creates the output string by appending `'Fish Shell'` to the version number.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug in the `Fish.info()` function is caused by not extracting only the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to extract only the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### 5. Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract only the version number
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will extract only the version number from the output of the command and format it correctly to return `'Fish Shell <version>'`. This should resolve the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck` using the version command.
