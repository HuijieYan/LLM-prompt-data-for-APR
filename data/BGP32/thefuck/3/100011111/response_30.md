### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to extract the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the extraction process is incorrect, resulting in the version being displayed as `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`. This discrepancy leads to the failing assertion test.

The error message indicates the actual output as `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This is due to the incorrect formatting of the version string returned by the function.

The GitHub issue further explains the impact on the Fish shell initialization due to this bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, the function needs to correctly extract and format the Fish shell version without additional words and commas.

### Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the shell command based on spaces and taking the last element from the split result, we can extract only the version number without additional text. This modification will ensure that the version returned by the function matches the expected format and passes the failing test.
