### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info` in the `fish.py` file. It tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell but is not processing the output correctly.
2. The error message shows an assertion failure where the version returned by the function includes unwanted information leading to the assertion error.
3. The current function appears to be reading the version output "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9", causing the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to extract only the version number from the output.
5. The corrected version of the function will extract and return only the version number without any extra information.

### Correction
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip() # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the `version` line to extract and return only the version number without any extra information, the corrected function will now return the expected version without any additional output.
