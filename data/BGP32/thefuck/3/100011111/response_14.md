### Identification of Potential Error Locations
1. The function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version information from Fish Shell, but the output is not accurately processed.
2. The function is returning the entire `version` string, including unnecessary text, instead of only the version number.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function not correctly extracting and formatting the Fish Shell version information. The error message and runtime values show that the version string includes additional text ("fish, version") that is not expected in the output. This discrepancy causes the assertion to fail since the expected output does not match the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the provided output. This can be achieved by parsing the version string and removing any unnecessary text. Additionally, we should ensure that the function returns the correct formatted string with the version number.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version above, we have added `.split(',')[1].strip()` to extract only the version number part of the output string. This modification ensures that the function returns the expected output format ('Fish Shell 3.5.9'). This fix addresses the bug and should make the failing test pass successfully.
