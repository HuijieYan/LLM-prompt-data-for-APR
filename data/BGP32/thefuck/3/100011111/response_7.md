### Bug Fix Process:

1. **Issue Analysis**:
   - The buggy function is trying to extract the version information from the output of a subprocess command in Fish Shell. The error message shows that the expected version number is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
   - The `Popen` object is being mocked in the test, and the `stdout.read` is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.

2. **Bug Identification**:
   - The bug seems to be related to how the version information is extracted from the output of the subprocess command.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the extraction, resulting in the incorrect version format.

3. **Bug Explanation**:
   - The `version` variable after extracting from `proc.stdout.read()` contains the entire output of the command, including 'fish, version'. The expected format should only be the version number.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - We need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output of the subprocess command. We can split the obtained output based on `,` and then select the second part, which is the version number.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number and return it in the expected format.
