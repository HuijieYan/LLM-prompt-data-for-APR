1. The buggy function `info` is a method of the `Fish` class located in `fish.py` file under `shells` directory. The purpose of this function is to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically the Fish shell.

2. The potential error location is where the `version` is extracted from the output of the shell command. Additionally, the command being executed `echo $FISH_VERSION` might need to be updated to match what is expected in the test.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `version` extracted from the shell output includes the string `'fish, version'` along with the actual version number. This mismatch leads to the assertion error seen in the failing test message.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed to fetch the Fish shell version in a format consistent with what the test is expecting. Additionally, we need to correct the string formatting in the return statement of the `info` function to include only the version number without any extra strings.

5. Corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract version number only
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using the corrected code above, we execute the shell command to get the Fish shell version in the correct format. Then we extract only the version number from the output and return it formatted as `'Fish Shell {version}'`. This correction should resolve the assertion error in the failing test.
