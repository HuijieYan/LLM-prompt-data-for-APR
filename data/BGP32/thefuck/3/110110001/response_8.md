### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell running.
- The function attempts to get the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` in a subprocess.
- The failing test mocks the `Popen` class and sets up the side effect to simulate the output of `fish` command.
- The error message indicates that the expected version string differs from the actual version string due to an extra `fish,` and newline character.
- The incorrect call to `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is also mentioned in the failing test.

### Bug in the code:
- The issue with the existing code is that it attempts to read the output of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` directly. This command does not return only the version number, but also includes `fish,` and possibly a newline character.
- The test expects the version to be extracted from the output directly without considering the additional string content.

### Fix Strategy:
- Correct the command used to get the Fish shell version to avoid the extraneous output.
- Update the test case to match the corrected command for getting the version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version from the output
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test without any issues.
