## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to get the version of Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the test code, the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
2. The bug is in the line where the command is executed and the version is read from the process output.
3. The bug causes the version string to include unnecessary text like "fish, version" which is not part of the expected output.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the command to return only the version without additional text.
5. I will provide the corrected version of the `info` function below.

## Correction
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION | cut -d, -f2'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, I modified the command to use the `cut` command with delimiter `,` to extract the version part only. This should fix the bug and allow the test to pass successfully.
