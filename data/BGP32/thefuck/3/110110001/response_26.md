## Analysis
1. The `Fish` class contains the `info` method that retrieves the version of the current shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` class.
2. In the failing test, the expected output of the `info` method is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output returned is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. The error message indicates an issue with the version format where there is an added `"fish,"` in the output causing the assertion to fail.
4. One possible cause of the bug is the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version.
5. We need to change the command being run by the `Popen` function to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to correctly fetch the version information of the Fish shell.

## Correction
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip('fish, version '))
``` 

By changing the command in `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and adjusting the formatting of the version returned, we can fix the bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. This corrected version should now correctly extract and format the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
