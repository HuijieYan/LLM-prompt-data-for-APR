### Analysis
- The buggy function `info` attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`.
- The failing test `test_info` mocks `Popen` to return the output of the shell version command.
- The error message indicates that the expected and actual values of the shell version differ due to the unexpected format. The version string has `fish, version` at the beginning, which should be removed.
- The call to `Popen` in the buggy function uses the wrong argument `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, whereas the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is due to using the incorrect command (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) to retrieve the Fish shell version and not handling the output format correctly. The test expectation does not match the actual output of `Popen`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Change the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to get the version correctly.
2. Modify the parsing of the output to extract only the version number without any extra text.
3. Update the assertion in the test to match the corrected output format.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(", ")[1]  # Extract version only
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the shell version gets parsed correctly, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
