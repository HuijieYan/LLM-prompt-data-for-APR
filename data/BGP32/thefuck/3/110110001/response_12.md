1. The buggy function `info` belongs to the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `shells` module. It aims to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and returning a formatted string. The failing test is located in the `test_info` method of the `TestFish` test class in `test_fish.py`, where it expects the output of `shell.info()` to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but receives a different version string.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version from the subprocess.

3. The bug is occurring because the subprocess command is incorrect, resulting in the wrong version string being extracted. The error message points out that the actual output contains additional text, leading to the assertion failure.

4. To fix the bug, the subprocess command should be modified to ensure it returns only the version number. This can be achieved by using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, the subprocess command is modified to use `fish --version` to get the relevant version information. Additionally, the version string is correctly parsed to extract only the version number without additional text.
