### Analysis:
- The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to obtain the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
- The test code is mocking the return value of `stdout.read`, but the expected version string is '3.5.9' rather than 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
- The error occurs due to the incorrect format of the version information retrieved from the command output.
- The `assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']` statement in the test code is validating the executed command, but it doesn't match the actual command used in the `info` function. So, this assertion would also fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the command executed by `Popen` in the `info` function to correctly obtain only the version number.
- Update the expectation in the test code to match the corrected output format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

The corrected code above reads the correct version string from the shell output and formats it accordingly. This will resolve the issue of mismatched version information and the failing test.
