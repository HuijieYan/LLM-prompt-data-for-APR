### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `info` method in the `Fish` class, which aims to return the name and version of the Fish shell.
2. The test code is checking if the `info` method correctly returns the formatted version of the Fish shell name.
3. The cause of the bug is that the test data provided to the `Popen` mock does not match the expected version format, leading to a mismatch in the assert statement.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the test data given to the `Popen` mock to match the expected version format.
5. The corrected version of the `info` method should read the version data correctly and format it as expected.

### Buggy Function Correction:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Modified the command to retrieve version correctly
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split()[-1]  # Extracts just the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command to retrieve the version correctly and extracting only the version number from the output, the corrected `info` method can now return the formatted version of the Fish shell name.
