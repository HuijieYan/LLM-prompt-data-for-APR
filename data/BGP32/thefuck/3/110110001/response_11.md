### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info(self)` inside the `Fish` class which attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. The test function `test_info(self, shell, Popen)` provides mock data for the `Popen` object to simulate the shell version.
3. The error message indicates that the function is returning the version with extra characters which are not being stripped correctly.
4. The cause of the bug is that the shell version is being extracted incorrectly from the command output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to read the output from the Popen subprocess correctly and format the version string properly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read output and strip extra characters
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Extract version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Return formatted version string
```

By properly stripping the output and extracting just the version number, we ensure that the `info()` function returns only the version in the correct format.

This fix should make the test case pass without any assertion errors.
