### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to simulate the output of the `fish --version` command.
3. The cause of the failure is that the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` does not match the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is used to fetch the version, which returns the text `fish, version 3.5.9` instead of just the version number.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed by `Popen` to directly fetch the version using `fish --version` instead of setting an indirect environment variable.

### Correction:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this modification to directly fetch the shell version using `fish --version`, the buggy function will correctly extract the version number and return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This will fix the failing test.
