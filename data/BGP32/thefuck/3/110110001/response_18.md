### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `info(self)` within the `Fish` class.
- The test code is `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file.
- The key issue is that the `Popen` command in the buggy function is using the wrong argument to determine the fish version.
- The failing test is comparing the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) with the actual output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
- The error message indicates an assertion error because the actual output is not matching the expected output.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
The command being run is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the result of `fish --version`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by using the wrong command to get the fish version. The `info` function is not retrieving the version correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the command that is being run by `Popen` to get the fish version correctly. The correct command should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(",")[1].strip().replace("version", "").strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command `['fish', '--version']` in `Popen`, the function will now correctly retrieve the fish version, pass the test, and return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, resolving the bug.
