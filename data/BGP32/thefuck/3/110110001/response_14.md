### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing the output. The test for this function in `test_fish.py` sets a side effect for the `stdout.read()` call but the actual comparison in the test fails due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

### Potential Error Location:
1. The subprocess command is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test expects `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The expected output in the test differs from the actual output format.
3. The `strip()` function may not handle the output correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by an inconsistency between the subprocess command being run and the expected command in the test, as well as differences in the expected and actual output format.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the subprocess command to `['fish', '--version']` in the `info` function so that it matches the expected command in the test.
2. Update the formatting of the expected output to match the expected version format (`3.5.9`) instead of the raw output.
3. Use `communicate()` on the process stdout to avoid issues with Unicode decoding.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function in fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By updating the subprocess command, parsing the version correctly, and formatting the output appropriately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
