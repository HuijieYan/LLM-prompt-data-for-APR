## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of Fish shell by executing a command and capturing its output. The test function expected the version to be parsed from the output `fish, version 3.5.9\n`, but the buggy function did not handle this correctly, resulting in the wrong comparison.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations could be:
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` may not be the correct command to get the Fish shell version.
2. The decoding of the output and the extraction of the version may not be correct.

## Explanation of Bug
The bug arises because the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the version string in the expected format. The decoding and stripping operations on the output are not correctly handling the version extraction.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Instead of using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command to get the version, a more direct command like `fish --version` should be used.
2. Correctly decode the output and extract only the version part to build the correct version string for the shell.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function within the `Fish` class:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
    version = output.strip().split()[-1]
    return "Fish Shell " + version
``` 

With the corrected version, the function should correctly extract the version and compare it with the expected version in the test.
