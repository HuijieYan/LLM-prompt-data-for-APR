## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test is attempting to mock the value returned by `Popen` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is expected to result in the version being extracted as `3.5.9`.
3. The error message suggests that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The bug is likely due to the mismatch between the expected version format and the actual output format.
5. To fix the bug, we should modify the way the version is extracted from the output.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    # Extract version from the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]

    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']` and updating the way the version is extracted by splitting and taking the necessary part, we can ensure that the correct version is extracted and formatted as expected. This should fix the bug and make the test pass successfully.
