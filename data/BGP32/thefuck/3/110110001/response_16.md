### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). 
- The test code in `test_info` sets up a mock `Popen` class to simulate the command output of retrieving the Fish Shell version.
- The error message indicates that the expected output has a different format from the actual output that the buggy function is generating.
- The incorrect command was being used within the `Popen` call, leading to an unexpected result.

### Bug Location:
The bug is happening in the `Fish` class where the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect command in the `Popen` call. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not provide the correct version string in the expected format.
- The output of this command does not align with the expected version format ('Fish Shell x.y.z') which leads to the assertion error.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the command used in the `Popen` call to get the correct Fish Shell version information in the expected format ('fish', '-v').
- Modify the decoding approach to match the format of the Fish Shell version output to correctly build the version string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `Popen` call now uses the command `['fish', '-v']` to retrieve the version of Fish Shell correctly. The version string is then parsed appropriately to extract just the version number before constructing and returning the expected 'Fish Shell' version output.
