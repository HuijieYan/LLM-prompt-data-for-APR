### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `info` method within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file.
2. The function executes a subprocess using `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell.
3. The failing test is comparing the output of the info method with the expected Fish shell version string.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `assert` statement is comparing the output of the `info` method without stripping unnecessary characters.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `info` method to correctly extract the version number from the subprocess output.
2. Strip any unnecessary characters from the output before formatting it as 'Fish Shell X.X.X'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

By making the `replace()` call after `strip()`, we will extract only the version number without any extra characters. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
