### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell.
   
2. **Buggy Class**: The `Fish` class seems to be a part of a larger codebase related to various shells. The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute a command and extract the version information.

3. **Test Code**: The test code for the `info` function mocks the `Popen` subprocess call to return a specific result (`fish, version 3.5.9\n`). The test expects the `info` function to return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and also checks the arguments passed to `Popen`.

4. **Error Message**: The error occurs when the actual result (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`) does not match the expected result (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`). The discrepancy in the version strings is due to an incorrect extraction of version information by the `info` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command which is used to retrieve the version information in the `info` function. Since the command output contains additional text (`fish, version `), it leads to an incorrect version being returned.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command in the `Popen` call to extract only the version number. We can make use of the `fish --version` command which outputs the version in the correct format.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `fish --version` command and extracting the version correctly from the output, the corrected `info` function should now pass the failing test.
