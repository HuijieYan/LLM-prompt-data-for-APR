### Analysis:
- The buggy function, `info`, is part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project.
- The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell.
- The test function provided tries to mock the behavior of running `fish --version` command and expects the version number to be extracted correctly.
- The failing test is due to the mismatch between the expected output (`Fish Shell 3.5.9`) and the actual output (`Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`).
- Based on the error message, it seems like the command used (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not return the version number in the expected format.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug is related to the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not provide the correct format for extracting the version.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command includes additional output that is not needed for correctly extracting the version number. This leads to an unexpected version string being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the command being run by modifying it to directly call `fish --version` which will specifically print the version number of the Fish shell. This will ensure that only the version number is extracted and returned correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return f"Fish Shell {version}"
```

By modifying the command to `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version number correctly from the output, the corrected `info` function will now pass the failing test.
