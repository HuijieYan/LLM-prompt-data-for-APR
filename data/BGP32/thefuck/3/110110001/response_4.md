### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `info` in the `Fish` class located in `thefuck/shells/fish.py`.
- The test code for this function is located in `tests/shells/test_fish.py`.
- The failing test is checking that the correct version number is extracted and formatted to display as `Fish Shell <version>`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The mismatch between the expected version string ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and the output of the Popen command ('fish, version 3.5.9') is causing the assertion error.
- The command being executed in `info` is `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the expected version string format and the actual output format from the subprocess command. Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the command being executed: `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` vs. `['fish', '--version']`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the command executed by `Popen` to '`fish --version'` to retrieve the correct version information directly.
2. Modify the expected version string to match the format output by the adjusted command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function now executes `'fish --version'` to capture the correct version information, and extracts the version number from the output. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
