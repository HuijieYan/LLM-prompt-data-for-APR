### Analysis:
- The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the Fish Shell version using a subprocess call but the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` provided may not extract the correct version.
- The failing test expects the version number to be extracted correctly and formatted as 'Fish Shell x.y.z'.
- The test is failing because the extracted version from `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is not being formatted correctly.

### Error Location:
- The issue is in the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not extracting the correct version number.

### Cause of Bug:
- The buggy function is reading the information directly from the command output without formatting it properly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the command in the subprocess call to extract the version from the correct location or change the method of getting the Fish Shell version.
- Format the extracted version properly before returning it in the `info` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to get Fish Shell version
        output = proc.stdout.readline().strip()
        version_str = output.split(b', version ')[1].decode('utf-8')
        version = version_str.split()[0]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Format the version as 'Fish Shell x.y.z'
``` 

### Updated Test Case:
```python
    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.readline.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test successfully.
