### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class uses `Popen` to execute a command and capture the version of the Fish shell by calling `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test is checking if the output of `shell.info()` matches the expected version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the command being executed to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, leading to an unexpected version string that does not match the expected result in the test.
4. To fix the bug, the command executed by `Popen` should be changed to obtain the correct version string for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", ")[1]  # Extract only the version from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By modifying the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']`, the correct version information is obtained. Additionally, extracting only the version part from the output ensures that the generated output matches the expected format for the test case.
