### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is not returning the correct version of the Fish shell.
- The function is attempting to read the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved from the output of `fish --version`.
- This discrepancy between the function implementation and the test expectation is causing the test to fail.

### Bug:
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual shell version in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the command executed by the `info` function to `fish --version` in order to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version output and pass the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the `info` function will now execute the correct command `fish --version` to fetch the version information and the test should pass successfully.
