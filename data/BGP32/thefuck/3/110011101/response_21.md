### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is caused by the fact that the `version` variable in the `info` function is not correctly extracted from the output of the `fish` command. The output includes the string "fish, version" in addition to the version number, causing the mismatch in the assertion failure.

The error message and the runtime values show that the `version` variable contains the whole output string, including "fish, version" before the actual version number. This causes the assertion to fail because the expected output does not match the actual output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly extract only the version number from the output of the `fish` command. We can achieve this by splitting the output string by space and taking the last element, which should be the version number.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output and taking the last element, we ensure that only the version number is extracted, fixing the bug and aligning the function output with the expected values.
