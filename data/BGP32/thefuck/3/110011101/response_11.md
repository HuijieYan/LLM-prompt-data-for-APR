### Potential Error Locations:
1. The parsing of the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command may not be correct.
2. The formatting of the `version` string into the final output may not be correct.
3. The comparison of the final output in the assertion statement may not be accurate.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the way the `version` string is extracted from the command output and formatted in the return statement. The extracted version string `'fish, version 3.5.9'` is not correctly parsed to just get the version number '3.5.9'. This leads to the assertion failure when comparing `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` with `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the parsing mechanism for the version string to extract only the version number.
2. Format the extracted version number appropriately for the final output.
3. Modify the assertion statement to compare the correct version and ensure a successful test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract the version number by splitting on whitespace
        version_number = version.split(' ')[-1]
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```
