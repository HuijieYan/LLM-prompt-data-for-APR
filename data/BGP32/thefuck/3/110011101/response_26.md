### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in a specific format. The issue arises from the fact that the version extracted from the command output includes unnecessary text that needs to be filtered out. The error message highlights this discrepancy in the comparison of the expected output and the actual output.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the extracted version contains additional text due to the command used to retrieve it. This additional text causes the assertion error when comparing the expected version with the actual version.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version from the command output. Specifically, we should strip the unnecessary text to only retrieve the version number before formatting it in the desired format.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version number (assuming the version is in "x.x.x" format)
        version = version.split()[-1].split(',')[0]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the way we extract the version from the command output, the corrected function will return the expected version in the specified format, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
