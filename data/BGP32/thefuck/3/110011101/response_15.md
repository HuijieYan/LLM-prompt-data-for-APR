### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` function to run a command in the Fish shell and extract the version number.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the version number is extracted and formatted.
3. The expected version in the output is just the version number without any extra text.
4. The bug appears to be caused by the function returning the version number along with the unnecessary text "fish, version" in the output.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to clean up the version number extracted from the output to only include the version number itself without any prefixes.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output by space and taking the last element, we can isolate the version number without any additional text. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
