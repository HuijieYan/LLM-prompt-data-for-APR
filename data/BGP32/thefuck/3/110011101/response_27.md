### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that the `version` variable includes extra text ("fish, version") besides the actual version number. This extra text causes the assertion in the test to fail as it doesn't match the expected output.

The incorrect `version` variable value in the runtime variables further confirms this issue.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `version` variable is not correctly extracted from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The `version` variable ends up including more text than just the version number.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly extract only the version number from the output of the command and then format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'. We can achieve this by splitting the output based on a delimiter (',' in this case) to isolate the version number.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the `version` content based on ',' and then extracting the second part (which is the version number), we ensure that only the version number is used in the formatted output. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
