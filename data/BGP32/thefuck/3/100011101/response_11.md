### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The issue lies in the way the function is extracting the version number from the output. The current implementation is including unnecessary text ("fish, version") in the version number, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

### Bug
The bug stems from not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The function is not properly removing the unwanted text from the version number in the output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output. We should strip the text "fish, version" from the obtained version number.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number by removing "fish, version"
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using the corrected function above, the function will correctly extract the version number from the shell output and return the expected result.
