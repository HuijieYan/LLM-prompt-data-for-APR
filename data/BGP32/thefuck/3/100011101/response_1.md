### Explanation:
The buggy function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the output of the command includes the text `fish, version` followed by the actual version number. This causes the extracted version to be incorrect.

### Bug:
The bug is in how the function extracts and formats the version from the output of the command. It doesn't strip the `"fish, version"` part from the output before using it in the formatted string.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the version is extracted to only include the version number without the additional text. We can do this by splitting the output on `,` and taking the second part, then stripping any leading or trailing spaces.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By applying this fix, the function will correctly extract the version number without the additional text, and the test should pass successfully.
