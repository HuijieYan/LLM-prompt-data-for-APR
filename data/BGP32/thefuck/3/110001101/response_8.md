The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect handling of the output from the Popen process. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is being called before waiting for the process to finish, leading to incorrect or incomplete output. 

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to complete before reading its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then return a tuple containing the stdout and stderr outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly captures the output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and returns the expected result.
