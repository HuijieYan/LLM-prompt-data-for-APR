### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is meant to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, based on the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the `proc` object is actually a MagicMock object, likely indicating that the subprocess call did not execute as expected or encountered an error.

### Bug Cause
The `Popen` call might not be executing the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly, leading to the `proc` object not containing the expected output. This could be due to incorrect arguments passed to `Popen` or possible issues in the execution environment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the command passed to `Popen` and ensure it is correct for retrieving the Fish shell version.
2. Verify that the subprocess is executing without errors by checking the return code or any exception raised.
3. Ensure that the output is properly captured from the subprocess.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any errors that might occur during the subprocess execution
            return 'Fish Shell (version not available)'
``` 

In the corrected version, we added error handling using a try-except block to capture any exceptions that might occur during the subprocess execution. Additionally, we replaced `proc.stdout.read()` with `proc.communicate()[0]` to properly capture the output from the subprocess. If any errors occur, the function will return a default message indicating the version is not available.
