### Bug Explanation
The issue with the buggy function is that when trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the output returned includes the text "fish, version" along with the actual version number. This causes the `version` variable to hold a string that includes this extra text, which is not the expected format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output of the command. Instead of directly using the output of the command, we should parse it to extract only the version number.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()[8:]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

Now the corrected version of the function should properly extract only the version number from the output of the command and return it.
