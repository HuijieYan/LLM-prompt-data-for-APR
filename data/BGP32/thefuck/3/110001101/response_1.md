## Analysis
The bug in the provided function lies in how the version information is being extracted from the output of the command. The return value of `echo $FISH_VERSION` will include the text `fish, version` along with the actual version number. However, the expected output only requires the version number without the prefix `fish, version`. 

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by including the `Fish Shell` prefix in the return value along with the version number. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output values.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output and return it without any additional text.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(", version ")[-1]  # Extract version number only
        return version
```

By splitting the `version` string and keeping only the last part (the version number), we ensure that the function returns just the version number without any additional text. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected output values.
