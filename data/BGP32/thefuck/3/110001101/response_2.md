### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function lies in the way the version string is extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function currently returns the entire string `'fish, version ...'` instead of just the version number. This discrepancy results in the incorrect output.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function fails to extract only the version number from the shell command output. It retains the entire string `'fish, version ...'` when it should return just the version number.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted from the command output. We should extract only the version number portion of the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, the `version` variable now extracts the version number by splitting the output string and taking the second part (the version number) after the comma ','. This modification ensures that only the version number is returned, as expected.
