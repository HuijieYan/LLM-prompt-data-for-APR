## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `info` function is caused by calling `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to reading an empty or partial output from the process. As a result, the `version` variable may not contain the expected value.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should wait for the process to finish before reading the output. We can achieve this by adding `proc.wait()` before reading from `proc.stdout`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
