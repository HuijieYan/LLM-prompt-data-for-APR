### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell but is not handling the `Popen` process correctly. The issue lies in the fact that `proc.stdout.read()` is being called before the process completes, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the function is trying to read the stdout of the `Popen` process before it has finished executing, resulting in empty or incomplete output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to complete before reading the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
       
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
