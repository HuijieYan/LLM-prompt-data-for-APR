### Analysis
The buggy function `info(self)` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. The issue arises from how the version string is being extracted and formatted, resulting in unexpected characters in the output. The function is extracting the version string along with other unnecessary characters.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the version string extracted from the shell command output. The function is not correctly parsing the version string and is including unnecessary characters in the final output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted and formatted. We should ensure that only the version number is captured without any additional characters or whitespaces.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version number
        version = version.split(", version ")[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version of the function extracts the version number string by splitting the original string at ", version " and keeping only the last part. This ensures that only the version number is included in the final output without any unnecessary characters.
