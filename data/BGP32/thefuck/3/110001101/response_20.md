The bug in the provided function `info()` is likely caused by not properly handling the output of the `Popen` process before trying to decode it. 

The corrected version should read the output of the process using the `communicate()` method instead of directly calling `read()` on `proc.stdout`. This will ensure that the output is properly read and decoded.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected class with the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()[0]` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the output of the process is properly obtained and decoded.

This corrected version should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it as expected.
