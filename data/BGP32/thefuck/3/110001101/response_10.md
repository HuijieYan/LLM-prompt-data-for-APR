### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in Fish shell. However, the issue lies in how the output is being processed. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is being called without waiting for the process to finish, causing incorrect results to be returned.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not waiting for the process to finish before reading its output. This leads to incorrect version information being extracted.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading its output. We can achieve this by using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # Corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
