### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the expected version number is '3.5.9' but the retrieved version is 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
2. The failing test is setting the `side_effect` of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', which is causing the discrepancy in version comparison.
3. The bug is causing the assertion error due to the mismatch in the expected version string and the retrieved version string.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version is extracted from the output.
5. The expected format for the version extraction is 'fish, version 3.5.9'. We can split the string by ' ' and take the last element to get the version number.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, we are now correctly extracting the version number '3.5.9' from the output and formatting it to match the expected format 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This should resolve the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to the hanging initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
