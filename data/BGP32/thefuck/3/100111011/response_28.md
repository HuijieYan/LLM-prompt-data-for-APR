### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the expected version output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while the actual output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy causes the assertion error.

The error message clearly shows the difference between the expected output and the actual output. The failing test sets the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, implying that the correct expected version should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue related to this bug refers to a situation where the use of the `-v` flag hangs the Fish Shell due to a recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` and the `info` method in the `fish.py` file.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is not correctly extracting the version number of the Fish shell. It is assuming that the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` will provide only the version number, but in this case, it is providing additional text that needs to be parsed correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract and format the version number from the command output. Specifically, we should extract only the version number from the output and format it in the correct way to match the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    version = version_output.splitlines()[0]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We run `fish -v` to get the version information directly.
- We extract the version number by splitting the output correctly based on `', version '` and removing any additional text.
- Finally, we format the extracted version number appropriately to match the expected output.
