### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project tries to get the Fish Shell version by executing a command through `Popen`. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets the expected output version as `Fish Shell 3.5.9`, but the actual output is `Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`.

### Identifying potential error locations
- The command being executed in `Popen` might not be correct.
- The decoding or stripping process of the version could be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug
The version extraction logic in the `info` function is not parsing the Fish Shell version correctly. The function reads the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which yields the version string along with additional information that causes the mismatch in the test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed to retrieve only the version string without any additional information. Additionally, we must ensure the decoding and stripping process accurately captures the version.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting only the version part
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version should accurately capture the Fish Shell version without any additional information, resolving the mismatch in the test.
