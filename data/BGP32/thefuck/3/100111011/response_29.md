### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`, which causes the incorrect version string to be extracted and formatted.

### Cause of the Bug:
The failing test `test_info` sets the side effect for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, but the `info` function is trying to extract the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, resulting in `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, leading to the assertion failure.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix involves changing the command used to obtain the Fish version from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version`, ensuring that the correct version string is retrieved and formatted for the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
``` 

In the corrected version, the `info` function will use the `fish --version` command to retrieve the correct version information and format it correctly as `'Fish Shell X.X.X'`. This change should make the function return the expected version string and pass the failing test.
