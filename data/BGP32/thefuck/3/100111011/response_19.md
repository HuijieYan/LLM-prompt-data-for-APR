## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using `Popen`. However, the expected output is not being returned as the version string also includes additional information that needs to be parsed.

In the failing test, the expected version string is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. Still, due to the incorrect parsing of the version output in the `info` function, the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, leading to the assertion error.

The `Popen` call in the `info` function is pointing to the wrong command (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'`), which further compounds the issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `Popen` call in the `info` function to execute the correct command `'fish --version'` to retrieve the Fish shell version information.
2. Parse the output of the command to extract only the version number without additional text.
3. Update the test case to match the corrected output format.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `Popen` call has been updated to use `'fish --version'` to retrieve the version information.
- The output is split by commas and whitespace, extracting only the version number.
- The return statement formats the version number appropriately.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now accurately retrieve and format the Fish shell version information, passing the failing test.
