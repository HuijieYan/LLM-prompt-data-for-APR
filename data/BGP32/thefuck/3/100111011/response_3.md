### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the version to be obtained using `fish --version`, leading to a mismatch in the obtained version string.
2. The test is setting the return value of `Popen` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function reads this value using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which results in the version being `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, causing the assertion to fail.
3. The GitHub issue refers to a recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` causing a hang during Fish Shell initialization due to this discrepancy in how the version is retrieved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version in the `info` function to `fish --version`.
2. Adjust the test case to expect the version obtained with `fish --version`.
3. Ensure that the corrected function conforms to the expected behavior from the test and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `fish --version` and parsing the version string appropriately from the output, the corrected function will now return the Fish Shell version in the expected format.
