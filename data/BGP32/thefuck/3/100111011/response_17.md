### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` script is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the command being executed is incorrect.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` is asserting that the `info` function should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
3. The error message indicates that the returned version string is not formatted correctly.
4. The cause of the bug is due to the command executed in `info` function not returning the version string in the expected format.
5. To fix the bug, the command executed by `Popen` should be changed to `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Bug Fix
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By changing the command to `fish --version`, we can accurately fetch the version information and format it correctly for the output.
