### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the command used to retrieve the version of Fish shell. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not be returning the expected value, leading to the mismatch in the version comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the output actually contains additional text like `"fish, version 3.5.9"`. This additional text causes the version comparison to fail, leading to the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to extract the version of the Fish shell. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we can directly query the version using `fish --version` command to ensure that only the version number is captured.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By making this change, we are directly retrieving the version of Fish shell without any additional text, allowing for a successful comparison in the test function.
