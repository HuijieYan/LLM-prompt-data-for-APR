### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not return just the version number but also other information.
2. The comparison in the test function might not be correctly formatted to match the version extracted from the shell command output.
3. The shell command used to retrieve the Fish shell version might need adjustment.

### Cause of the Bug:
The error occurs because the extracted version from the shell command includes unnecessary information, leading to a mismatch in the comparison. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns additional text that is not required for just the version number.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the shell command in the `info` function to specifically target the version number only.
2. Adjust the comparison in the test function to match the version extracted correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the shell command used is `['fish', '--version']`, which explicitly retrieves the version number without any other unnecessary text. The version extracted is split and the last element is considered as the version number. This change ensures that only the version is extracted and returned.
