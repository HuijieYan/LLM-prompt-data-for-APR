### Analyzation
The buggy function `info` in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file tries to get the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test case `test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` is setting the expected shell version to 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which causes a failure. The error message indicates that the actual output is not formatted correctly.

The key issue seems to be how the version is extracted within the `info` function.

### Bug Cause
The `info` function in `thefuck/shells/fish.py` is extracting the version from the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, whereas the test case in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` is expecting 'Fish Shell <version>'. This mismatch in formatting causes the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the command used to get Fish shell version to 'fish --version'.
2. Format the extracted version string as 'Fish Shell <version>'.
3. Adjust the test case's expectation to match this format.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Make sure to update the test case as well:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected test file: tests/shells/test_fish.py

def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

With these corrections, the function should properly extract the Fish shell version and format it correctly to match the expected output in the test case.
