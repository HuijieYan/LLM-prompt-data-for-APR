### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output values.
2. The test function provided in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock Popen object to simulate the command output, but the command being checked within the function does not match the setup.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output includes unnecessary text "fish, version" instead of just the version number.
4. To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to provide the correct format.
5. Modifying the `info` function to utilize the correct command to extract the version information and adjust the comparison in the test function will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

In this corrected version, the command to get the Fish shell version is updated to `['fish', '--version']`, which should return the version number directly without any unnecessary text. The function then extracts just the version number from the output for a clean comparison.

By applying this correction, the function should now return the correct version format, aligning with the expectation in the test function.
