## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish Shell by executing a command. However, the implemented command and the way the output is read might be causing the bug.
2. The test function `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file sets up a scenario where a specific output is expected upon calling the `info` function.
3. The bug seems to arise from incorrect handling of the command output and validation of the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command executed to get the Fish Shell version is correct and that the output is being processed and interpreted accurately.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `info` function lies in the command being executed to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The current command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` might not always return the version number as expected, leading to incorrect information being returned. This discrepancy causes the failing test scenario to not match the expected output.

The failing test provides specific output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, so we need to adjust the command and how we extract the version information from it.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version and properly process the output to extract the version number. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we modify the command to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure we get the version information directly. Then, we split the output by spaces and extract the version number using index 2, based on the known format of the Fish Shell version output.

This fix should address the bug and make the `info` function return the expected output, resolving the failing test scenario.
