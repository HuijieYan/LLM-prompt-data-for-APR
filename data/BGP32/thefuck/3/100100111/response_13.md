### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file attempts to get the version of Fish Shell using the `$FISH_VERSION` variable, but the command used (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) doesn't match with what the test case is expecting (`fish --version`).
2. The bug is caused because the command used to fetch the Fish Shell version doesn't return the expected output for the test case.
3. The `info` function should be modified to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By updating the command in the Popen call to `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version from the output appropriately, the corrected function should now return the correct Fish Shell version when called.
