## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test mocks the `Popen` object and sets it to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. However, the function expects `FISH_VERSION` variable.
3. The cause of the bug is that the command executed in the `Popen` call is not returning the correct version format, which is `FISH_VERSION` instead of just the version number.
4. We need to modify the command executed in the `Popen` call to properly retrieve the `FISH_VERSION` variable from the Fish shell environment.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command executed in the `Popen` call to retrieve the `FISH_VERSION` variable.
2. Modify the function to extract just the version number from the retrieved output.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1].replace('\n', '')
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected function will properly extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This updated version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
