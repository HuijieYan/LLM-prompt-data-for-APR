## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is using the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version. Additionally, the test is expecting the command `['fish', '--version']` to be called instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This mismatch in commands is causing the test to fail.

## Bug Explanation
The `info` function is trying to get the Fish shell version by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the test is mocking a response for `['fish', '--version']`. This mismatch in commands is leading to the test failing because the expected version string is not being retrieved from the command output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expectation of the test. By doing this, we ensure that the correct Fish shell version is extracted and compared in the test.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command `['fish', '--version']` is passed to `Popen` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. The output of the command is then split by spaces to extract the version information separately, which is used to construct the return string. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
