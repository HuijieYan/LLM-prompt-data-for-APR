## Analysis
1. The function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by invoking a subprocess to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the version extraction logic seems to be incorrect.
2. The test function `test_info` sets the expected output of `shell.info()` to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current implementation does not extract the version correctly.
3. The current implementation reads the output of the subprocess directly using `proc.stdout.read()`, which might cause issues due to incomplete data being read or encoding problems.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the logic in this function might cause unexpected behavior due to recursive calls or hanging during Fish Shell initialization.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function fails to correctly extract the version from the output of the subprocess command. This may lead to incorrect information being returned. Additionally, the GitHub issue hints at a potential problem with recursive calls or hanging during Fish Shell initialization.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for extracting the version from the subprocess output. We should ensure that the output is correctly read and decoded. Additionally, we need to address any potential issues related to recursive calls or shell initialization problems described in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function now reads the output of the subprocess line by line and decodes it correctly. This should address the version extraction issue. Additionally, further investigation and modification might be necessary to address any potential recursive calls or hanging during initialization as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
