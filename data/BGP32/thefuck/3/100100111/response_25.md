The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is not extracting the version number correctly from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The `test_info` test function expects the version number to be '3.5.9' as seen in the test data provided.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to extract the version number is incorrect, causing the function to return an incorrect value. Instead of capturing the exact version number from the output, it just captures 'fish, version 3.5.9\n'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to extract the version number and update the function accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We changed `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly fetch the version number of Fish shell.
- We modified the line to extract the version number correctly from the output by splitting the string and selecting the appropriate index. This ensures that only the version number is captured.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as mentioned in the test data.
