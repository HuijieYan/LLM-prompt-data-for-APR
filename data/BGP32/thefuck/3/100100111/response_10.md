After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the potential error location in the `info` function. The issue arises from the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version not being correct, leading to incorrect version extraction. The root cause of the bug is the incorrect command used to obtain the shell version (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`).

To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version. By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']`, we can ensure that the correct version information is extracted.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will properly extract the Fish shell version, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue. The corrected function will now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
