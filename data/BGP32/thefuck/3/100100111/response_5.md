## Analysis
The buggy `info` function is attempting to get the Fish shell version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, but in the failing test, the expected command is `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the command being run is the primary cause of the bug.

Additionally, based on the expected values and types during the failing test execution, it seems like the function is not correctly handling the `proc` object and its sub-attributes, leading to the test failure.

## Bug Cause
1. Incorrect shell command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Improper handling of the `proc` object and its attributes.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the shell command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Properly handle the `proc` object and its `stdout` attribute to retrieve the correct version string.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the Fish shell version. It then properly handles the `proc` object to extract the version string by splitting the output and extracting the version number.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
