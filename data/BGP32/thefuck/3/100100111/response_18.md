## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `info` attempts to read the version of the Fish Shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test case expects the version to be extracted by running `fish --version`, which results in a discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior of the function.

### Error Location:
The error in the implementation stems from the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The function `info` uses `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test expects the version to be fetched with `fish --version`.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test sets up an expectation for the command to be `fish --version`, but the function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to fetch the version. This mismatch leads to the test failing as it does not encounter the command it expects in the function's execution. 

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the command in the `Popen` call to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(" ")[2])
```

The corrected function now executes `fish --version` to fetch the version of the Fish Shell, aligning with the expectations of the failing test case. It properly extracts the version from the output and returns the formatted version string.
