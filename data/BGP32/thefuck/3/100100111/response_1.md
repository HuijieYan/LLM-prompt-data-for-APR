### Buggy Function Analysis:
- The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically the Fish shell version.
- The function uses `Popen` to execute a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the Fish shell version.
- The expected return value format is 'Fish Shell <version>'.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is in the command being executed using `Popen`, which currently is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This command does not match the expected command `['fish', '--version']` which the test is checking for.

### Bug Explanation:
- When the function is called, it tries to read the output from `proc.stdout` assuming it contains the Fish shell version.
- However, the command executed using `Popen` does not provide the version in the desired format ('Fish, version X.X.X').
- This leads to incorrect return value extraction, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the command executed using `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected version output. This will ensure that the correct version string is extracted and formatted as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will execute `['fish', '--version']` to obtain the version information in the correct format and return 'Fish Shell <version>'. This should pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values.
