### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in `fish.py` uses the `Popen` class to run a command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the command being used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) is different from the one being checked in the test function (`['fish', '--version']`).

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The command being used to retrieve the version might be incorrect.
2. Reading the version information from the command output might be unreliable.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug exists because the command used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not provide the desired output format, causing incorrect version retrieval. Additionally, the test function expects the version to be retrieved using `['fish', '--version']`, leading to a failure. 

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the test expectations.
2. Ensure that the version retrieval from the command output is correctly handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The command in `Popen` has been updated to `['fish', '--version']`.
- The output parsing logic has been updated to extract the version correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
