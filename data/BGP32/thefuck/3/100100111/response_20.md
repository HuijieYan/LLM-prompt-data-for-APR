## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, the command to fetch the Fish version is incorrect.
2. The failing test is checking for the correct version string to be returned and the command used in the subprocess call.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being used to fetch the Fish version instead of `fish --version`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the subprocess call to `['fish', '--version']`.

## Updated and Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the fix as described above, the corrected function should now return the expected Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
