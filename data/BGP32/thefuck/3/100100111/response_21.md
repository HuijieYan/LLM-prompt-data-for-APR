## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by executing a command. However, it reads the output incorrectly and does not use the correct command to retrieve the version.

2. The potential error locations are in the command to get the Fish version and how the output is being processed.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect command usage to retrieve the Fish version as 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which is not the correct way to get the version. Additionally, the expected version format is also incorrect ('version 3.5.9' instead of '3.5.9'). This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output, causing the failing test.

4. To fix the bug, the correct command to get the Fish version should be used, and the output processing should be adjusted to extract just the version number without any extra information.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `fish.py` file:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and properly process the output to match the expected format.
