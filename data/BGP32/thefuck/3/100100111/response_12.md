## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but is expecting the output to be in the format of `fish, version X.X.X`. However, the actual output format differs from what the function is expecting, causing the test to fail.

Additionally, the test case is setting the side effect of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to provide `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` in order to simulate the output of the shell command for testing. However, the function is looking for the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable to get the version.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the function `info` is retrieving the Fish shell version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which may not always return the expected version string directly. It may return the version in a different format or might not be set in some cases leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the test case is not aligning with the command used to retrieve the version in the `info` function, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the command used to retrieve the shell version inside the `info` function to be `fish --version` for consistent output. Also, modify the test case to set the side effect accordingly to provide `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` matching the expected output format.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split()[-1]
    version = version.strip(',')
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly extract the shell version from the `fish --version` command output, addressing the bug and making the test case pass.
