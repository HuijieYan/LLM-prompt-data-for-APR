## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is supposed to return the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the command being executed is incorrect (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`), leading to incorrect output and failing the test.

## Error Locations
1. The command being executed in `Popen` is incorrect (`echo $FISH_VERSION`).
2. The test case expects the version to be fetched using `fish --version`, but the function actually fetches it differently.

## Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is the incorrect command being executed to fetch the Fish Shell version. The function is not returning the expected version format (`Fish Shell x.x.x`). This incorrect implementation is causing the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Modify the command executed by `Popen` to `fish --version`.
2. Adjust the function to read and parse the correct output to extract the version in the correct format.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function:

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().strip().decode('utf-8')
    version_parts = version.split(', version ')[1].split('.')
    version_string = '.'.join(version_parts[:3])
    return f'Fish Shell {version_string}'
```

The corrected function now executes `fish --version` to get the correct version string, splits it to get only the version number, and then formats it as `Fish Shell x.x.x`. This should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
