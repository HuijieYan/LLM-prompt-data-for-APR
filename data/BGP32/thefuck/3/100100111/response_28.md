## Analysis
1. The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess that executes `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The expected output format is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
3. The related test is mocking the subprocess output to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' and checking if the function returns the correct version and if the subprocess call is made correctly.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights a problem where the `thefuck -v` command hangs Fish Shell initialization due to a recursive loop caused by the `Fish.info()` function.
5. The current function does not provide the expected output and is using `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'` to get the version number.

## Bug
The bug in the current implementation is in the subprocess command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Instead of running `fish --version`, it is running `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which does not provide the correct version information.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen command to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to correctly retrieve the version of Fish shell.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

By modifying the Popen command to run `fish --version`, the corrected function will fetch the correct version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected output.
