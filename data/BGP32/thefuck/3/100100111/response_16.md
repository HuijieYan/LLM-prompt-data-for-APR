### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info` in the `fish.py` file, which is expected to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The issue lies in reading the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` which causes the function to hang.
3. The failing test sets up a mock response for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. However, the function's code tries to read the version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which causes the function to hang without consuming the mock response correctly.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the command sent to Popen to directly call `fish --version` instead of trying to read the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable.
2. Modify the function to capture the version information correctly by parsing the output of `fish --version` command.

### Corrected Version of the `info` Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By utilizing `fish --version` command directly, the corrected function retrieves the version information accurately without causing a hang.
