### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test provides a mock output for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read`, simulating the command `fish --version`.
3. The bug occurs due to the mismatch between the command executed in `info` and the command expected in the test.
4. The expected value in the test is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, which should be derived from the command `fish --version`.

### Bug Cause:
The `info` function attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version using the wrong command (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) instead of the correct command (`fish --version`). This discrepancy leads to incorrect parsing of the version information and leads to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Parse the output of `Popen` to extract the version information correctly.
3. Ensure the return statement formats the version information as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

After applying the fix above, the `info` function should now correctly extract the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command and format it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop in Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.
