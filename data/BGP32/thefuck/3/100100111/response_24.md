## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with test code

The buggy function, `info`, is designed to return the name and version of the current shell, which in this case is the Fish shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command to get the Fish shell version and then formats and returns it. The failing test provided attempts to mock the output of the `Popen` call to simulate the retrieval of the Fish shell version and expects the function to return the formatted version string.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The command passed to `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. The expected command should be `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Reading the output of `proc.stdout.read()` is done before checking if the `proc` process has completed.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is two-fold:
1. The command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to the function not obtaining the correct version information.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` directly without checking if the process has completed can result in incorrect or empty output.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Ensure that we wait for the process to complete before reading from `proc.stdout`.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Parsing the version information from the output
    version_lines = version_output.splitlines()
    version = None
    for line in version_lines:
        if line.startswith('fish, version'):
            version = line.split()[-1]
    
    if version is None:
        return "Fish Shell version information not found"
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and ensures that it waits for the process to complete before reading from `proc.stdout`. It then parses the version information from the output and returns it in the required format.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test case and provide the correct version information for the Fish shell.
