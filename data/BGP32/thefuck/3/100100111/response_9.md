## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in `fish.py` is intended to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test function `test_info` in `test_fish.py` expects the shell version to be obtained using `fish --version`, which is different from what the `info()` function is currently doing. This inconsistency is causing the failing test case.

## Issue
The main issue causing the failing test case is that the `info()` function is retrieving the Fish shell version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` command while the test function expects it to be obtained through `fish --version`. This discrepancy leads to the failing test and does not accurately reflect the functionality intended by the test case.

## Potential Error Location
The root cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the `info()` function. It should use the command `fish --version` to fetch the Fish shell version, but it is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `info()` function to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This change will align the function with the test case's expectation and ensure that the correct Fish shell version is retrieved.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the `info()` function will now fetch the Fish shell version using `fish --version`, which matches the expectation of the failing test and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
