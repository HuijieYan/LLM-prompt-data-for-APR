### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the Fish Shell by executing a command.
2. The `info` function uses `Popen` to run a command to get the Fish Shell version.
3. The test function in `test_fish.py` mocks the `Popen` output to simulate the command result and checks if the function returns the correct version.
4. The current implementation does not match the expected output, leading to a failing test.
5. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `-v` flag causes a recursive loop due to incorrect behavior in the `info` function.

### Bug Cause:
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This causes the function to fetch incorrect version information and fail to meet the test's expectation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `info` function should run the correct command `fish --version` to fetch the Fish Shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After making these changes and running the test again, the corrected function should return the correct Fish Shell version and pass the test successfully.
