### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function is using `Popen` to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell.
2. The function reads the output from stdout using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.
3. The expected version string format is 'fish, version 3.5.9', but the function needs to extract '3.5.9' from this string.
4. The assertion compares the formatted version with the expected version 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which does not match due to the extraction issue.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug originates from the function not correctly extracting the version number from the output string 'fish, version 3.5.9'. As a result, the formatted version returned by the function does not match the expected version 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to extract only the version number from the output string 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This can be achieved by parsing the string and extracting the version part using string manipulation or regex.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By splitting the version string at ', version ' and taking the second part, the corrected function correctly extracts the version number '3.5.9' from the output string 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This fix ensures that the formatted version returned by the function matches the expected version 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
