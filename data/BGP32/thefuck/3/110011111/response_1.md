Based on the analysis, the issue in the buggy function lies in the way it extracts the version information from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The output contains unnecessary text that is not part of the version number, leading to the assertion failure in the test.

To fix this, the function should extract only the version number from the output and return it in the correct format. The correction involves modifying the string manipulation to get the version without any additional text.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[2]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the corrected function now correctly extracts only the version number from the output of the command and formats it as expected. This modification ensures that the function returns the correct version number, resolving the assertion failure in the test.
