### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the current implementation is not correctly extracting the version number which causes the test to fail.
   
2. The test is expecting a version number without any additional text such as 'fish, version'. The output should just be the version number.

3. The failing test shows that the output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This discrepancy is causing the assertion error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly parsing the version number, including unnecessary text which leads to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy:
The function should be modified to extract only the version number from the output without any additional text. This can be done by splitting the output string and selecting the segment that contains the version number.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string and selecting the correct index corresponding to the version number, the function will now return the version number only. This correction should make the function provide the expected output and pass the failing test.
