### Analysis
1. The buggy function in the `Fish` class within `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell but does not handle the output correctly, resulting in the version string containing unnecessary characters.
2. The error message shows that the assertion fails due to the incorrect output format of the version string.
3. The function currently returns `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the expected `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to extract only the version number from the output and return it in the correct format.
5. The corrected version should process the version string to extract the version number without additional characters.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction extracts only the version number from the output by splitting the string and taking the last element, ensuring that only the version digits are included in the final output.
