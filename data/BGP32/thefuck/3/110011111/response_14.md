### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the `FISH_VERSION` by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the output includes unwanted text like `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
   
2. The test failure indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output includes the additional 'fish, version' text, causing the assertion error.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function is not parsing the correct version string and returning it with the desired formatting.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to extract the version number from the output of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of returning the entire string.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extracting only the version number without 'fish, version'
        version_number = version.split()[2] if version.startswith('fish, version') else version
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
``` 

Now the corrected function should properly extract and format the version number from the output of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, leading to the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
