### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command. The bug causes the returned version string to include unwanted text before the actual version number, leading to test failures.

The error message shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy indicates that the version string retrieved from the command output is not being parsed correctly.

The `Popen` object is mocked in the failing test, and the value `'fish, version 3.5.9'` is being returned by `proc.stdout.read()` during the test execution.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not correctly parsing the output of the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. It seems that the command is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which includes additional text before the version number.

The function reads this output and includes the additional text in the final formatted string, leading to the mismatch with the expected result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to parse the version number correctly from the output of the command. We can use string manipulation or regex to extract the version number '3.5.9' from the output 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function that correctly extracts the version number:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

This corrected version parses the version number by splitting the version string at ', version ' and taking the second part, ensuring that only the version number is included in the returned string.
