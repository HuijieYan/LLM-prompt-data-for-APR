### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell using a subprocess call to the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.
2. The error occurs because the returned value from the subprocess call includes extra information that is not expected.
3. The runtime values show that the version extracted from the subprocess call contains the extra "fish, version" text, causing the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version value from the subprocess call and remove the unwanted text.
5. The corrected version of the function should strip the unwanted text from the version extracted before returning.

### Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[-1]  # Extract version from output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version output and taking the last part after the comma, we effectively remove the unwanted "fish, version" text, ensuring that only the version number is returned by the `info` function.
