## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file.
2. The function tries to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`.
3. The error message shows that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output includes the wrong text 'fish, version'.
4. The issue on GitHub indicates a problem with the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly extracting only the version number from the output of the command. It includes unwanted text like 'fish, version' in the final output which causes the assertion error.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the `Popen` command instead of directly using the entire output.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
``` 

By splitting the `version` string on commas and then taking the second part, we can isolate the version number and return the correct output.
