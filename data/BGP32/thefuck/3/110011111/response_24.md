## Bug Fix Strategy
In the buggy function `info`, the issue arises from the incorrect formatting of the output version string. The version string retrieved from the `fish` shell includes additional text that needs to be removed before constructing the final output string. To fix the bug, modify the code to extract only the version number from the retrieved string before creating the final output.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[2]  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the retrieved version string and extracting the version number at index 2, we ensure that only the version number is used in constructing the final output string. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test, providing the expected output based on the provided runtime and expected variable values.
