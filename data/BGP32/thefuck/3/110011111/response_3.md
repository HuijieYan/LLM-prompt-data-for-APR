### Identified Bug in the Buggy Function
The cause of the bug in the provided function stems from the way the version number is retrieved from the output of the command executed. The `info` function is currently returning the entire output string, including the word "fish" and the comma, which causes the assertion to fail. The function should only return the version number without any additional text.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract just the version number from the output string and return it without any extra characters. This can be achieved by splitting the output string and extracting the version number specifically.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string using a comma as a delimiter and selecting the second part (the version number) after the split, we ensure that only the version number is returned by the `info` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
