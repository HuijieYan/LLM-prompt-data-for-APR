## Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class has a bug where it returns the full version string instead of just the version number.
   
2. **Error Message**: The assertion error is due to the mismatch between the actual output, which includes "fish, version", and the expected output, which should only contain the version number.
   
3. **Runtime Values**:
   - The `proc` variable is a MagicMock, indicating a mock object.
   - The `version` variable contains the full version string 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
   - The `proc.stdout.read` and `proc.stdout` variables are also MagicMock objects.

4. **Expected Values**:
   - The corrected function should return only the version number '3.5.9' without the 'fish, version' prefix.

5. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The reported issue mentions that the use of the `thefuck -v` command causes a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function. The fix for this issue is in progress.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to extract only the version number from the full version string obtained from the shell command output. This can be achieved by parsing the version string and extracting the relevant information.

## Corrected Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extracting only the version number
        version_number = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Split at the 'version ' prefix

        return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
``` 

By splitting the version string at ', version ', we can isolate and return only the version number without the unnecessary prefix. This corrected function should now provide the expected output for the test cases.
