### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. The expected output is `'Fish Shell <version>'`, where `<version>` is the actual version of the Fish shell.
2. The error occurs because the output from the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` call includes additional text "fish, version" before the actual version number, causing the comparison to fail.
3. The error message and runtime values show that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the obtained output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that retrieves the version from the output of the command to properly extract just the version number without the additional preceding text.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_split = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_split)
```

By splitting the `version` string on `", version "`, we extract just the version number without the additional text. This modified version of the `info` function should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
