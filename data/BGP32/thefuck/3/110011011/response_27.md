### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the function is not correctly parsing the output and formatting it.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between the expected output ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and the actual output ('Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9') is failing.
3. The runtime values show that the `version` variable is not correctly extracted from the output of the subprocess command. The issue on GitHub suggests that there might be an issue with recursive loop when using the `-v` flag, indicating that the `info` function might be causing such behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the parsing logic of the output from the subprocess command to extract only the version number and format it as expected.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the parsing logic to extract only the version number from the output string.
2. Format the extracted version number in the desired format ('Fish Shell x.x.x').

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract version number from the output string
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the `version` string on the comma and extracting the second part (`version.split(',')[1].strip()`), we can obtain only the version number. This corrected version should now correctly parse the version and format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.
