### Potential Error Locations
1. The way the output from stdout is read and decoded.
2. The formatting of the final return string.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `Fish.info()` function is caused by how the output from the `Popen` call is read and decoded. The function is expecting the version number only, but the output includes additional text (`'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`). This discrepancy results in the final formatted string being incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version number is extracted from the output of the `Popen` call. We should extract just the version number without any additional text and then format the final string accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_with_text = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_with_text.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract just the version number from the output of the `Popen` call and format the final string as `'Fish Shell {version}'`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
