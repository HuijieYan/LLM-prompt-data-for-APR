### Potential Error Locations
1. Reading the output from `proc.stdout`
2. Formatting the version string

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function attempting to format the version string by including the entire output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which includes additional text ("fish, version") along with the version number. This causes the assertion to fail as the expected and actual strings do not match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command and then format it properly for the return statement.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After implementing the above correction, the function will properly extract only the version number and format it without including the additional text. This should resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
