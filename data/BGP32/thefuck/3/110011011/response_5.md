### Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the output of this command includes the text `"fish, version"`, which is causing the mismatch in the assertion.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with the `thefuck -v` command, which suggests that the version output might contain extra text like `"fish, version"`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` might be returning additional text along with the version number.
2. The way the version is extracted and formatted in the return statement could be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` inside `info` function is returning extra text before the actual version number, leading to an assertion error.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to extract and format the version number correctly from the command output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extract version number after removing extra text
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the extracted version string and taking the second part after `", version "`, we can ensure that only the version number is used in the return statement. This correction should resolve the assertion error in the failing test.
