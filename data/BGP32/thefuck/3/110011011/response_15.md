### Analysis
The buggy function `info` tries to extract the version number of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. However, the issue arises from not properly decoding the output of the subprocess command, leading to an incorrect version extraction which causes the assertion to fail.

The `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` is simulated to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the buggy function reads this output as a string `'fish, version 3.5.9'` without handling the trailing newline character.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by failing to handle the trailing newline character in the output of the subprocess command. This discrepancy results in an incorrect comparison in the assertion, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the output of the subprocess command should be properly decoded while handling the trailing newline character, so that the extracted version number matches the expected format in the test.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace(',', '')  # Fix to remove commas
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
