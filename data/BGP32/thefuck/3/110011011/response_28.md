### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell.
2. The error message shows that the function is returning the version string with an extra "fish, version" prefix which is causing the assertion failure.
3. From the runtime values provided, it seems like the `proc.stdout.read()` function is returning the version string along with the unnecessary "fish, version" prefix, leading to the incorrect output.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to this bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command executed in the subprocess, which includes the "fish, version" text in the output. This extra text is not handled correctly, leading to the incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the parsing of the output from the `Popen` command to extract only the version number and remove the unnecessary "fish, version" text.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract the version number part from the output
        version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version output by the comma and selecting the second part, we can extract only the version number without the "fish, version" text. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
