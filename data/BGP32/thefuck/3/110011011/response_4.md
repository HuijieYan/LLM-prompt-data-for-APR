### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`, but it is not parsing the version correctly.
2. The error message indicates that the expected output for the `shell.info()` call is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. The failing test provides input parameters where `proc.stdout.read()` is mocked to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, leading to the mismatch in the expected and actual output.
4. The bug is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the version string from the command output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract the version number from the output before formatting it in the desired format.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_parts = version.split(', version ')
        if len(version_parts) > 1:
            version = version_parts[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string on `', version '`, we can extract the actual version number and use it to format the output correctly.

This fix should address the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue related to TheFuck plugin in the Fish Shell.
