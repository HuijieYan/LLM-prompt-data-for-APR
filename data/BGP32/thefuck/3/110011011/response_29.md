### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, Fish Shell.
2. The error message indicates an assertion failure where the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
3. The test provides a mocked `Popen` object that has a `stdout.read` method returning `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. The issue likely lies in the way the version information is extracted and formatted in the `info` function.
4. To fix this bug, we need to correctly extract the version information from the stdout and format it into 'Fish Shell x.x.x' before returning the string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the version information extracted from `proc.stdout.read()` is properly cleaned and formatted.
2. Strip any additional characters or spaces from the version string before formatting it as 'Fish Shell version'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the code to extract and format only the version number for the Fish Shell, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
