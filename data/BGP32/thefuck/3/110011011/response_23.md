### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class. It attempts to fetch the version of Fish shell by running a subprocess command and then formatting the output to return the version.
2. The error occurs in the test where the expected output is not matching the actual output due to the incorrect formatting of the version string retrieved from the subprocess.
3. The function is not correctly processing the output from the subprocess command, leading to the version string being extracted incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version string extracted from the subprocess output is cleaned up and formatted correctly before returning it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of the version string retrieved from the subprocess command. The function is not cleaning up the version string properly, leading to extra characters being included in the final output. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to clean up the version string obtained from the subprocess output by removing any unnecessary characters or whitespaces. This can be achieved by using proper string manipulation methods to extract only the relevant version information before formatting and returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version information
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, the extracted version string is cleaned up using `split` and `strip` methods to ensure only the version number is returned without any extra characters. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected output for the test cases.
