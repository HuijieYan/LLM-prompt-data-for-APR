### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess.
2. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output contains `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. From the runtime values provided, it can be observed that the current implementation is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the subprocess.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that running `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to this bug.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect parsing of the output obtained from the subprocess. The code is not properly handling the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'` to extract just the version number.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to correctly extract the version number from the output obtained from the subprocess. This can be achieved by splitting the output string on `,` and then extracting the version part.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the subprocess on `,` and then extracting the version number part, the corrected function will properly extract the version number from the output and return it in the expected format.
