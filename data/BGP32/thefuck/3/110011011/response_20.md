### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to extract the version of the Fish Shell using a subprocess. However, the output is not being processed correctly, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual shell version.
2. The error message shows the comparison between the expected shell version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and the actual one ('Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9') which indicates that the version extraction is incorrect.
3. The provided runtime values for the variables show that the `proc.stdout.read()` is a `MagicMock` object, and the `version` variable contains the incorrect version format.
4. The bug is likely occurring because the output of the subprocess is not being decoded properly, resulting in the incorrect version format. This could be due to the way the output is read from the subprocess.
5. To fix the bug, the output from the subprocess needs to be decoded correctly using the `communicate()` method instead of directly reading from `stdout`.

### Fixing the Bug
Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to read the output from the subprocess and then decoding it, we ensure that the version is extracted correctly. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected version of the Fish Shell.
