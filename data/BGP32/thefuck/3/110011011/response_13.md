### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell. However, the issue arises when trying to extract the version information from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The current implementation fails to properly extract and format the version information, causing the assertion error in the test case.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The error likely originates from how the version information is being extracted from the output of the process `proc`. The decoding and stripping operations may not be handling the output correctly, leading to the unexpected result in the assertion.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The failed test case provides the actual output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` as `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. The buggy function attempts to format this as `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the desired format is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. The incorrect extraction and formatting of the version string leads to the assertion error.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function should correctly process the version information obtained from the `proc` command. This involves decoding the output properly, extracting the version number, and formatting it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`. By ensuring the correct handling of the output, the function should return the expected result and pass the test case.

### Corrected Version of the `info` function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By modifying the `info` function to correctly extract and format the version number from the output, it should now return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected and pass the failing test.
