### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess with Popen, but the function fails to correctly format the output.
2. The error message shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual result is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. The failing test case provides input values and types for `proc` and `version`, which are mocks and a string respectively. The issue seems to be with how the version string is processed and formatted.
4. The GitHub issue reference indicates that the problem relates to a recursive loop when using the `-v` option in the thefuck plugin due to incorrect shell initialization.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `info` function needs to correctly parse the version string and format it as `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`. We need to extract the version number from the string obtained from the subprocess result.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        version_number = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]  # Extract version number from the string
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
``` 

This corrected version properly extracts and formats the version number from the output string obtained.
