### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess to execute `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The error occurs because the output of the subprocess is not processed correctly, causing the version string to be prefixed with `'fish, version'`.
3. The failing test shows that the actual output includes the additional prefix, causing the assertion to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the output of the subprocess is processed to extract only the version number without the additional text.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect processing of the output of the subprocess in the `info` function. The version extracted from the output includes the additional text `'fish, version'` which leads to a failed assertion in the test.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the way the version is extracted from the subprocess output and construct the final return string. We can modify the function as follows:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        
        version_line = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_line.replace('fish, version ', '')
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly extract just the version number from the subprocess output, leading to the correct return of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
