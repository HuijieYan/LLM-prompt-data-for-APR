### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the output is not parsed correctly, leading to an incorrect version string.
2. The error message indicates that the actual output from the command contains extra text (`fish, version`), causing the assertion to fail.
3. From the runtime values provided, it can be seen that the `version` variable is assigned `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, which is not the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, the output from the subprocess command needs to be cleaned up to extract just the version number.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess command.
2. Update the parsing logic to remove any unwanted text and extract the version number correctly.
3. Ensure the extracted version is used to construct the return string in the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract version number from the output
        version = output.split('version ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version should properly extract the version number and construct the return string in the expected format, resolving the issue with the failing test.
