### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is trying to fetch the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test code is expecting the version to be fetched using `fish --version`.
2. The failing test sets the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n`, which the current implementation is not handling correctly.
3. The bug is causing the assertion error because the returned version string is not in the expected format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to get the proper version string and modify the processing logic of that string in the `info` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Modify the parsing logic in the `info` function to extract the version from the correct format.
3. Ensure that the corrected version matches the expectations of the failing test.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extracting version from the correct format 'fish, version x.y.z\n'
    version = version_output.split('version ')[1].replace('\n', '')
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the above correction to the `info` function, the function now uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and properly parses the version string. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue highlighted in the GitHub ticket.
