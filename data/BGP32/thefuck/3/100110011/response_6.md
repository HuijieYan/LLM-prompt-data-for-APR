### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is trying to get the version of Fish Shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test `test_info` in `test_fish.py` is expecting the version to be retrieved using the `fish --version` command. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.
2. The error message shows that the expected output for the `info` function is different from the actual result.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to incorrect behavior in the `info` function. This is because the version retrieval method is not compatible with Oh-My-Fish plugin requirements.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function in `fish.py` to use the `fish --version` command to get the correct version format that the test expects.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the command in `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the Fish Shell version correctly.
2. Modified the extraction of the version to exclude the word "fish, " from the returned output to match the test expectation.

After applying these changes, the `info` function should now correctly get the Fish Shell version using the `fish --version` command and pass the test. The fix aligns with the requirements of the Oh-My-Fish plugin, resolving the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
