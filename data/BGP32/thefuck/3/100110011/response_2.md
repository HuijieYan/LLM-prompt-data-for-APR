### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the command used `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not match the output provided by the failing test.
2. The failing test expects the version to be extracted by calling `fish --version`.
3. The error message indicates the mismatch in the expected output of the `info` function.
4. To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to extract the version.
5. The GitHub issue also confirms that the fix is related to resolving a recursive loop issue by using the correct command for version retrieval.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The failing test expects the version to be extracted using `fish --version`, leading to a mismatch in the expected output.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the `info` function to use the correct command `fish --version` to extract the Fish shell version and resolve the mismatch in the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this adjustment, the `info` function now executes the correct command to extract the Fish shell version, aligning with the expectations of the failing test.
