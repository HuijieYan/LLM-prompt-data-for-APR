## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file expects the version to be extracted accurately and formatted as `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`.
3. The error message shows that the extracted version is incorrect, causing the assertion to fail.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that using the `-v` flag triggers a recursive loop due to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to fetch the Fish shell version. The expected version format in the test is `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`, but the actual version retrieved from the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not match this format.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to match the expected version format in the test. We should change the command to `'fish', '--version'` to get the version in the desired format.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this correction in the `info` function, the extracted version will match the expected format in the test, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
