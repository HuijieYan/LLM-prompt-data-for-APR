### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class from `fish.py` is attempting to get the version of Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command using `Popen`.
2. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the output of the command to be `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` and expecting it to be formatted as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The error message highlights that the actual output includes unnecessary text `fish` and a comma.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a recursive loop triggered by using `thefuck -v` because of the issue in `Fish.info()` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not return just the version number but also additional text like `fish, version`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to extract only the version number from the output of the command and then format it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_line = output.split(',')[-1].strip()
    version = version_line.split()[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

This corrected version will extract the version number from the command output and format it correctly.
