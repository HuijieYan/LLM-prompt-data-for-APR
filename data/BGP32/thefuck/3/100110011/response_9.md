## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of Fish Shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is setting up the `Popen` mock to return `fish, version 3.5.9\n`, causing a mismatch in the expected version number.
2. The error message shows that the actual returned value contains the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, which is different from the expected value `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and formatting it to match the expected format. The test is also setting the command to `['fish', '--version']` which conflicts with the actual command used in the `info` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to properly parse the output of the command and format it according to the expected format. We also need to ensure that the test sets up the mock `Popen` call with the correct command and expected output.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version number from the output of the command and format it as expected by the test.

By implementing this correction, the test should pass successfully based on the corrected behavior of the `info` function.
