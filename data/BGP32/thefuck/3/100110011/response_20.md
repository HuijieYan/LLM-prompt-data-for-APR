### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the test function, the expected output format is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, which is different from what the function is currently returning.
2. The test is setting the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, while the `info` function is reading the output using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, causing a mismatch.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the `shell.info()` call.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly read the shell version and format it as `'Fish Shell x.x.x'` to match the test expectation.
5. The `info` function should execute `['fish', '--version']` command to get the proper version output and format it using `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
``` 

By executing `['fish', '--version']` command, the correct version output will be obtained, allowing the function to properly extract the version number and format it accordingly. This fix will ensure that the `info` function returns the expected `'Fish Shell x.x.x'` format as required by the test.
