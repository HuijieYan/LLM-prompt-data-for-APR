### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the provided buggy function, the command being run is `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is incorrect.
2. The failing test is mocking the output of the command to be `fish, version 3.5.9\n` but the function is appending the incorrect output with "Fish Shell" prefixed to it.
3. The error message from the failing test clearly shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, indicating that the incorrect command is being executed leading to an incorrect output.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that this buggy function is causing a recursive loop issue when using Oh-My-Fish with TheFuck plugin.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call inside the `info` function to run `fish --version` to correctly capture the version of the Fish shell.
2. Modify the return statement in the `info` function to properly format and return the version information.
3. Update the test case to validate the correct version string after the fix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test Function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and the test should pass as expected.
