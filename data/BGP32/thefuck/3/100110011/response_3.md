### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, in the test code, the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` which is not matching the actual version output from the command execution.
2. The failing test is setting the side effect of `stdout.read` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which does not match the format expected by the function.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to extract the version information from the command output in a different format which causes the assertion error in the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to parse and extract the correct version information from the output of the executed command and format it accordingly to match the expected output in the test code.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extracting only the version part and formatting it correctly
    version = version_output.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test Function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

By updating the buggy function to correctly extract and format the Fish shell version from the command output, we ensure that the function passes the failing test and resolves the reported GitHub issue related to the recursive loop.
