### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is trying to get the version of Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`.
2. The failing test is mocking the output of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The failing assertion error indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with running `thefuck -v` involving `thefuck/shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version output in the `info` function. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns output like `fish, version 3.5.9`, but the function is not parsing it correctly to extract the version number.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
2. Refactor the function to handle different variations of the Fish shell version output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version_info.split(',')[1].strip() if ',' in version_info else version_info.split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly parse the output of `fish --version` command and return the expected version format.
