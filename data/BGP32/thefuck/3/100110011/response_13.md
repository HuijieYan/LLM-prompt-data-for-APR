### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` process. However, the expected output from the test is `fish, version 3.5.9` whereas the current implementation does not match this format.
2. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the `Popen` process to return the expected output when `shell.info()` is called. The assertion error occurs when comparing the output of `shell.info()` with the expected version.
3. The bug causes the failing assertion error because the `info` function is not handling the `stdout` output correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected version and the actual output. This results in the assertion error in the test case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly parse and format the version output of Fish shell before returning it as `Fish Shell <version>`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the `Popen` command to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that we fetch the correct version output. Then by splitting the output based on the comma and stripping the version number, we can correctly format the version before returning `Fish Shell <version>`. This correction should resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
