### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `fish` shell is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock response for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The failing assertion error occurs because the expected output includes the string `fish,` which is not supposed to be included in the version output.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the `thefuck -v` command hangs due to recursive behavior caused by a bug in the `fish.py` file.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `info` function is that it directly invokes `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the response contains unwanted text (`fish,`) in addition to the version number. This causes the failing test assertion since it expects only the version number.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the response processing logic in the `info` function to extract only the version number from the command output. This can be achieved by updating how the `stdout` of the `Popen` command is processed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[-1]  # Extract only version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `info` function will only extract the version number from the command output, ensuring that the unwanted text is removed. This fix should make the function work correctly and pass the failing test.
