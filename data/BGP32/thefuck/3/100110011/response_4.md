### Bug Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the version of the Fish Shell, but it fetches the version using an incorrect command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) which may not give the expected version string.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` expects the version string to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the buggy function returns a different format.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is using the wrong command to get the version of Fish Shell. The test case is checking for a specific version format which is not being returned by the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the command used by `Popen` to get the Fish Shell version.
2. Update the `test_info` test case to match the expected version format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the `info` function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Updated version of the failing test
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With this correction, the `info` function now correctly fetches the version of the Fish Shell using `fish --version` command and the test case verifies the expected version format `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
