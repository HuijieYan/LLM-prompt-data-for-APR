### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, it should be querying for the version using `fish --version`.
2. The failing test is checking for the version number in the output of the `info` function, which is currently incorrect due to the mismatch in the command used to fetch the version.
3. The failing test is asserting the expected version number 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' with the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy is due to the incorrect command used to fetch the version. The GitHub issue also points out the recursive loop caused by this bug.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the command used in the `Popen` call within the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Solution:
```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the command used to fetch the Fish shell version in the `info` function, we can resolve the bug and make the function return the correct version string. It will also ensure that the failing test passes successfully.
