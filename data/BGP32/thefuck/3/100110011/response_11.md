1. Analyzing the provided buggy function `info` in `fish.py` and the failing test in `test_fish.py`, we can see that the function is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by running a command. However, the test is expecting a specific format for the version string, which is causing the assertion error.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The command used to get the version may not return the expected format.
   - The decoding of the output and stripping might be incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug lies in the discrepancy between the expected version format in the test and the actual output returned by the command. The test expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the function returned 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', leading to an assertion error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to get the Fish Shell version and ensure that the output is correctly decoded and formatted to match the expected result in the test.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- I modified the command to `['fish', '--version']` to get the version information directly.
- I split the version string based on `', version '`, so we extract only the version number itself.
- The return format is adjusted to match the expected format in the test.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub reference provided.
