### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and extracting the version number from the output.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets the expected version to 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output from the `info` function includes additional text ("fish, version"). This discrepancy between the expected and actual output triggers the assertion error.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish plugin leads to a recursive loop due to the buggy behavior in `info`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the command used in the `Popen` call (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) does not return the exact version number alone, but includes additional text like "fish, version".

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version number is extracted from the output of the command so that only the version number is considered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the full version information. Then, we split the output by `,` and get the second part which contains the version number only.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub thread.
