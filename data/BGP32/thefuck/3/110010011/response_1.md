### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The subprocess command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is used to get the version, but the output is not being handled correctly which leads to an incorrect version extraction.
   
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the extracted version is not matching the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9' vs 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9').
   
3. The GitHub issue states that the usage of the `thefuck -v` command in Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the output of the subprocess command in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The output of the command is read using `proc.stdout.read()` which results in a byte string that includes unnecessary text like 'fish, version' which causes the version comparison to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the output of the subprocess command needs to be decoded correctly to obtain only the version number without any unnecessary text. This can be achieved by decoding the byte string properly and extracting only the version number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version, the byte string output from the subprocess command is properly decoded and trimmed to extract only the version number. This will ensure that the `info` function returns the correct version format ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') as expected by the test case.
