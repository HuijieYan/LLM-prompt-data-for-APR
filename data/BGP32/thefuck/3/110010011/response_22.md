1. Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using a subprocess call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the output read from the subprocess is not being correctly processed, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

2. Error Location:
The error seems to be related to how the output from the subprocess is read and processed.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by improper handling of the output from the subprocess call. The `info` function is expecting the output to be just the version number without any additional text ("fish, version" is included in the output).

4. Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the output of the subprocess call is read and strip only the version number without any additional text.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function reads the output from the subprocess call as a string, splits it using the separator ", " and retains the version number only. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
