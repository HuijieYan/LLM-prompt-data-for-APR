1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is designed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not correctly parsing the version output from the shell command, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual version strings.

2. The potential error location is within the `info` function, specifically in the way it reads and processes the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the `proc.stdout.read()` call does not account for the `.decode('utf-8')` method before stripping the version string. This leads to the unexpected output format that includes the text 'fish, version'. This discrepancy causes the test to fail as it expects only the version number.

4. To fix the bug, the `info` function should correctly decode the byte output of the process and trim any unnecessary text to only retain the version number.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version will correctly extract only the version number from the shell output, ensuring that the function returns the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' string.
