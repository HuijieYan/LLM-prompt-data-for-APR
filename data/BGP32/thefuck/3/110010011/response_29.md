### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info()` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected output of the function compared to the actual output.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the use of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info()` function in Fish shell. This is caused by incorrect parsing and formatting of the Fish shell version.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract the Fish shell version from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and format it as `Fish Shell X.Y.Z`.
5. The corrected version should properly decode the output and format the version string.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The bug fix involves adding `split(',')[1].strip()` to extract only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This code will properly parse the version number and format it correctly as `Fish Shell X.Y.Z`.
