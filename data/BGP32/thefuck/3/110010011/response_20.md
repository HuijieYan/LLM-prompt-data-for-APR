## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the problem lies in the way the version information is being extracted and formatted. The error message indicates that the function is returning the version string with more context than necessary, leading to a failing assertion in the test case.

The referenced GitHub issue provides additional context, indicating that the `thefuck -v` command causes a hang in the Fish Shell initialization due to the recursive loop triggered by `Fish.info()`.

## Error Location
The bug is most likely caused by how the version string is extracted and formatted in the `info` function. Specifically, the formatting of the output string using `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` may not correctly handle the version string returned by the command.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the version string read from the command output. The version string includes more content than just the version number, leading to a mismatch in the assertion when comparing the expected version with the actual returned value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the version string extracted from the command output needs to be processed to only include the version number without any additional text. One way to achieve this is by splitting the version information string based on a delimiter (such as comma or space) containing the version number.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Split the version string by comma and extract the version number
        version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By splitting the version string returned by the command and extracting just the version number, the corrected function should now properly format the output string with the correct version information. This updated version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
