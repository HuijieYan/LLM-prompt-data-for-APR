### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class**: The `info` function within the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. **Error Location**: The error seems to be related to reading the version from the subprocess output and constructing the return value.
3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug is caused by incorrectly constructing the return value with the full output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command instead of just the version number.
4. **Strategy for Fixing**: Modify the code to extract only the version number from the output and include it in the return value without any additional strings.

### Buggy Code Fix:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output
        version_number = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By modifying the `info` function to correctly extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess command, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
