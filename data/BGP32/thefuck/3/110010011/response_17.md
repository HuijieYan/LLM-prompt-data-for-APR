### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current Fish shell.
2. The error occurs when attempting to compare the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' with the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
3. The error message indicates that the version extracted from the `Popen` execution is incorrect.
4. The bug is caused by the unexpected output format of the `fish` command, resulting in an incorrect version string.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract and format the version information from the `Popen` command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the code to correctly extract and format the version string from the output of the `fish` command.
- Update the `info` function to handle the extraction and formatting of the version information correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we directly run the `fish -v` command to get the version information and then correctly extract the version part from the output using the `split(',')` method. This approach ensures that we extract the version information accurately for formatting in the desired format.
