### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the Fish shell version using the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, but the output is parsed incorrectly causing the mismatch in version comparisons.
2. The error is due to incorrect parsing of the version information from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
3. The error message indicates that the output is not properly parsed, leading to the assertion failure. The expected version does not match the actual version returned from the shell command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly process the output of the `Popen` command to extract the version information accurately.
5. We need to modify the parsing of the version information to remove any extra characters and ensure that we compare the version correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract version number correctly
        if ',' in version:
            version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract the Fish shell version and remove any extra characters before comparing with the expected version. This should resolve the assertion failure and fix the bug.
