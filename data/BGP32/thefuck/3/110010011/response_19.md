### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the output is not being correctly processed.
2. The failing test is trying to check if the correct version string is returned by the `info` function.
3. The error message shows that the actual output includes the "fish, version" string, which is incorrect.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `stdout.read()` method does not provide the entire output at once, hence the version string is incomplete.
5. We need to modify the way we capture and process the output from the `Popen` process in order to get the correct version string.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to capture the full output from the `Popen` process and then extract the version string correctly. We can use the `communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and capture the complete output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate()` method to capture the complete output from the `Popen` process and then extracting the version string correctly, the corrected version of the `info` function should now return the expected version string.
