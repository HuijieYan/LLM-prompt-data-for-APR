### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` is trying to get the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function.
2. The error message indicates that the returned version has an unexpected format leading to the assertion failure.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy implementation in `Fish.info()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct Fish shell version is extracted from the command output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` includes additional text alongside the version number (`fish, version <version>`), causing the version string to be incorrectly formatted.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version number is extracted from the command output. We can split the output on commas and spaces to extract the version number correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split()[2]  # Split the output on spaces and extract the version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract the Fish shell version from the command output, resolving the bug.
