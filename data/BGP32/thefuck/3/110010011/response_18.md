### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package.
2. The error message indicates that the actual output of the `info` function is slightly different from the expected output.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect formatting of the version string returned by the `info` function. The error message shows the version returned by the command as `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the expected format is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the formatting of the version string to match the expected output.
5. We need to modify the formatting of the version string to ensure it matches the expected format.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The correct implementation of the info function in Fish class
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]  # Extract version number from 'fish, version 3.5.9'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the way we extract the version number from the command output, we can ensure that the version string is formatted correctly before returning it in the `info` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
