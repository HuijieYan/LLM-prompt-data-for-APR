### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the way it reads the output of the subprocess is causing the bug.
2. The bug is causing the assertion error in the test case, as the expected shell info format is not being achieved.
3. The bug is related to how the version information is read from the stdout of the `Popen` subprocess call. It seems that the version string 'fish, version 3.5.9' is not being processed correctly, resulting in the incorrect format in the return value of the `info` function.
4. To fix the bug, the version string retrieved from stdout needs to be processed correctly to extract just the version number for the return value.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The version string obtained from the subprocess call needs to be decoded properly and stripped to extract only the version number.
2. Using regular expressions might be a good approach to isolate the version number from the stdout output.
3. The corrected version should ensure that the output format matches the expected return value in the test case.
4. Handle the potential errors that might occur during the subprocess call to improve the robustness of the function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
            match = re.search(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', version_output)
            if match:
                version = match.group(1)
            else:
                version = 'Unknown'
        except Exception:
            version = 'Unknown'
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By incorporating the suggested changes as shown in the corrected version above, the bug in the original `info` function should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
