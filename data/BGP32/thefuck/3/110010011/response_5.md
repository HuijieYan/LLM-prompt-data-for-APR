### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', leading to an assertion error in the test case.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of the version string when constructing the return value in the `info` function. It is missing the correct parsing of the version string from the command output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to parse the version string correctly and format it properly before returning it in the `info` function.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        if ',' in version:  # Check for the presence of comma in the version
            version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version after comma
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version of the function should properly parse the version string to extract only the version number without the unnecessary text. This will ensure that the function returns the correct version string as expected by the test case.
