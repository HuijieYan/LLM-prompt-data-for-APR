### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to extract the version of the Fish shell by running a command. The function then formats this version number into a string.
2. The error occurs during the comparison of the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) and the actual output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
3. The error message in the failing test indicates that the actual output includes additional unnecessary characters.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to the extra characters included in the actual output, which results from not properly extracting only the version number from the command output.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the function to correctly extract only the version number, ensuring that it matches the expected output.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Import necessary module from subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

# Update the buggy function to fix the bug
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1] # Get the last element (version number) after splitting by whitespace
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the command and extracting the version number correctly, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
