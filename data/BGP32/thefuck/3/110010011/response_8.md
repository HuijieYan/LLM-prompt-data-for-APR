### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using `Popen` and reading the output. However, there is an issue with how the version is being processed and returned.
   
2. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the version string extracted is not in the correct format.

3. The GitHub issue suggests that there is a recursive loop triggered by the use of `thefuck -v` in conjunction with the Fish shell. This could potentially be related to how the version information is being retrieved and processed in the code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the extracted version string is correctly processed and formatted before being returned by the `info` function. We should modify the way the `version` is extracted and formatted to match the expected output format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_parts = version.split(", ")
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_parts[1])
```

In the corrected version, we split the version string at `", "` to extract the actual version number only, which should match the expected output format. This fix addresses the issue by correctly formatting the version information extracted from the shell command output. This corrected version should resolve the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the plugin.
