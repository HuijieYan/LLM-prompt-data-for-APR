### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to fetch the version of the Fish shell. It uses `Popen` to execute a command and read the output.
2. The error message indicates that the output being read is not processed correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected version string and the actual version string.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the usage of `thefuck -v` in Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy behavior of `info()` function in `shells/fish.py`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the output of the `Popen` command to capture the version string accurately.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the output of `Popen` command correctly in the `info()` function. When the output is read using `proc.stdout.read()`, it includes additional information like `fish, version` which needs to be stripped out before formatting the version string.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `info()` function to correctly extract the version string from the output.
2. Strip out unnecessary information like `fish, version` to accurately capture the version.
3. Update the return statement to format the extracted version string correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
        version_str = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_str)
```

The updated version of the `info()` function reads the output, strips unnecessary characters like `fish, version`, and extracts the version string accurately to format it correctly. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected version string.
