1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using an external process via `Popen` and `PIPE`.
- The error message indicates that the expected output of the function is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, causing the assertion error.
- The GitHub issue confirms that there is a problem with the version retrieval causing a hang in certain scenarios.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The issue might be related to how the version is extracted from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
- There could be extra characters or formatting included in the version string that is causing the discrepancy.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command containing additional text like `'fish, version'` before the actual version number.
- This mismatch in the expected output and the retrieved output causes the assertion error.

4. Fix strategy:
- Modify the way the version is extracted from the stdout of the process to eliminate any additional text and only keep the version number for comparison.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output string by commas, take the second part, and then split it by spaces to extract the version number without any additional text. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
