## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue

### Buggy Function
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish Shell in this case. The function executes a subprocess using `Popen` to get the Fish version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

### Corresponding Error Message
The error message indicates that the actual output of the `info` function does not match the expected output. The actual output includes the version from the command with additional text, causing the assertion to fail.

### GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue describes a scenario where Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin triggers a recursive loop related to the `info` function in the `Fish` class, leading to initialization issues with the Fish Shell.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The output of `proc.stdout.read()` in the `info` function is expected to contain the version with additional text, causing the assertion failure.
2. The formatting of the version string might be incorrect, resulting in differences between the actual and expected outputs.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information

The bug is caused by the `info` function in the `Fish` class not correctly handling the version output from the subprocess. The version is being read with extra text, causing a mismatch with the expected output. This issue, along with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, triggers a recursive loop due to problems with Fish Shell initialization.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function in the `Fish` class correctly processes the version output from the subprocess. This may involve using proper parsing techniques to extract the version string only and adjusting the formatting to match the expected output.

## Corrected Version of the `Fish` class

```python
# The corrected version of the `Fish` class fixing the bug
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version from the output
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The version extracted from the command output is properly processed to remove unwanted text.
- The extracted version is formatted in a way that matches the expected output ('Fish Shell x.x.x').

This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure that the `info` function produces the expected output without additional text.
