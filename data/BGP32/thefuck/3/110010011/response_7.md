## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info(self)` within the `Fish` class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The error message is indicating that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of the version string retrieved from the command output.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the way the version string is extracted and formatted.
5. The correction will involve adjusting the parsing of the version string to extract only the version number.

## Correction
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[-1].split()[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string based on the comma and space, we can extract only the version number part. This corrected version should now return the expected result and pass the failing test.
