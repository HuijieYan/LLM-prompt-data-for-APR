### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `info(self)` within the `Fish` class in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file.
- The function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command, but it is not parsing the output correctly.
- The error message shows that the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, causing the assertion error.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the plugin is triggering a recursive loop due to this incorrect output.

### Error Location:
- The error occurs when trying to decode the output of the process to get the version.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The incorrect output is due to not parsing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command correctly, leading to 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the code to properly parse the output of the command to extract only the version number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # Corrected the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output of the command by `,` and taking the last part, we can extract just the version number. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
