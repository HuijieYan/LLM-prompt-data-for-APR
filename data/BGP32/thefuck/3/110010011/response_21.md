## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to extract the version of Fish shell using a subprocess.
2. The error message indicates that the extracted version format is incorrect, resulting in a failed assertion.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the version output.
4. One strategy to fix the bug is to properly format the version output before returning it.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this fixed version:
- The version number extracted from the subprocess output is properly formatted using `split()` to extract only the version number.
- This should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected format for the version number.
