1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` within the `thefuck` package is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through the `Popen` function. The retrieved version is then formatted as `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function include the handling of the output from the `Popen` subprocess call and the decoding of the byte stream.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` call is returning the output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` as a byte stream, which includes unnecessary characters such as 'fish,' before the version number. This incorrect output results in the assertion failure during testing.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly extract the version number from the output of the `Popen` subprocess call, eliminate the unnecessary characters, and format the version string as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected by the test case.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[1].strip() # Extract the version number
    return 'Fish Shell ' + version
```

With this correction, the function properly extracts the version number from the output, removes any unnecessary characters, and formats the version string accurately. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
