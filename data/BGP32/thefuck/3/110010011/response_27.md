## Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling the output of the command, resulting in an incorrect version string being returned. The failing test is trying to verify that the correct version string is returned, but it fails due to the incorrect handling of the output.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. Reading the output of the `Popen` process.
2. Formatting the version string.

## Explaining the Bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output of the command run by the `Popen` process in the `info` function. The function reads the output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, but this does not correctly capture the version string from the command output. As a result, the version string returned is not in the expected format, leading to the failing test.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version string is parsed correctly from the output of the command run by `Popen`. We should read the output line by line and extract the version string from it. Additionally, we should format the version string properly before returning it.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number from the output line
    version = version.split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By reading the output of the `Popen` process line by line and extracting the version number correctly, the corrected version of the `info` function should now return the expected version string.
