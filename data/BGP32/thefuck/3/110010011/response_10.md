### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file.
2. The error message is asserting the incorrect output of the `shell.info()` method.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version output from the `fish` shell command, resulting in the version including unnecessary characters ("fish," and "\n").
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the parsing of the version output to only extract the version number.
5. We will modify the code to properly extract and format the version number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting just the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version should properly extract the version number from the output of the `fish` shell command and format it correctly. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and make the test pass successfully.
