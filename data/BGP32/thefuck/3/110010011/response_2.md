### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell but is not formatting it correctly.
2. The error message shows that the output of the function is not as expected due to the incorrect formatting of the version.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop, which is related to the incorrect behavior of the `Fish.info()` function.
4. The bug is caused by not properly stripping the output of the command and formatting it as the version string.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly read and format the version output.

### Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `info` function to correctly format the version output to only store the version number without any additional text.
2. Use `communicate()` method instead of reading `stdout` directly to avoid potential issues.
3. Strip the version string to remove any leading or trailing white spaces.
4. Update the function with the corrected version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the info function in the Fish class
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making these changes, the function will now correctly extract and format the version number from the command output, resolving the bug.
