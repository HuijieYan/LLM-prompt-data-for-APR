### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the Fish shell version by executing a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the test code, the expected output of the command is different (`'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`), leading to a failing test assertion.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is expecting only the version number in the output of the command (`3.5.9`), but the actual output includes extra text (`'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`). This mismatch causes the assertion to fail, resulting in the error observed in the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract and return only the version number from the command output. This can be achieved by parsing the output returned by `proc.stdout.read()` to extract the version number.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(", version ")[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly extract the version number from the command output and return it as expected. It should pass the failing test case successfully.
