### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using the `Popen` function.
2. The expected shell version is `3.5.9`.
3. The failing test sets the return value of `stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function incorrectly formats the output in the `return` statement, leading to an assertion error.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the shell version extracted from the output.
5. The bug can be fixed by correctly extracting the version from the output and formatting it in the expected way.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the way the version is extracted from the output and form the correct output string.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(", version ")[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the version number from the output and format the string as expected.
