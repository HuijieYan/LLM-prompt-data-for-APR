## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell being used.
2. The function uses `Popen` to execute a command to get the Fish shell version.
3. The failing test sets up the mock behavior for `Popen` to return the output of the command.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the output from the command to extract the version.
5. The expected output of the function should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The function needs to correctly extract the version from the output of the command provided by `Popen`.
2. We should modify the way the version string is extracted from the command output.

## Bug-fixed code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version from the output
        version = version_output.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the `version_output` string correctly, we can extract the version number and format it into the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
