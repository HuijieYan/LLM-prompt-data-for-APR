## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the subprocess `Popen` to execute a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and fetch the output to get the version of the Fish shell. However, there are a few issues:
   - The command being executed should be `fish --version` to get the correct version string.
   - The `Popen` call is not correctly matching the expected reading of the version from the subprocess output.

2. The failing test is trying to mock the return value of `Popen` to simulate the output of the command `fish --version` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n`. It then checks if the method `info` returns `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

3. The failing test provides the actual and expected output values, showing that the actual output includes extra text `fish,` which is unexpected.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the subprocess command being executed to `fish --version`, and correctly process the output from the subprocess to extract the version string without additional text.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By fixing the subprocess command to `fish --version` and updating the way the version string is extracted from the output of the subprocess, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case with the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
