### Correction

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the command used to get the version of Fish shell. The correct command should be `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` used in the original code. 

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

This correction changes the command to request the version of the Fish shell using `'fish', '--version'`, which is consistent with the test expectation. It then extracts and formats the version information accordingly.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
