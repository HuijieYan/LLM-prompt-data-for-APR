### Solution:

#### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and extracting the output. However, the command being executed is `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` which may not provide the correct version output as expected in the failing test. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test.

#### Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function. The command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not return the version information in the correct format.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the command inside the `Popen` call to be `'fish --version'` which will correctly return the version of the Fish shell. This change will ensure that the version extracted is in the expected format.

#### The Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command passed to `Popen` to `'fish --version'`, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell as expected in the failing test.
