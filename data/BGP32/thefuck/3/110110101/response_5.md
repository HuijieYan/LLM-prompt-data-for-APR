### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the expected version extracted from the command output is `'3.5.9'`, which is different from the actual output `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the fact that the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not output just the version number directly. Instead, it outputs the text `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, which includes unnecessary additional text.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the command output. One approach could be to split the output at the comma and extract the version part. Another approach could involve adjusting the command being executed to only output the version number directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(", ")[1].split()[1]  # Extracting the version number only
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version should successfully extract the version number from the command output and provide the expected `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` result.
