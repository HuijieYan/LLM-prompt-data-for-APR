### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the command used to get the version is incorrect ('echo $FISH_VERSION' should be changed to '--version').
2. The test is mocking the `stdout.read` method to return the correct version but the function itself is not using the correct command to fetch the version.
3. The error message indicates that the expected output is missing the correct version and has extra text.
4. To fix the bug, the command used to get the version of the Fish shell should be changed to 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By changing the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, the corrected version of the function now fetches the correct version of the Fish shell and should pass the failing test.
