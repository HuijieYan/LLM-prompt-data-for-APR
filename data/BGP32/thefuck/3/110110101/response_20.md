### Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) is different from the one that the test expects (`fish --version`).
- The `test_info()` test function is mocking the output of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read()` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, expecting the shell version to be extracted from this output.
- The error message shows that the actual output of the function is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command executed to retrieve the shell version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) in the `info` function and the command expected by the test (`fish --version`). This leads to the incorrect shell version being extracted, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed by `Popen` in the `info` function to match the one expected by the test. We should change the command to `['fish', '--version']` so that the correct version is extracted.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version part
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the `info` function now executes the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, resolving the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
