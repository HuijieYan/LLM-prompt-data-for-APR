### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test is setting the return value of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is different from what the function expects.
2. The error message shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output includes the full string `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch in the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

### Bug Fix
1. The function should extract the version number from the correct output format.
2. Change the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `fish -c 'echo $version'` to match the test case's expected input.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
