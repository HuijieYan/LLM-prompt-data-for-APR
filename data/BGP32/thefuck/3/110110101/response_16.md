## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation:
1. The command being executed is incorrect (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `fish --version`).
2. The `Popen` call is not properly handling the command execution and reading the output.

## Bug Cause
The main cause of the bug is that the `info()` function is executing the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This results in an incorrect version string being returned, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the command being executed to `['fish', '--version']` so that it retrieves the version of Fish shell correctly.
2. Properly handle the command execution using `Popen` to fetch the correct output.

## Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The command `['fish', '--version']` is used to get the correct version.
- Instead of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, we use `proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()` to correctly read the output.
- The return statement formats the output with the correct version string.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
