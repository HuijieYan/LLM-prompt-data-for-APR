### Analysis:
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a process to retrieve the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which may not always return the shell version as expected.
2. The expected output in the failing test is `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which does not match the format of the command being executed in the function.

### Error Location:
The main error lies in the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected output in the test.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the mismatch between the command being executed and the expected output in the failing test. Additionally, the command should be modified to fetch the correct version information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command executed in the `info` function to fetch the correct version information.
2. Update the test case to match the new command and expected output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated function to fix the bug
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Updated test to match the corrected version
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With the corrected version above, the `info` function now correctly fetches the version information using the `--version` flag, and the test case is updated to reflect this change.
