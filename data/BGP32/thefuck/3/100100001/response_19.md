The potential error location in the buggy function is where it tries to read the version of the Fish shell using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. However, in the failing test, the expected output is 'fish, version 3.5.9\n'.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the info function does not match the expected output of the failing test. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command in the Popen call within the info function to 'fish --version' to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the info function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the info function should now correctly extract the version of the Fish shell using 'fish --version', and the failing test should pass with the updated command.
