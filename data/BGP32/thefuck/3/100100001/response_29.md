1. The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through `Popen`. The version number is expected to be extracted from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test case provided is expecting the version number to be fetched by executing `fish --version` instead. This discrepancy between the expected output command and the actual execution command is causing the bug.

2. The potential error location is identified in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the correct command should be `fish --version`.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect command being used to fetch the Fish shell version. The test is mocking the output of `fish --version`, while the buggy function is trying to extract information using a different command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`). This mismatch results in the function returning an incorrect version number that fails the test.

4. To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected output based on the test case.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
``` 

This corrected version of the `info` function should now properly extract the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command and pass the provided test case.
