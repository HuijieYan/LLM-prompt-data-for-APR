The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test function `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file expects the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function to match the expectation of the test function.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` in the `info` function, the correct version of the Fish shell will be retrieved. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
