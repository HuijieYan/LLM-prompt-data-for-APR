The issue in the buggy function lies in the command used to determine the Fish shell version. The command being executed is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the version to be fetched using the 'fish --version' command.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to match the expected command output in the test.
2. Update the decoding and stripping of the output to correctly capture and return the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making these changes, the fixed function should now correctly return the Fish shell version as expected by the test case provided.
