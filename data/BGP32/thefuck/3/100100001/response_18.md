The issue in the buggy function lies in the Popen call where the command passed is retrieving the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable value instead of retrieving the version directly from the `fish` command.

Here's an explanation of the bug:
- The original command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is trying to echo the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, which is not the same as the actual version of the `fish` shell.

To fix the bug:
- Modify the Popen call to directly query the `fish --version` command to get the shell version instead of relying on an environment variable that may not be set correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In this corrected version:
- The Popen call now uses `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version directly from the `fish` shell command.
- The obtained version is then extracted using `version.split()[-1]` to fix any potential formatting issues.
