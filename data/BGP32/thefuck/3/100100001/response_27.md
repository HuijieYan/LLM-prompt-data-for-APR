The bug in the provided `info` function lies in the command used to get the Fish shell version. The function is trying to extract the version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test expects the version to be obtained using the `--version` flag.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command that retrieves the Fish shell version to include the `--version` flag.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will correctly capture the Fish shell version, ensuring that it aligns with the expectations of the failing test.

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test successfully.
