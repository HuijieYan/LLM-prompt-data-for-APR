The issue in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the fish version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not the correct way to retrieve the fish version. Instead, `fish --version` should be used to get the correct version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])  # Extracting just the version number

```

Explanation:
- The original function used `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is incorrect for retrieving the version of Fish shell. Replaced it with `fish --version` command.
- Used `split()` to extract only the version number from the output of the command.
- Updated the return statement to format the version properly.

By making these changes, the corrected function should be able to correctly retrieve and format the Fish shell version, thus passing the failing test.
