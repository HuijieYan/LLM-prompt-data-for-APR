### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the test provided is mocking the result of the `Popen` subprocess call to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. This mismatch in the expected output and the actual command being run is causing the test to fail.

### Error Location:
The error in the buggy function lies in the command being run in the subprocess. It should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected output in the test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by the mismatch between the command being run in the subprocess and the expected output in the test. The function is currently trying to get the version using `$FISH_VERSION`, which is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `Popen` command to run `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected output in the test.
- Decode the output correctly to extract the version number.
- Update the `assert` statement in the test to match the corrected command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will run `['fish', '--version']` in the subprocess to extract the version correctly. The test should now pass with this updated function.
