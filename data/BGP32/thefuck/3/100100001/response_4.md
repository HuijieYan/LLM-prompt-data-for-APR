The buggy function `info` is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, in the failing test, it expects the command `fish --version` to be used instead. This mismatch causes the function to return an incorrect version and fail the test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the fixed function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `fish --version` command, and the failing test should pass successfully.
