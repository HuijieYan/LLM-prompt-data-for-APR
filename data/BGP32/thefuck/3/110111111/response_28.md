The issue with the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' does not return the version number in the expected format. Additionally, the test is asserting against the wrong value, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to retrieve the Fish shell version correctly. We should also modify the assertion in the failing test to match the expected output format.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function will correctly obtain the Fish shell version and format it for the expected output. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test as well.

Now the test should pass without any assertion errors.
