### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the expected version is extracted from the output of `fish --version` which is different from the command used in the function. This discrepancy leads to the assertion error since the expected version format does not match what is obtained in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to update the `info()` function in the `Fish` class to use `fish --version` command to retrieve the version information, aligning it with the expectations of the test case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the function will now correctly obtain the version information in the expected format, addressing the issue raised in the failing test. This corrected version of the function should now pass the test case.
