To fix the bug in the `info` function inside the `Fish` class, we need to correct the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and then format the output correctly. The issue is caused by using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The only change needed is to update the command to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. Additionally, we modify the way we extract the Fish shell version to only include the version number without any additional text.

By making this change, the function will correctly extract the version number and format the output to match the expected value.

This modified function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values while addressing the GitHub issue related to the incorrect output when using `thefuck -v` with Fish shell.
