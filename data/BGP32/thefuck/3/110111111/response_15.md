The bug in the provided function `info` is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to an unexpected version string being returned. 

### Error Location:
The incorrect command used in the `Popen` call to get the Fish shell version is identified as a potential error location.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the failing test `test_info`, the expected version string is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` due to the command used in the `Popen` call. This results in the assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` needs to be updated to retrieve only the version number without any additional strings.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected version should now properly extract and return the Fish shell version without any additional text, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
