Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is related to incorrect parsing of the `FISH_VERSION` output. The failing test expects only the version number to be returned, without the extra text "fish, version", but the function is including this extra text in the return value, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should parse the `FISH_VERSION` output correctly and only extract the version number without any additional text.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract version number without extra text
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By removing the extra text "fish, version " from the version variable, the function now correctly extracts only the version number. This correction should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
