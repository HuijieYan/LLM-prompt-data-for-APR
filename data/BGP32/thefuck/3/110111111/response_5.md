## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` should be replaced with `fish --version` to accurately fetch the version string from the shell output.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly extract the Fish shell version from the output of `fish --version`, resolving the issue highlighted in the failing test. The function now reads the version correctly and formats it as `'Fish Shell X.X.X'`.
