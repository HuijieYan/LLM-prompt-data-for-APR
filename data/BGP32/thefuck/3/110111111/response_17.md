## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of Fish Shell by running a command using `Popen`, but it is not fetching the correct output based on the test case.
2. The test case is expecting the version number to be extracted correctly from the output of the command.
3. The test case is failing due to the incorrect comparison of the actual output with the expected output.
4. The bug is causing the function to return the version information in a different format than expected.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug lies in how the function `info` handles the output of the command run using `Popen`. The expected version number is not being correctly extracted and compared with the expected value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `info` correctly extracts the version number from the output of the command and formats it as expected. We can modify the way the output is read and stripped to extract only the version number.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the version string to extract only the version number and then format it as expected before returning. This modification should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
