### Analysis
1. The provided buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) might not return the version in a format that is directly usable for creating the desired output.
2. The failing test is setting up a mock scenario where `Popen` returns a version string similar to `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. This string is not directly usable in the current implementation of the `info` function to extract just the version number.
3. The failing assertion error is due to the mismatch between the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version number is extracted from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
5. We need to update the `info` function to parse the version number correctly and format it with the expected string before returning.

### Correction
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string based on ',' and then extracting the version number from the resulting list, we are able to extract just the version number and format it correctly with the expected string. This corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
