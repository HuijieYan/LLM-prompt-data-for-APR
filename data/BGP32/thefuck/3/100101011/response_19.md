### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the expected version output is different from what the function is trying to read.
- The failing test sets the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, which means the function should expect `'fish, version 3.5.9'` as the output, but it currently expects only the version number.
- The issue on GitHub indicates that the function is causing a recursive loop due to incorrect handling of version output.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the mismatch in the expected output format (including "fish, version") and the actual processing of the output in the `info` function. This results in a failure to extract and present the correct version information.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `info` function to process the version output correctly by considering the full format including "fish, version".

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", ")[1].strip()  # Extract the version part
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

After implementing this correction, the function should correctly extract and display the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, resolving the bug.
