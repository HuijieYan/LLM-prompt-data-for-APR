### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not be capturing the correct version information.
2. Incorrect handling of the output from the `Popen` process.
3. The comparison in the test function might be expecting the wrong output format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is trying to get the Fish Shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should be running `fish --version` instead. Additionally, the test is setting the side effect for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` with a different output format (`b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`) than what the function is handling, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly capture the Fish Shell version.
2. Adjust the side effect in the test to match the output format that the function expects (`b'3.5.9\n'`).
3. Update the comparison in the test function to reflect the corrected output format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test Function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By correcting the command and output handling, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version and pass the test case provided.
