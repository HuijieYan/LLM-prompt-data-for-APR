### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command used in the Popen call may not match the expected command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. The decoding method used on the output may not be handling the output format correctly.
3. The way the version is extracted from the output may be incorrect.
4. The assertion in the test function might be expecting a different command to be executed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from a mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function and the expected command in the test function. The test function expects the command `fish --version`, but the `info` function uses `echo $FISH_VERSION`, resulting in a failure in the test assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to match the expected command in the test function.
2. Adjust the decoding and version extraction methods if needed to ensure the correct version is obtained.
3. Modify the test assertion to align with the updated command used in the `info` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making these changes, the `info` function should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
