### Error Location:
The cause of the bug is in the `info` method of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The method is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be executed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the method is using the incorrect command to obtain the Fish shell version. The method is not using the command expected by the test, leading to a mismatch in the output and causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command executed in the `info` method to match the command expected by the test. By changing the command to `fish --version`, we can ensure that the output aligns with the test expectations and resolves the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` with `--version` in the Popen command, the correct Fish shell version will be retrieved, matching the expected output in the failing test.
