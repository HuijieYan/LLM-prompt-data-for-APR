### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is attempting to get the version of Fish Shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` method.
2. The test function sets the expected output to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and checks if the command `['fish', '--version']` is called.
3. The failure occurs because the command being executed is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`.
4. The GitHub issue states that using the `-v` flag with `thefuck` plugin triggers a loop, which relates to the incorrect command execution in the `info` function.

### Bug Cause:
The `Popen` method is called with the incorrect arguments, resulting in the wrong command being executed. This leads to the function returning the incorrect version of the Fish Shell.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the command being executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version, the function will now execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version, resolving the bug and ensuring the function returns the expected output.
