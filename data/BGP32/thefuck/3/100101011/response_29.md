### Potential Error Locations:
1. the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` in the Popen call
2. incorrect expectation value in the failing test for Popen.call_args

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` used in the Popen call, which is different from the expected command `fish --version` in the failing test. Additionally, the failing test expects the `Popen.call_args[0][0]` to be `['fish', '--version']`, which is not consistent with the actual Popen call in the buggy function.

The GitHub issue indicates that using `-v` with the thefuck plugin triggers a recursive loop due to this inconsistency in the command being executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the Popen call in the `info` function to use the correct command `fish --version`.
2. Update the failing test `test_info` to correctly assert the expected command in Popen.call_args[0][0].

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test Function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

After making these changes, the function should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
