### Analyzing the Bug

1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up a `Popen` mock object to return a specific version output when `shell.info()` is called.
3. The failing test expects the output of `shell.info()` to be formatted as `'Fish Shell {version}'` and for the `Popen` call to be `['fish', '--version']`.
4. The expected version output is `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is currently not extracting the correct version due to the command being `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

### Error Identification
The cause of the bug lies in the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which does not retrieve the version in the expected format.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the `info` function to not extract the correct version due to the incorrect shell command used to retrieve the version.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the shell command needs to be changed to retrieve the version in a format that matches the expected version output of the failing test.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test
The updated test remains the same as it verifies the formatted version output and the correct `Popen` call:

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.readline.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By changing the shell command in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']`, the corrected version will now extract the correct version information and pass the failing test.
