### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. 
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock behavior for `Popen` and expects the version string to be retrieved from the output of the command executed in the function.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect command being executed in the `Popen` call, leading to the incorrect version retrieval.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being used in the `Popen` call, instead of `fish --version`. This results in the function fetching the wrong information and failing the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to correctly fetch the Fish shell version by executing `fish --version`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']` in the `Popen` call, the function should now correctly retrieve and return the Fish shell version, passing the failing test case.
