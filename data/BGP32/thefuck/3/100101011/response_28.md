### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the current implementation is incorrect.
2. The call to Popen should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. Additionally, the `strip()` method should be used after decoding the output to remove any unwanted whitespace characters.
3. The test is failing because the expected version string is not matching with the actual version string obtained in the function. The incorrect command is being used to retrieve the version. The provided test expects `['fish', '--version']` while the function uses `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
4. To fix this bug, the command passed to Popen should be corrected to `'fish', '--version'` to obtain the correct version of the Fish shell.
5. Updated/corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[-1].strip())
```

This corrected version should address the bug and align the behavior of retrieving the Fish shell version with the provided test.
