### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in `shells/fish.py` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the failing test, it is checking for the version using `['fish', '--version']`, which leads to an incorrect assertion failure due to different commands being used.

The provided input/output values indicate that the function is reading the version output directly from stdout and not executing the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version. This mismatch causes the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from using the incorrect command to obtain the version of the Fish shell in the `info()` function. The function is expecting a specific command output while the test case sets a different command output, leading to a failing assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info()` function to match the command being checked in the test case. This will ensure consistency and correct output validation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info()` function in the `shells/fish.py` file will now use the correct command to fetch the version of the Fish shell, resolving the bug and ensuring compatibility with the provided test case.
