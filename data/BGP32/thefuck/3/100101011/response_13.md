## Potential Error Locations
1. The command passed to `Popen` may not be retrieving the version string correctly.
2. Incorrect reading or decoding of the output from the process.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect command being passed to `Popen` to retrieve the Fish shell version. In the provided buggy function, the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is used, but the test expects the version to be obtained using `['fish', '--version']`. This mismatch causes the version string to be incorrectly read or decoded, leading to the test failure.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the test expectations. Additionally, ensure that the output from the process is correctly read and decoded to obtain the version string.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

By correcting the command to retrieve the Fish shell version and adjusting the way the version string is parsed from the output, the function should now return the correct version information, fixing the bug identified in the failing test.
