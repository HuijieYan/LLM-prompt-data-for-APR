### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish shell.
2. The function is using `Popen` to execute a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version. However, in the failing test, the expected version information is different from what is being retrieved.
3. The failing test sets up the `Popen` return value to simulate the command output, but the function is reading the output incorrectly, leading to the wrong version being returned.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a problem related to running `thefuck -v` which may be due to incorrect version retrieval.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from how the function reads and processes the output of the `Popen` command. The function is not handling the expected output format correctly, resulting in the incorrect version information being returned.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the way the function reads and decodes the `Popen` output to match the expected version format.
2. Update the command used by `Popen` if necessary to ensure the correct version information retrieval.
3. Adjust the `info` function to handle the version information appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    # Extract version number from the command output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version modifies the command executed by `Popen` to retrieve the Fish shell version correctly. It then parses the output to extract the version number accurately, ensuring that the function returns the expected version information.
