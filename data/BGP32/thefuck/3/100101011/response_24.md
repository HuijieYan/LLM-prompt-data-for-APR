### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to determine the Fish Shell version by running a command. However, the command being run (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) does not return the correct version information. This leads to incorrect output and failing the test.

### Error Location
The main error lies in the command being executed to fetch the Fish Shell version.

### Cause of the Bug
The function is running `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the correct command to get the Fish Shell version is `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the command being executed causes the function to fetch incorrect version information, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the command that is executed to get the Fish Shell version to `fish --version`.
- Update the test to reflect the correct command being run and the expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version above, the `info` function will execute the correct command to extract the Fish Shell version, and the test should now pass successfully.
