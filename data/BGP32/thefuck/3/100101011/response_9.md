### Analysis:
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to extract the version information from the Fish shell and format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'. However, the current implementation is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which may not always return the expected version number. Additionally, in the failing test, the expected command is `fish --version`, which is not consistent with the actual command being executed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Command used to fetch Fish shell version: `echo $FISH_VERSION`
2. Discrepancy in the expected and actual commands in the test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used to fetch the Fish version in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command in the test function (`fish --version`). This discrepancy results in the function returning an unexpected or incorrect version number, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `info` function to correctly fetch the Fish shell version by using `fish --version`.
2. Modify the test's expectation to align with the corrected command for fetching the version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The changes made include updating the command to fetch the version to `fish --version` and then extracting the version number from the output accordingly.

Updating the test function to reflect these changes:
```python
# Update the test in the file: tests/shells/test_fish.py

def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

By making these modifications, the `info` function should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
