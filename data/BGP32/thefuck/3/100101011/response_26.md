### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command `fish` with the argument `-c` to execute a command that outputs the version.
2. The function then reads the output of the process and formats it as 'Fish Shell {version}'.
3. The failing test mocks the `Popen` class and sets the expected output to 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', but the function fails to parse this correctly.
4. The current implementation is not correctly reading and parsing the output from the `Popen` process.

### Bug:
The bug is in how the function expects and processes the output of the `Popen` process. It fails to correctly interpret the output obtained, leading to a mismatch in expected and actual versions.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly read and parse the output from the `Popen` process. We need to ensure that the version extracted is in the correct format to match the expected output of the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract the version information from the output of the `Popen` process by splitting the string at ', version ' and taking the version part. This should resolve the issue and make the function parse the version correctly based on the failing test.
