### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test case is mocking the command `fish -version` instead.
2. The test case expects the version string to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, which is different from the actual output format `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the plugin triggers a recursive loop due to incorrect handling in the `info` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by:
- Incorrect command used in the function (`echo $FISH_VERSION` vs. `fish -version`)
- Difference in the expected output format in the test case
- Recursive loop triggered by the plugin due to incorrect handling in the `info` function

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the command in the `info` function to match the test case's expectation `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Adjust the expectation in the test case to `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
3. Implement a fix to prevent the recursive loop in the plugin by optimizing the `info` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', 'Fish Shell').strip()
    return version
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the version information from the Fish shell. Additionally, the test case should be updated to reflect the adjusted output format and prevent the recursive loop issue stated in the GitHub reference.
