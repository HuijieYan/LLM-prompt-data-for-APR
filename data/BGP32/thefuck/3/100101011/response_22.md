### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package retrieves the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up the `Popen` mock to return the version information, but the expected command `['fish', '--version']` does not align with the actual command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. The failing test indicates that the `info` function is expected to return the version as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current implementation does not capture the correct version.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the way the version is being retrieved can lead to recursive loops, indicating a potential issue in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation of the `info` function in `fish.py` retrieves the version information of Fish shell using a command that does not match the expected command. This mismatch results in incorrect version retrieval, failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the subprocess call in the `info` function to use the correct command to retrieve the version of Fish shell.
2. Adjust the version parsing to properly extract the version information.
3. Ensure that the corrected version aligns with the expectations of the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2].strip(',')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version ensures that the correct command is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and extracts the version information accurately. This version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
