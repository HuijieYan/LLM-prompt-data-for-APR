### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is attempting to get the version of Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test is setting the expected output to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is not matching due to an issue in the way the version is extracted.
3. The `Popen` call uses `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` but the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`. This discrepancy in the command being executed is causing the version extraction to fail.
4. The `Popen` return value is mocked with the wrong output, and the `read` method is not being utilized properly to handle the byte output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mismatch in the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION` vs `--version`) and the incorrect handling of the byte output in the test setup.
The incorrect handling of the return value of `proc.stdout.read()` method leads to the failure in extracting the version.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the command being executed should be corrected to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected command in the test. Additionally, proper decoding and stripping of the byte output from `proc.stdout.read()` should be done to extract the version accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function uses the correct command (`['fish', '--version']`) to get the version of Fish shell. Additionally, it properly decodes and strips the output to extract the version value.
