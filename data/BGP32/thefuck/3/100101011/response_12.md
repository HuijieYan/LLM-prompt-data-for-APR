### Potential Error Locations
- The command used in Popen might not be fetching the correct version of Fish shell.
- Reading the output using `proc.stdout.read()` might not provide the expected output.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used in Popen to fetch the version of Fish shell. Additionally, the way the output is read from `proc.stdout.read()` is not yielding the expected result. This leads to the function returning an incorrect version.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be changed to fetch the version using `'fish', '--version'`. Furthermore, reading the output should be handled properly to extract the version information accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version:
- The command passed to Popen is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the version information.
- The output reading process is modified to correctly extract the version information. It reads a line from the output, decodes it, strips whitespace, and then retrieves the last element (version) after splitting the string.

This corrected version should now accurately fetch the version of Fish shell and return the correct shell name along with the version.
