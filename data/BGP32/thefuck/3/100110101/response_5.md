### Correction:

The bug in the provided function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not accurately fetch the version as expected from the output of `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, the command should be updated to `['fish', '--version']`. This will ensure that the correct version information is extracted from the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now successfully retrieve the Fish shell version.

Make sure to update the `info` function in the `fish.py` file with the corrected version provided above to pass the failing test.
