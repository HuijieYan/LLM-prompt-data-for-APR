## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. However, the way it is implemented is incorrect. The `Popen` command is using the wrong command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to get the version of the Fish shell, and it is not matching the expected output (`fish, version 3.5.9`). This results in a failing test.

## Bug Cause
1. The `Popen` call is using the incorrect command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to get the version of the Fish shell.
2. The `assert` statement in the test is expecting the output in the format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output from the `info` function is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, which leads to the assertion error.

## Fix Strategy
1. Correct the command in the `Popen` call to properly get the version of the Fish shell.
2. Modify the return statement in the `info` function to match the expected output format.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(", version ")[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We use `['fish', '--version']` in the `Popen` call to get the version information of the Fish shell.
- We then extract the version number from the output using `split(", version ")` and return it in the format `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`. 

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and return the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
