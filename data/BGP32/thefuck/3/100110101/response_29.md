## Fixing the bug

### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` might not correctly output the version string.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the output of this command is not the version number alone but includes additional text (`fish, version`) which is causing the comparison in the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to only output the version number. We can modify the command to simply be `fish --version`, which will correctly output the version number alone.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    raw_version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = raw_version.split(' ')[-1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract the version number from the output of `fish --version` and return it as expected.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test by providing the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
