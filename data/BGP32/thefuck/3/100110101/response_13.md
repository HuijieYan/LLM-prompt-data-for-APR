The bug in the provided function `info` is in the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is incorrect as it returns a different output than expected, leading to the failing test.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not output the Fish shell version correctly.
2. The expected output from the test function is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current command results in `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. This mismatch in the expected and actual output causes the assertion error during the test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish shell version should be corrected to match the expected output of the test function.
2. The correct command would be `'fish', '--version'`, which will return the desired shell version as string without extra information.
3. Updating the command to `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` will provide the correct Fish shell version.

### The corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By making this correction to the `info` function, the test should pass successfully with the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
