### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the command being run (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not return the correct version format, leading to the incorrect output.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The command being executed is not returning the correct version format.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` might not be handling the output correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) which does not return the version in the expected format. This leads to the incorrect version being extracted and returned by the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version correctly. We should change the command to `fish --version` which provides the version number in the correct format. Additionally, we need to adjust how we read and handle the output to extract the version correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    # Extract the version number from the output using regular expression
    match = re.search(r'version (\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', version)
    if match:
        version = match.group(1)

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The corrected version of the function now correctly executes `fish --version` to retrieve the version information and extracts the version number using a regular expression. This will ensure that the function returns the correct version format as expected by the test.
