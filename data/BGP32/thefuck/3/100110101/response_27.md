### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and extracting the version information. However, the command used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the command used in the test (`fish --version`). This mismatch causes the function to return unexpected output and fail the test.

### Bug:
The bug is in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function executes `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` while the test expects `'fish --version'`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the function needs to execute the correct command (`'fish --version'`) to get the version information of the Fish shell. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `'fish --version'` in the `Popen` call, the function will correctly extract the version information and return the expected output.
