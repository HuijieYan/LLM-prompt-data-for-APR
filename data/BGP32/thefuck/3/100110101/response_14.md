### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. The problem lies in the command being run; it should use `--version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This discrepancy causes the mismatch in the returned version compared to the expected output.

### Bug
The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. Instead of using `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, the correct command should be `'fish --version'`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed by `Popen` to `'fish --version'` in the `info()` function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])  # Extract only the version number
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve and format the version information, aligning with the expectations during the failing test.
