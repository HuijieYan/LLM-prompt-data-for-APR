## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test case provided sets the `side_effect` of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, which does not match the expected output format of the version string.

## Error
The error occurs because the function is trying to format the version string from the command output directly, but the output includes extra information ("fish, version") that is not part of the version number.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract and format the version number from the command output by parsing out the actual version number.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying the fix above to the `info` function, it should now properly extract and format the version number from the command output, satisfying the expected input/output values.
