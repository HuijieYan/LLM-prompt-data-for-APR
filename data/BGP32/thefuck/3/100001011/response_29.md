### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using `Popen`.
2. The function is intended to return the name of the shell concatenated with its version.
3. The reported issue indicates that running `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the mentioned function.
4. Based on the runtime values, it seems like the function might be getting stuck in an infinite loop or the stdout reading process is not working correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect usage of `proc.stdout.read()` function, which is leading to the function not being able to read and decode the version information properly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the version is read from the process stdout correctly and without causing any issues with infinite loops. Additionally, we should handle any errors that might occur during this process to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        return "Fish Shell (version unknown)"
```

In the corrected version, we add a try-except block to catch any potential errors that might occur during the version retrieval process. We read the version bytes separately and then decode them to get the version string. If any errors occur, we return a default message indicating the version is unknown. This should prevent the recursive loop issue and provide a more robust solution.
