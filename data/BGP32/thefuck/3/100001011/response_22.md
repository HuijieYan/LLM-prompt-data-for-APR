The bug in the provided function lies in the way the output of the subprocess is being read. The function is using `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to the function hanging if the process output is not fully available at the time of reading.

To fix this issue, we should add `proc.communicate()` after starting the process to ensure that we wait for it to finish before reading the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.communicate()` before reading the output, we make sure that the function waits for the process to finish, preventing any potential hanging issues. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin triggering a recursive loop.
