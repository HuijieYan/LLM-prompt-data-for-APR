### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `info` function arises from the way the stdout of the `Popen` process is read. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is called, but it returns a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the command. This leads to the incorrect version value being extracted and causing issues with the plugin initialization process, leading to a recursive loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should read the stdout of the `Popen` process as bytes using `communicate()` method and then decode it to get the version information accurately. This approach ensures that the actual output of the command is retrieved and used to determine the Fish Shell version.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the actual output of the command is captured and decoded correctly to determine the Fish Shell version. This correction should resolve the issue with the plugin initialization process in Oh-My-Fish related to the `thefuck -v` command.
