### Error Location and Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` which is blocking and causing a hang in the Fish Shell initialization process when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. This behavior triggers a recursive loop due to the way the function is trying to read the stdout.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the reading from `proc.stdout` in a non-blocking manner to prevent the hang in the Fish Shell initialization. Instead of using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`, we can use `communicate()` method which will communicate with the process without deadlocking us.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the function to use `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`, we should be able to fix the issue and prevent the hang in the shell initialization process.
