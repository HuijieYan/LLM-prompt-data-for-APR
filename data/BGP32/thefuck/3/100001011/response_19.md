### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the usage of `.read()` on the `stdout` of the subprocess can lead to potential issues, especially with the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue where it triggers a recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `.read()` method is being used directly on the `stdout` attribute of the Popen object without considering potential issues like deadlocks or recursive calls. This can lead to hanging behavior in certain scenarios, as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and prevent potential hanging issues, it's better to use `.communicate()` method on the Popen object, which will read the output and wait for the process to finish. This will ensure that the function does not hang and prevents any deadlock scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `stdout`, the corrected version addresses the hanging issue and ensures proper execution without causing any recursive loops.
