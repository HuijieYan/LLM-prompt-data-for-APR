### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, the issue on GitHub indicates that running the command `thefuck -v` hangs Fish Shell initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used. This suggests that the `info()` function may be causing a recursive loop due to how the version of the Fish shell is being fetched.

The problematic code seems to be related to how the version value is retrieved and formatted using `stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This could potentially lead to the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `Popen` process is initiated to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The output is read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which may cause issues and hang-ups during execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and prevent the recursive loop causing hangs during Fish Shell initialization due to the Oh-My-Fish plugin, we should consider a safer way to retrieve the Fish shell version without compromising the shell's stability.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell."""
    try:
        version = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL).communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `--version` argument is used with `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell.
- We use `communicate()` to retrieve the output of the command and decode it to a string.
- An exception handling block is added to catch any potential errors during the retrieval process.

By using `--version` and `communicate()` in the corrected version, we aim to avoid the recursive loop issue as reported in the GitHub issue and ensure the version retrieval process is more reliable and safe.
