### Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck/shells` directory. The function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through `Popen`. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that this command triggers a recursive loop when used in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

### Identification of Potential Error Locations
1. The use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the command executed by `Popen` might be the cause of triggering the recursive loop.
2. Reading the `stdout` of the process immediately without checking for potential issues or errors might cause unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
The issue likely stems from the fact that when invoking the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in Fish shell, it might attempt to evaluate the `$FISH_VERSION` within the current shell environment recursively. This can lead to an infinite loop when used in the context described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and prevent the recursive loop, we can modify the command executed by `Popen` to avoid triggering the recursive behavior. Additionally, we should handle potential errors that might arise during the process execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'printf "Fish %s" $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return version
    except Exception as e:
        return "Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed the command to `printf "Fish %s" $FISH_VERSION` to avoid triggering a recursive loop.
- Added a try-except block to handle any potential errors during the process execution.
- Returning the version itself rather than formatting it in the return statement for simplicity.

This corrected version should mitigate the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the recursive behavior when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
