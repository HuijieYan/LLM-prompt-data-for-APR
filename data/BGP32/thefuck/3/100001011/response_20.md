### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is using `Popen` to run a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell to retrieve the version of the shell.
2. The function then tries to read the output of the command and strip any whitespace characters.
3. The function is returning a string with the version information.

### Bug Cause:
The issue described on GitHub indicates a problem with the recursive loop triggered by using `thefuck -v` in Oh-My-Fish with TheFuck plugin. The problem is related to the `info` function in `shells/fish.py`. The function is executed in a way that seems to cause a loop that hangs the Fish Shell initialization.

The buggy function has an issue where it is not handling the `Popen` subprocess communication correctly, causing it to potentially hang and create a loop, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the communication with the subprocess to avoid any potential hanging issues. We should ensure that the subprocess is properly executed and the output is read correctly to prevent any loops or hangs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error: Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version"
```

In the corrected version:
- We replace `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()` to properly read the output from the subprocess.
- We add a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.
- In case of an error, we return a message indicating the failure to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

By making these changes, the function should now handle the subprocess communication correctly and prevent any potential hanging issues that could lead to a recursive loop as reported in the GitHub issue.
