### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` from the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` project is trying to fetch the version of the Fish shell by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, when the plugin `thefuck -v` is used in combination with Oh-My-Fish, it causes a recursive loop due to the way the version information is extracted.

### Potential Error:
The potential error in the code lies in how the version information is retrieved from the `proc` object. It seems that the code doesn't handle the case where the `proc` object might not have the correct data to read from.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the recursive loop when the plugin `thefuck -v` is used in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish due to the faulty implementation of fetching the Fish shell version from the `proc` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the version extraction mechanism is robust and that it handles all possible scenarios, including when the `proc` object is not properly populated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Fish Shell version not found"
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, we use a `try-except` block to handle any exceptions that might occur during the version retrieval process. We also utilize `proc.communicate()` to get the stdout data from the process. If there is an exception, we return a message indicating that the Fish shell version was not found. This approach ensures that the function is more robust and less prone to causing recursive loops as reported in the GitHub issue.
