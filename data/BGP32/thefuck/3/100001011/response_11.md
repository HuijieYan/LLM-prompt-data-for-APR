### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the version information is being extracted from the subprocess output.
2. Incorrect handling of subprocess output leading to a recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is the way version information is extracted from the subprocess output. The reading of the output using `proc.stdout.read()` is causing issues, especially in cases where the version information is not returned in a single read operation. This causes the function to hang, leading to a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, use `communicate()` method to get the output in a safe way without causing the function to hang.
2. Implement proper error handling in case of unexpected behavior during subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    out, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the function does not hang and correctly retrieves the version information without causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
