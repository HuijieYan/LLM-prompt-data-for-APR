## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `info()` function of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` project occurs because the function calls `Popen` to run the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the issue arises when the `thefuck -v` command is used in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This leads to a recursive loop due to the way the version is being fetched.

The `stdout.read()` method is getting mocked (`MagicMock`) in the test cases, which is not the actual behavior during runtime. This leads to incorrect values and types being recorded, causing the bug to persist.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the Fish shell version is retrieved to avoid the recursive loop triggered by the combination of `thefuck -v` and the Oh-My-Fish plugin. We can improve the process of fetching the Fish shell version by considering the environment variables available in the system.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Fish Shell Version not available"
```

In the corrected version, we use the `Popen` command with `['fish', '--version']` to directly fetch the Fish shell version without involving any environment variables that might trigger the recursive loop. We also use `proc.communicate()` to get the output from the process. Additionally, we handle any exceptions that might occur during this process and return a suitable message in case of an error.

This revised code snippet should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and prevent the recursive loop caused by the Oh-My-Fish plugin in combination with the `thefuck -v` command.
