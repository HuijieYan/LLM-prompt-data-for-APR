The root cause of the bug in the `info` function within the `fish.py` file is that it creates a deadlock due to the usage of `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to finish. This causes the function to hang when trying to retrieve the output of the process, leading to a recursive loop and deadlock in certain scenarios.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the process completes its execution before attempting to read its output. This can be achieved by adding a `proc.wait()` call after initiating the process, which will wait for the process to finish before moving on to read its output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` before attempting to read the output, we ensure that the process has completed its execution before trying to extract the output. This modification should prevent the deadlock issue observed in the buggy version.
