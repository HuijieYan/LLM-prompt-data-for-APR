### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the `Popen` command is being used.
2. Handling of the `stdout` from the `Popen` process.
3. Incorrect extraction of the version information from the output.
4. Possible issue with the format of the version string.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the way the `Popen` command is being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. It seems like the `proc` object is not being handled correctly, leading to potential issues with reading the version information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of the `Popen` object to retrieve the version information correctly.
2. Verify that the way the output is read and decoded from the `proc` object is correct.
3. Check the format of the version string to ensure it matches the expected output format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version uses the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object to retrieve the output and decode it correctly. It then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the version string before returning it. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
