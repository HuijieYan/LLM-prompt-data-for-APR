### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of TheFuck plugin for Fish Shell is attempting to retrieve the Fish Shell version using a subprocess call. The reported issue on GitHub indicates that when the `-v` flag is used in conjunction with TheFuck plugin, it can cause a recursive loop due to the `info` function. This suggests that the current implementation of the `info` function might be causing the plugin to hang during initialization when the `-v` flag is present.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
- In the subprocess call to retrieve the Fish Shell version using `Popen`.
- In the decoding of the stdout of the subprocess to get the version.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
Based on the information provided, the bug appears to be caused by the fact that the `info` function tries to retrieve the Fish Shell version using `$FISH_VERSION` while ignoring the potential presence of the `-v` flag. This leads to the function getting stuck in a loop when the plugin is initialized with the `-v` flag.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to handle the scenario where the `-v` flag is present or any other similar cases that might cause the recursive loop. We should update the subprocess call and handling of the stdout to ensure that the function can retrieve the Fish Shell version without causing conflicts with the plugin's initialization processes.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'if set -q FISH_VERSION;  echo $FISH_VERSION; else; fish --version; end'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the subprocess call is modified to check if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is set. If it is set, it will output the version using `$FISH_VERSION`. If not, it will fallback to using `fish --version` to retrieve the version. This approach ensures that the function can handle different scenarios appropriately and avoid issues with the plugin initialization.
