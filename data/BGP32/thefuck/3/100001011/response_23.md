### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the Fish shell in the `thefuck` Python package. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, but it fails to do so correctly. The bug causes a hang in the Fish Shell initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses the `-v` option with `thefuck`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the way the function tries to retrieve the version of Fish Shell. It uses `Popen` to execute a command to get the version, but the handling of the subprocess output is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The `info` function uses `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read and decode the output from the subprocess. However, when mocking this process in tests, the mock objects interfere, the expected output is not obtained, and the function fails to retrieve the correct version information. This leads to a hang during initialization as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the subprocess output is handled. We should use `communicate()` method of the subprocess instead of `read()` to ensure that the output is properly captured and decoded.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the subprocess output is captured correctly. This should resolve the issue of the function causing a hang during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin in the Fish Shell.
