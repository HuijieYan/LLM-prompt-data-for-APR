The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` package is caused by the cyclic dependency that occurs when the `thefuck -v` command is used, triggering the `info` function. This results in a recursive loop due to how the `Popen` and `stdout.read` methods are used to retrieve the version of Fish shell. 

To resolve this issue and avoid the cyclic dependency, we need to modify the function to obtain the Fish shell version without causing the recursive loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL).communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `Popen` with the `['fish', '-v']` command to directly get the Fish shell version.
- We then use the `communicate()[0]` method to get the output of the command without causing any recursion.
- Finally, we decode the output and strip any extra characters, returning the correct version of the Fish shell.

This modification should resolve the recursive loop issue caused by the original implementation.
