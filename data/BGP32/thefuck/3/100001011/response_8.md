### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when the plugin is trying to use `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish, it causes a recursive loop due to the implementation of `Fish.info()`. This suggests that the current implementation of the `info` function is not handling the version retrieval correctly, leading to the recursive loop.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The reading and decoding of the output from the `Popen` process may not be handled correctly.
2. The command being executed to get the Fish shell version might be causing an issue triggering the recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `info` function likely occurs due to the way the output from the `Popen` process is read and decoded. It seems that the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` may not work as expected, causing the `thefuck -v` command to loop recursively.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the command executed to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Ensure proper handling of the output from the `Popen` process.
3. Avoid any commands that may trigger a recursive loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- Updated the command to `['fish', '--version']` to get the Fish shell version.
- Used `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output from the process.
- Removed the problematic command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

This corrected version should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread and retrieve the Fish shell version accurately without causing a recursive loop.
