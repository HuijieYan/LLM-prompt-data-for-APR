### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the stdout of the `Popen` process may not be handled correctly.
2. The command being executed in the Popen process may not be capturing the Fish version accurately.
3. The decoding of the stdout output might not be working as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the provided runtime values and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the recursive loop triggered by the invocation of `thefuck -v` within the `Fish.info()` function. The current implementation fetches the Fish version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but this may not accurately capture the version information. Additionally, the way the stdout is read and decoded could also be contributing to the issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a more reliable method to retrieve the Fish Shell version.
2. Ensure proper handling of stdout reading and decoding to avoid any issues with the information retrieval.
3. Avoid triggering recursive loops in the context described by the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        if version.startswith('fish,'):
            version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        version = 'Unknown'
    
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version:
- The command `fish --version` is used to fetch the Fish Shell version more reliably.
- Proper handling of stdout reading and decoding is done using `proc.communicate()`.
- The version string is extracted and formatted appropriately to avoid issues.
- An exception block is added to handle any errors that may arise during the version retrieval process.
