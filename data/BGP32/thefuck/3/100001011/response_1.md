The bug in the provided function `info` is that it triggers a recursive loop when trying to get the version of the Fish shell using `thefuck -v`, leading to the system hanging. This issue has been reported on GitHub in the repository of Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the way the version of the Fish shell is obtained. We can change the command execution to retrieve the Fish version in a non-recursive way.

Here is the corrected version of the function `info`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command `fish --version` is used instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to directly get the Fish shell version without leading to a recursive loop in the system.
