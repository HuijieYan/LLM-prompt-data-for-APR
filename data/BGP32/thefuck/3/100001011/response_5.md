### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file reads the Fish version by executing a subprocess with `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to this exact function.
3. The function hangs due to the subprocess not being properly handled, leading to the recursive loop issue in the context of Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the subprocess created using `Popen`. The function does not wait for the subprocess to complete, leading to the hanging behavior and recursive loop issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to complete before proceeding and reading the output. This can be achieved by using the `wait()` function on the `proc` object to ensure that the subprocess finishes execution before reading the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()
    
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` after creating the subprocess, we ensure that the function waits for the subprocess to complete before reading the output. This fix should resolve the hanging behavior and the recursive loop issue reported on GitHub.
