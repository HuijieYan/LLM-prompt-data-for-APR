## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. However, there are potential error locations:

1. `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` is being called before waiting for the process to finish, which can lead to issues if the process hasn't completed execution.
2. There is no error handling for the subprocess execution.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation is that the function is trying to read the output of the process before it has finished executing. This can result in incomplete or missing data being read from the standard output.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, it is necessary to wait for the process to finish before reading its output. Additionally, it is recommended to include error handling to address any issues that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.wait()` is added to ensure that the function waits for the process to finish before reading its output. This will prevent any issues related to incomplete data retrieval.

Additionally, error handling can be added to check for errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.
