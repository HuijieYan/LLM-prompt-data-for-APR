### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, there are potential error locations within the function that may be causing issues:
1. The `Popen` function is used to run a command, but the output may need to be handled differently.
2. Reading the output using `proc.stdout.read()` can sometimes result in issues due to buffering or other factors.
3. The error handling or lack thereof for the process execution may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from directly using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output without checking if the process has terminated successfully. This can lead to issues with reading the output or handling the process execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of the process execution and output reading. This can be achieved by incorporating error handling and using `communicate()` method to handle the output and wait for the process to finish.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to capture the output from the process and wait for the process to finish. Then, the output is decoded and stripped to obtain the version of the Fish shell.
