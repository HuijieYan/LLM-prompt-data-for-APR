## Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command in a subprocess. The function uses `Popen` from the `subprocess` module to run the command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capture the output. However, the bug lies in how the function tries to read the output from the subprocess.

## Potential Error Location:
The error in the buggy function is present in how it reads the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This approach can cause issues if the subprocess output is large or not immediately available.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the fact that the `stdout` of a subprocess is buffered and needs to be handled properly to avoid potential hang-ups or delays. Reading directly from `proc.stdout` might lead to blocking if the subprocess output is large or the subprocess is still running. It is recommended to use `communicate()` method to handle subprocess output properly instead of directly reading from `stdout`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to utilize the `communicate()` method of the subprocess to communicate with the child process. This method reads the output both stdout and stderr in a non-blocking way and waits for the process to finish. By doing this, we can prevent any potential blocking issues due to large output or delays.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    
    # Read output from the subprocess using communicate to prevent blocking
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function utilizes the `communicate()` method to properly read the output from the subprocess and avoid any potential blocking issues.
