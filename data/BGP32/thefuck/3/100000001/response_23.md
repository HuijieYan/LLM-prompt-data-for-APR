### Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess and capturing the output. However, there are potential error locations within the function:
1. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is used to read the output from the subprocess, but it could lead to issues if the subprocess output is large or if there are encoding problems.
2. The `proc` object is not being checked for errors or if the subprocess executed successfully.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function arises from directly reading the output from `proc.stdout`, which may lead to encoding issues or incomplete output retrieval if not handled properly. Additionally, there is no error handling or checking for the subprocess execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of the subprocess output and implement error checking for the subprocess execution. It is recommended to use `proc.communicate()` to retrieve the output and handle potential encoding issues. Additionally, error handling should be implemented to check the return code of the subprocess.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            raise Exception("Error executing subprocess")
    except Exception as e:
        return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate()` to get the stdout and stderr of the subprocess.
- Check the return code of the subprocess and raise an exception if it is not successful.
- Implement error handling with a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during subprocess execution.
