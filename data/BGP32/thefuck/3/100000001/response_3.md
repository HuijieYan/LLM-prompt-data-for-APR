### Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The subprocess.Popen function is used to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and retrieve the output. The problematic part is the way the stdout.read() method is called after the subprocess is executed.

### Potential error:
1. Calling proc.stdout.read() directly without checking the return code or waiting for the process to finish executing could lead to incomplete or missing output.
2. Using `stdout.read()` to read the output without considering the process completion status.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by reading from the `stdout` of the subprocess before it has completed. This can make the function return incorrect version information or fail to retrieve any output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to wait for the subprocess to complete before reading from its `stdout`.
2. Implement error handling to account for any issues that may arise during the subprocess execution.
3. Use communicate() method to get the output and error streams.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
