## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell) by executing a subprocess and extracting the version information. However, the bug lies in handling the stdout from the subprocess which causes the function to malfunction.

## Potential error locations:
1. Using `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish.
2. Incorrect handling of subprocess stdout.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function trying to read the stdout of the subprocess before it has finished executing. This can lead to incomplete or empty output being read.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish executing and then read the stdout to ensure we get the complete output. Additionally, we should handle any errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return f'Error retrieving Fish shell version: {e}'
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. The `communicate()` method is used to wait for the subprocess to finish and capture the stdout and stderr.
2. Exception handling is added to handle any errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.
