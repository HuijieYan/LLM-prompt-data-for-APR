### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using the `Popen` subprocess. However, the issue lies in how the function reads the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read()`.

### Potential Errors:
1. Reading from `proc.stdout` without handling potential blocking issues.
2. Not handling possible errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to read the output from the `proc.stdout` before consuming the process properly. This can lead to a potential deadlock where the function waits indefinitely to read output from the process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure proper handling of reading the output from the process and also account for any potential errors that may arise during the subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception accordingly, e.g., logging the error
        return 'Failed to retrieve Fish shell version'
```

This corrected version includes error handling by wrapping the subprocess execution in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur. It also uses `proc.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout` to avoid potential blocking issues.
