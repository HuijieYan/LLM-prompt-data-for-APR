The buggy function provided is attempting to execute a command in the Fish shell to retrieve the version number of the Fish shell and return it as a string. The potential errors in this function are related to how the subprocess is created, how the output is retrieved, and potential issues with error handling.

The cause of the bug lies in how the subprocess output is read. The `proc.stdout.read()` function reads from the output of the process but it does not wait for the process to complete, which may result in incomplete or missing output.

To fix the bug, we should use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to complete and retrieve the output. Additionally, it is important to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return u'Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In this corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to complete and retrieve the output. We also added exception handling to catch any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.
