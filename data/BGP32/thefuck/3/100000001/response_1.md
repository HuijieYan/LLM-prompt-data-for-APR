### Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. However, there are potential error locations in this code:
1. The function does not explicitly wait for the process to finish executing before trying to read the output.
2. There might be issues with reading the output from the `proc.stdout` and potentially stripping the whitespace.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function does not wait for the process to finish executing before trying to read the output. This can lead to an incomplete or empty output being read, resulting in the incorrect version of the Fish shell being displayed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function waits for the process to finish executing before reading the output. This can be achieved by adding `proc.wait()` after running the command. Additionally, we should handle potential errors that may occur during the execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish executing
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version: {}".format(e)
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. Added a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution.
2. Added `proc.wait()` to ensure the process finishes executing before reading the output.
3. Returned an error message if any exceptions are raised during the process.
