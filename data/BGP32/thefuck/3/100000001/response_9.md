The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using the `Popen` from the subprocess module. However, the bug lies in how the output of the command is being read and processed.

### Error Cause:
The issue in the buggy function is that it is using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the subprocess command, but it is missing handling for potential deadlocks. When using `proc.stdout.read()`, it is a blocking call that waits for the standard output to be fully read, which can lead to deadlocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the output of the subprocess command is read to avoid deadlocks. We can achieve this by using `communicate()` method provided by the `Popen` object, which will read the stdout and stderr streams and wait for the process to terminate.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()`, we ensure that the function does not lead to deadlocks while reading the subprocess output. This corrected version should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without the risk of deadlocks.
