The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through a subprocess and capturing the output. The potential error locations within the function are related to handling the subprocess output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to read the stdout of the subprocess directly without waiting for the process to complete, which can result in an incomplete or empty output being returned.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to ensure that the subprocess completes before reading its output. This will guarantee that the version information is correctly retrieved.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In this corrected version, the `communicate()` method is called on the `proc` object, which waits for the process to complete and returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr outputs. We then extract and decode the stdout to get the correct version information.
