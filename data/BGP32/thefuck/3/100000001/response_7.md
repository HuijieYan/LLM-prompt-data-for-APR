## Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell by running a command through the subprocess module.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()` might not read the complete output if it's large.
2. The decoding of the output might fail if it contains non-UTF-8 characters.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function is that it attempts to read the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which can lead to incomplete output or errors during decoding if the output is not in UTF-8 format.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object to capture the complete output.
2. Specify the encoding and handle any potential decoding errors.
3. Add error handling to cover cases where the subprocess might fail.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    try:
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        return "Failed to decode the output"
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error occurred: {}".format(e)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to capture the complete output and adding error handling for decoding and subprocess failures, the corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust solution.
