1. Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using subprocess Popen. However, there is a potential error in reading the output from the subprocess.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error lies in reading the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which might not return the correct output due to buffering or encoding issues.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the communication with the subprocess properly, leading to incorrect output reading or potential blocking issues.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should properly communicate with the subprocess, handle the output reading, and ensure proper decoding of the output to fetch the correct version of the Fish shell.

5. Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the function by utilizing the `communicate` method to interact with the subprocess and decoding the output correctly:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to interact with the subprocess and get its output. Then, the output is decoded correctly to get the version of the Fish shell without any potential issues related to buffering or encoding.
