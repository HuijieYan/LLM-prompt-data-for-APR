## Fixing the Buggy Function

### Step 1: Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to run a command to get the Fish Shell version. However, the current implementation is buggy and may lead to issues.

### Step 2: Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error in the current implementation lies in the way the output of the process is read. Specifically, the code accesses `proc.stdout` directly after starting the process, which may not have the output available immediately.

### Step 3: Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The bug in the current implementation occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` is blocking and may not have the complete output available when called immediately. This can result in an empty string being returned, causing issues when trying to extract the version from an empty string.

### Step 4: Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to complete and ensure that the output is available before reading it. One way to achieve this is by using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and retrieve the output.

### Step 5: Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the process to finish, retrieve the output, and the output is then decoded and stripped to extract the version. This should prevent the earlier issue of reading the incomplete output.
