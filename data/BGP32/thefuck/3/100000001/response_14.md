## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to run a command in the Fish shell and capture the output. The issue with the current implementation is related to how the output is being read and decoded.

## Potential error locations:
1. Reading the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read()`.
2. Decoding the output using `decode('utf-8')`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the current implementation is caused by reading the output of the process before it has completed. The `proc.stdout.read()` method reads from the stdout stream of the process, but it does not wait for the process to finish executing. This can lead to incomplete or empty output being read and decoded.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we wait for the process to finish executing before reading and decoding its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method provided by the `Popen` object, which allows us to interact with the process and receive its output after it has completed.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and return both the stdout and stderr streams. We then decode the stdout output to get the version of the Fish shell and return it as the formatted string `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`.
