The bug in the provided function is that it tries to read from the stdout of the `Popen` process before it completes, potentially resulting in an empty string being read.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Reading from `proc.stdout` before the process has completed.
2. Not handling the decoding of the output string properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` process is not guaranteed to have completed when the code tries to read from its stdout. This can lead to an empty string being read, causing issues in returning the correct version.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the process has completed before reading from its stdout. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to complete and returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method to wait for the process to complete and get the stdout output. Then, we decode the output properly before returning the version information.

This fixes the bug by ensuring that we only read from the stdout of the `Popen` process after it has completed, thus avoiding any potential issues with empty or incomplete output.
