## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. It then reads the output from the process and formats it into a string to return as the shell information.

## Errors:
1. The function is not closing the process after it reads the output, which might lead to resource leaks.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` before closing the process correctly might lead to incomplete or incorrect results.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not closing the process after reading the output from it. This can potentially lead to resource leaks as the process is not terminated properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the process is closed after reading the output. We can also use the `communicate()` method provided by the `Popen` class to handle the process input/output and close it properly.

## Updated and Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.wait()  # Make sure to wait for the process to terminate
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to handle the process input/output and close it properly. Additionally, we wait for the process to terminate using `proc.wait()` to ensure proper cleanup.
