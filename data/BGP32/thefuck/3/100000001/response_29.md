### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` attempts to get the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell) by running a subprocess command. However, the bug lies in how the function tries to read the output from the subprocess.

### Identified Issue:
The issue is that the `proc.stdout.read()` call is blocking and reading from the pipe before the command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) has completed, leading to potentially incomplete or incorrect output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` is reading the output before it is fully available, resulting in an incomplete or empty string being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should use `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the subprocess to finish and then read the output. This ensures that the subprocess has completed before attempting to read its output.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the subprocess finishes executing before we attempt to read its output. This will prevent any issues related to incomplete or incorrect output.
