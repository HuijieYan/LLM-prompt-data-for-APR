## Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command. It uses `Popen` to run the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and reads the output. The issue in the buggy function lies in how it handles reading the output from the subprocess.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`.
2. Decoding the output using `decode('utf-8')`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by directly reading from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the subprocess to finish producing output. This can result in empty or incomplete output which causes decoding errors. Additionally, decoding the binary output without considering if it's complete can lead to decoding issues.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish, then properly read and decode the output to prevent any decoding errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the subprocess to finish and return the output and error streams. Then, we properly decode the output to a string and strip any whitespace before returning the version.
