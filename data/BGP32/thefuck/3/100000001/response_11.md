### Analysis:
The provided function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. However, there are potential error locations within the function that can lead to bugs:
1. The `Popen` object `proc` is created but not waited for to ensure the completion of the command execution, which can cause issues.
2. The function attempts to read from `proc.stdout` directly without waiting or handling any potential errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is caused by not waiting for the `Popen` process to complete before attempting to read from its `stdout`. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the `Popen` process to complete its execution before attempting to read from its `stdout`. This can be achieved by calling the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a call to `proc.communicate()` after creating the `Popen` object to wait for the process to complete. Then, we correctly read the output from `stdout` and decode it before returning the version information.
