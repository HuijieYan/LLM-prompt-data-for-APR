### Analysis:
The buggy function tries to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command through subprocess Popen. The output from the command is read using `.stdout.read()` and then decoded to get the version string. However, there is a bug in the code that can potentially cause issues with reading the output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the stdout directly without waiting for the process to finish.
2. Possible encoding issues while decoding the output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the code arises from reading the stdout without waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to incomplete or missing output, resulting in an empty version string being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should wait for the process to finish before reading the stdout to ensure that we get the complete output. Additionally, we should handle any encoding issues that may arise while decoding the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip() if version_bytes else 'Unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we added `proc.wait()` to ensure that the process finishes before reading the stdout. We also added a check to handle the case where the version string may be empty. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
