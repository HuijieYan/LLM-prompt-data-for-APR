### Analyzing the Buggy Function:

The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through the subprocess module. It then reads the output of the command and formats it to return the name and version of the current shell.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function might not be handling the subprocess properly, causing issues in executing and reading the output of the command.
2. There could be a problem with reading the output from the subprocess.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function lies in the way the output from the subprocess is being read. The `proc.stdout.read()` method reads the output once and may not capture the complete output if it's produced in chunks, leading to an incomplete or incorrect version being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output from the subprocess is handled correctly, especially if the output is produced in chunks. One way to do this is by using `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which provides a more robust way to read the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to interact with the subprocess and read the output. This ensures that the complete output is read and returned accurately.
