### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell but is not handling the subprocess properly. This can lead to potential issues with reading the output of the command executed.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. Not handling the subprocess `proc` properly.
2. Reading the output of the subprocess `proc` without handling it correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from not correctly reading the output of the subprocess which can result in an empty or incorrect version being returned.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the subprocess by waiting for the process to complete and then read the output to ensure that we get the correct version of the fish shell.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the subprocess to finish and get the stdout output. Then we correctly decode and strip the version, ensuring that we return the correct result.
