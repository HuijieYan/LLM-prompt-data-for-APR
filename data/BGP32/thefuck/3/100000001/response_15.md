1. The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, it fails to properly handle the subprocess output and decoding resulting in potential errors.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - Issue with reading subprocess stdout.
   - Decoding error when converting subprocess output to UTF-8 string.
   - Error handling in case of exceptions or errors during subprocess execution.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug occurs because the function is directly reading the `stdout` of the subprocess without properly handling potential decoding errors or exceptions that may arise during the subprocess execution.
   - Additionally, directly calling `read` on the `stdout` without checking for any errors may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Include proper error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during subprocess execution.
   - Use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess to obtain the output and error streams.
   - Decode the output stream using proper error handling to avoid potential decoding errors.
   - Implement a structured error handling mechanism to ensure robustness.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "An error occurred while retrieving the Fish Shell version: {}".format(e)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now includes a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.
- It uses the `communicate()` method to obtain the output and error streams of the subprocess.
- The output stream is properly decoded using UTF-8 encoding with error handling to prevent decoding errors.
- If any exception occurs during execution, an error message is returned instead of crashing the function.
