The buggy function `info()` is attempting to fetch the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` from the subprocess module. The issue with the current implementation is that the function is not waiting for the command to finish execution before trying to read from `proc.stdout`. This can lead to an empty or incomplete output being read, resulting in an inaccurate version information.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function waits for the command to complete and then reads the output correctly before returning the version information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have used the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the command to finish execution and capture both the stdout and stderr outputs. Then, we decode the stdout output to a string and extract the version information before returning it in the desired format. This modification ensures that the version information is retrieved accurately.
