### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to run a command in the Fish shell and get the version information. However, there are potential error locations in the current implementation:
1. Reading from `proc.stdout` without closing the process.
2. The `read()` method might not read the complete output if it's too large.
3. The code assumes that the output will be in UTF-8 encoding.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function is related to reading from the `proc.stdout` without closing the process created by `Popen`. This can lead to resource leaks and incomplete output reading.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `Popen` process should be closed after reading from its stdout. Additionally, it's better to read the output line by line and decode it properly to handle different encodings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    out, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.wait()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Used `proc.communicate()` to read the stdout and stderr data.
2. Decoded the output using `decode('utf-8')`.
3. Called `proc.wait()` to properly close the process and wait for it to complete.

This corrected version should fix the bug and handle the potential issues in the initial implementation.
