The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' using subprocess Popen and then reading the output from the process. The bug in this function is related to fetching the output from the process properly.

The issue lies in how the output is being read from the process. The current implementation uses `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` which may not capture the complete output due to buffering or other reasons.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to communicate with the process and retrieve the output after the process has completed. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the fixed version, the `proc.communicate()` function is used to wait for the process to complete and then retrieve the output. This ensures that the complete output from the process is read correctly.

By making this change, the function should now accurately return the name and version of the Fish shell without any issues.
