## Analysis:
The provided function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. While the logic seems correct, there is a potential issue related to reading the output from the subprocess.

## Potential Error:
The potential error in the function lies in reading the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`. The `read()` method might read only a part of the output or fail to read anything if the process is not yet completed.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reading from the subprocess before it has completed execution, leading to incomplete or empty output being retrieved.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can wait for the subprocess to complete its execution before reading its output. This can be achieved by using the `proc.communicate()` method which waits for the subprocess to finish and then returns a tuple of stdout and stderr data.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the subprocess to finish and properly read its output. This ensures that the version information is retrieved correctly from the Fish shell.
