## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell using `Popen`, but it is not handling the communication with the process properly, leading to potential hanging issues.
2. The expected input is the command `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version of Fish shell.
3. The bug is likely due to not properly handling the process communication and reading the output from the `proc.stdout`. This can lead to the process hanging when trying to read the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly wait for the command to finish execution and then read the output from the process.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the command to finish and retrieve the output, we ensure that the function does not hang and correctly captures the version of the Fish shell.
