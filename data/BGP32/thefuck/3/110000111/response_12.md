## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. However, there is a bug in the function that causes it to hang in certain scenarios, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `proc.stdout.read()` operation hangs when trying to read the stdout of the `Popen` process in certain conditions, causing the function to freeze. This issue is triggered by the use of the `-v` flag in the `thefuck` plugin, leading to a recursive loop.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and prevent the function from hanging, we should ensure that the `Popen` process is properly closed after reading its output. This can be achieved by calling `proc.communicate()` after the read operation to wait for the process to finish and clean up any resources.

## Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to finish and clean up
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.communicate()` after reading the output, we ensure that the `Popen` process is properly closed, preventing the function from hanging. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
