Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class is caused by reading from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process incorrectly. The function is trying to read from `proc.stdout` multiple times without resetting the file pointer, which can lead to empty reads and incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` method to read the output of the process only once and properly handle any errors that may occur during the process execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Failed to get Fish Shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

This corrected version of the function reads the output of the process using `proc.communicate()` which reads and returns the output as well as any error messages in a tuple. This approach ensures that the output is read only once and parsed correctly.

By implementing this fix, we address the bug in the `Fish.info` method and ensure that it returns the expected values while also resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.
