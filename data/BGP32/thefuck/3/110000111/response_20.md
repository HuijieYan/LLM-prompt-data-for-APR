## Analysis
- The `info` function is using `Popen` to run a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. 
- The issue seems to be related to a recursive loop triggered by using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish's plugin.
  
## Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of `Popen` output.
2. Lack of error handling for the case where `Popen` fails to execute the command.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the way the `info` function is trying to capture the output of the command. If there is an issue with executing the command using `Popen`, the function does not handle it properly. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, possibly contributing to the recursive loop described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Implement proper error handling for the `Popen` call to capture any exceptions or errors that may occur when running the command.
- Update the way the output is read from the `Popen` process to ensure it is correctly captured.
- Check for any specific conditions related to Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin requirements to prevent triggering any recursive loops.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error while fetching Fish shell version: {e}")
            return "Fish Shell (Unknown)"
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the `Popen` command execution.
- Used `proc.communicate()` to get both stdout and stderr streams.
- Decoded the stdout stream to get the version information.
- Added a simple print statement to log any errors that occur during the process.
- If an error occurs, the function returns "Fish Shell (Unknown)" as a fallback.
