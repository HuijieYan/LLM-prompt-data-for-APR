## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call but is not handling the process and stream correctly which results in a hanging process.
2. The function calls `Popen` to execute a command to get the version of the shell.
3. The bug causes a hanging process when trying to read the version from the subprocess output. This is due to not handling the communication properly with the subprocess.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper communication with the subprocess process, reading the output correctly, and handling errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version above, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to correctly read the output of the subprocess and `proc.communicate()[1]` can be used to read the error output if needed. This should resolve the hanging process issue.

This fix ensures proper communication with the subprocess, reads the output correctly, and helps in avoiding the hanging issue reported in the GitHub issue.
