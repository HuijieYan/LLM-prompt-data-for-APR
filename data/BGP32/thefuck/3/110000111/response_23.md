Based on the provided information about the issue and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the bug in the `Fish.info()` function arises from calling `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to complete. This causes the function to hang when trying to read the output.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish executing before attempting to read from its output. We can achieve this by adding the `proc.wait()` method after creating the process.

Here's the corrected version of the `Fish.info()` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly wait for the process to complete before reading its output, preventing the hanging issue reported in the GitHub bug.
