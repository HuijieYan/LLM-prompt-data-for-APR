## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). The bug arises from the fact that the subprocess `Popen` command does not properly capture the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 

The issue on GitHub suggests that the current implementation of `info` in the `Fish` class causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is run with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin. This loop stems from an incorrect behavior in the `info` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function correctly captures the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and returns the version of the Fish Shell without causing a recursive loop. We can modify the function to properly handle the subprocess output and provide the correct version.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.communicate()[0]
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the usage of `proc.stdout.read()` with `proc.communicate()[0]` to properly capture the output of the subprocess command. This change ensures that the function retrieves the version of the Fish Shell correctly without causing any recursive loops. This corrected version should address the issue raised on GitHub and provide the expected output for the function.
