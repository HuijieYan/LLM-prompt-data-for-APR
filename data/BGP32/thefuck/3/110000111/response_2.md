Based on the provided information, the issue occurs because the `info` function in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` project is creating a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used. This is due to improper handling of the output from the Popen subprocess call, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `Popen` subprocess call is properly handled to prevent the recursive loop. The output from the subprocess needs to be correctly decoded and returned as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function within the `Fish` class:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `proc.communicate()[0]` method is used to read the output of the subprocess call. This method waits for the subprocess to finish and returns a tuple containing the output data and errors.

By making this change, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve and return the Fish Shell version without causing the recursive loop issue when using the `thefuck -v` command in Fish Shell.
