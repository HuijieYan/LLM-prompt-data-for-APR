Based on the GitHub issue provided, the problem seems to be related to the use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop. This is happening due to the `info` method in the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file not handling the subprocess call properly.

The issue can be resolved by modifying how the output of the subprocess is read in the `info` method of the `Fish` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        
        # Correct way to read the output from the subprocess
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the subprocess output is read properly. This correction should prevent the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the `info` method should now handle the subprocess call correctly and return the expected output as described in the test case.
