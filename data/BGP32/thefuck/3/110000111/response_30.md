Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the modified file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.stdout.close()  # Close the stdout to prevent hanging
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation:

#### Bug:
The bug in the original function arises from not closing the `proc.stdout` after reading from it. This causes the function to hang and trigger recursive loops when the `thefuck -v` command is executed with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

#### Fix:
The fix involves adding `proc.stdout.close()` after reading from it to prevent the hang.

By closing `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the function properly handles the subprocess, reads the version information, and then closes the stdout stream to prevent any hanging issues.

This corrected version of the function should address the hanging behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
