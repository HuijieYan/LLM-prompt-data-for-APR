To fix the bug in the `info` function in the `Fish` class, we need to address the issue that the `Popen` process is not handled correctly. As per the description of the bug, using the `thefuck -v` command causes a recursive loop, which likely results from the stdout reading process of the `Popen` object not being properly handled.

The key change required is to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the output and handle the process completion properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish Shell without causing any recursive loops or issues when using the `thefuck -v` command.
