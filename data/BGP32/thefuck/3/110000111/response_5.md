## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then parsing the output. However, it is not handling the process creation correctly.
2. The current implementation does not handle the `Popen` object correctly, leading to potential issues in accessing the stdout and reading the output.
3. The bug causes the function to hang or enter into a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed by Oh-My-Fish plugin due to improper handling of the `Popen` object.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves properly handling the `Popen` object, capturing the stdout output correctly, and handling potential errors that may occur during the process creation.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `info` function, the `Popen` object needs to be managed properly, the stdout output should be read correctly, and any potential exceptions should be handled. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Fish Shell version retrieval failed: {}".format(str(e))
```

In this corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate()` to read the stdout and stderr of the process.
- Errors that occur during the process creation or execution are caught and handled by returning an error message.
- The function should now properly retrieve the Fish shell version without hanging or causing recursive loops.
