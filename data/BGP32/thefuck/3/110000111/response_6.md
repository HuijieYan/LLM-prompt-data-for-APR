## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class, which is part of the `fish.py` file in the `shells` directory.
2. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
3. The function uses `Popen` from the `subprocess` module to execute the command.
4. The bug seems to be related to the function hanging during the execution of the command.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug causes a recursive loop issue when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The bug could be related to how the output of the subprocess is read and decoded.
2. There might be an issue with how the command is executed causing it to hang.
3. The bug might also be due to how the stdout data is retrieved.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug can be attributed to how the `Popen` command is executed in the Fish shell environment. When executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, the function might be hanging at the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line. This could be due to how the standard output is being read or a delay in retrieving the version information.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess command executes smoothly and the output is captured correctly without causing the function to hang. We can try to handle the standard output more efficiently and consider any potential delays in retrieving the version information.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()  # Use communicate instead of reading directly
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version"
```

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()[0]` to get the output of the subprocess command instead of directly reading the stdout. This should prevent the function from hanging and ensure that the version information is fetched correctly. Additionally, we've added exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during the execution of the command.
