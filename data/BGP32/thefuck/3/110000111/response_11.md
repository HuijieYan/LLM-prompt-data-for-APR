## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of Fish shell by running a subprocess command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the plugin uses the command `thefuck -v`, it causes a recursive loop because of the way the version of Fish shell is retrieved.
3. The cause of the bug is that the subprocess command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is creating a recursive loop when the plugin uses `thefuck -v`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to find a different approach to retrieve the version of Fish shell that does not cause a recursive loop.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can directly capture the version of the Fish shell without using a subprocess call that triggers a recursive loop. We can access the environment variables directly to get the version information.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the environment variable `FISH_VERSION` using `os.getenv`, we avoid the recursive loop that was caused by running a subprocess command to get the Fish shell version.
