Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class from `fish.py` is due to the way the `Popen` subprocess is being handled. Specifically, the `proc.stdout.read()` function is causing the script to hang when trying to read the output.

The issue described on GitHub explains that the recursive loop is triggered by `thefuck -v`, which uses the `info` function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This recursive behavior is likely caused by the `proc.stdout.read()` method blocking the execution.

To fix the bug, we can modify the way the output of the subprocess is read to prevent the script from hanging. We will use `communicate()` method to interact with the process without blocking.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without causing a hang or a recursive loop.
