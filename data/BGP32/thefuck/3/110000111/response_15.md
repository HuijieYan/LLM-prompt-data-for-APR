Based on the information provided, the bug in the `Fish.info()` function is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read()` and `.decode('utf-8')` on the Popen object before checking if the process has finished. This can lead to a hang when trying to read from the process output. To fix this issue, we should wait for the process to finish before reading from its output.

Below is the corrected version of the `Fish.info()` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` after starting the process with Popen, we ensure that the process finishes before reading from its output. This should prevent the hang issue described in the GitHub bug report and provide the correct version number of the Fish shell.
