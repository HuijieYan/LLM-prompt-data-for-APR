To fix the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class, we need to ensure that the `Popen` object is properly handled and the stdout is read correctly. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `Popen` object and not reading the output from the process properly.

Here's a corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The corrected version of the function reads the stdout from the `Popen` process using `proc.communicate()` method, which ensures that the process output is read correctly.
2. By using `proc.communicate()`, we retrieve both the stdout and stderr values, but in this case, we are interested in the stdout only.
3. The stdout is then decoded to a string and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
4. The function now returns the proper formatted string with the version of the Fish shell.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `info` function should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without causing any recursive loops as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
