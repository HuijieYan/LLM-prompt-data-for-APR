Based on the information provided, the bug in the `info` function is likely due to using `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to complete. This can lead to blocking behavior and potential deadlocks, especially if the process output is not fully available before trying to read it.

To fix this bug, we can use `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to complete and return both stdout and stderr. This approach will prevent any potential blocking issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly wait for the process to complete before reading its output, avoiding any potential blocking issues.
