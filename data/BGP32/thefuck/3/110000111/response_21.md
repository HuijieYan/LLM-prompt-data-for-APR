To fix the bug in the `info` function within the `Fish` class, we need to handle the correct reading of the output from the `Popen` process and ensure that it does not cause any recursive loop.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to properly handle reading from the `Popen` process output.
2. Add error handling to prevent potential recursive loops and ensure that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Updated import statement with Generic
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version_bytes, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Error retrieving Fish shell version: {e}'
        
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
    
```

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `info` function should properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and avoid the potential recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
