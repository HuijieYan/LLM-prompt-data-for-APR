The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is reading the output of the `Popen` process by directly calling `proc.stdout.read()`, which is leading to the hanging issue described in the GitHub bug report. The hanging behavior is due to reading the output from the process without handling potential stalls.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we retrieve the output from the process by utilizing the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        # Use communicate() method to read the output
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()`, we ensure that the process output is correctly obtained. The usage of `communicate()` method ensures proper handling of potential stalls and hangs.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the hanging issue described in the GitHub bug report while still returning the expected output as specified in the test case.
