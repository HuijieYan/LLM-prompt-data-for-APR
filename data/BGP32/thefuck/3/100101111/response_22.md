### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell. However, the command used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the command expected in the test case (`fish, version 3.5.9`). This mismatch causes the test to fail.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The expected version is `3.5.9`, but the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return this format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the expected version format and the command used to retrieve the version in the `info` function. This results in the function not returning the correct version string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to match the expected format (`fish, version X.X.X`).
2. Parse the output of the command to extract the version number correctly.
3. Update the return statement to include the extracted version number.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", version ")[1]
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `--version` command to retrieve the Fish shell version in the expected format. It then extracts the version number from the output and returns the correct version string.
