### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell to retrieve the version information.
2. The test case provided tries to mock the stdout read to simulate the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then compares the expected version string with the output from the `info` function.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the version information is extracted and formatted, causing a mismatch with the expected output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from the fact that the function is not extracting just the version number from the command output but the entire string containing both "fish" and the version number.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract and format only the version number from the command output, ensuring that it matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
``` 

By extracting only the version number from the output and formatting it correctly, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
