### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `info(self)` in `fish.py` has an issue where it's trying to retrieve the Fish Shell version but not parsing it correctly. This causes the failing test `test_info` to fail as it expects the output to be `Fish Shell 3.5.9` but gets a different result due to incorrect parsing.

The function uses the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version of the Fish shell, but it needs to correctly extract and format the version number.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the Fish Shell version output. The function simply outputs the whole response from the command without parsing out the version number. This leads to the failing test as the expected output format does not match the actual output.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract the version number from the Fish Shell response and format it appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extracting the version number
    version = version_output.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version output based on the format `"fish, version "` and taking the second part, we can correctly extract the version number. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output `Fish Shell 3.5.9`.
