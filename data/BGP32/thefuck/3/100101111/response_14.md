### Analysis
1. The `info` function in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version from `fish --version`.
2. The test is setting the return value of `stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is not matching the expected value of `'3.5.9'`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to this discrepancy.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function and the expected command in the test case. This leads to an incorrect comparison between the version strings and fails the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version within the `info` function to match the expected output in the test case.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the function retrieves the version in the expected format. Splitting the output by whitespace and selecting the third element allows us to extract just the version number.
