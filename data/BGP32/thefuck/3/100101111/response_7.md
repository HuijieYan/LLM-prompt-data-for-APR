### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The command used in `Popen` might not be correct. It should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. The extraction of the version from the output might be handled incorrectly.
3. The comparison between the extracted version and the expected version needs to be verified.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is mainly due to the incorrect command used in `Popen`. This leads to fetching an incorrect output that does not match the expected version string. Additionally, the extraction of the version from the output is not properly handled, leading to the incorrect comparison with the expected version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the command passed to `Popen` to fetch the version using `--version` flag.
2. Properly extract the version from the output fetched by `Popen`.
3. Compare the extracted version with the expected version to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(' ')[-1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version should now properly extract the version from the output fetched by `Popen` and compare it with the expected version string.
