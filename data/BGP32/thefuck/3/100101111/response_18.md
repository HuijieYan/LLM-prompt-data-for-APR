### Analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is not correctly extracting the Fish Shell version from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. There is a discrepancy between the actual output value retrieved and the expected value, causing the failing test. The expected version value should be extracted from the output of the command.

### Bug Cause
The bug is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The command used `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not output the version in a directly usable format, leading to the incorrect value extraction.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to query for the Fish Shell version. We should use `fish --version` instead, which directly outputs the version information.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected function fixing the buggy behavior
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, the command used to get the Fish Shell version is changed to `fish --version`, and then the version is properly extracted from the output. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
