### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (`Fish Shell <version>`).
2. The function is using `Popen` with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version.
3. The failing test is set up to mock the output of `Popen` to simulate the version retrieval process.
4. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with `thefuck -v` causing a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug in the `info` function stems from the mismatch in the command used with `Popen` and the expected output from the mocked `Popen` call in the test.
- The actual version output from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` includes extra text like `'fish, version'` which is not expected.
  
### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` to correctly retrieve just the version without any additional text. We also need to update the expected output in the test function accordingly.

### Corrected Code
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Test
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
``` 

By correcting the `Popen` command and adjusting the expected version extraction, the function should now return the correct version without the extra text, resolving the bug.
