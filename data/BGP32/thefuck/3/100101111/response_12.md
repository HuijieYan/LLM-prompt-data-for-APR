### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test sets up a scenario where the shell output contains both the shell name and version.
3. The bug causes the function to concatenate 'Fish Shell' with the entire output 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of extracting just the version number.
4. The bug is related to how the version number is extracted from the shell output.
5. The failing test expects the version number '3.5.9' to be extracted and formatted correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `info` function arises from not properly extracting just the version number from the shell output. Instead of only extracting '3.5.9' from 'fish, version 3.5.9', the function includes the 'fish, version' part in the final output, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the shell output is parsed to extract only the version number and format it appropriately before returning.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output based on ", version " and taking the second part, we can extract only the version number for proper formatting. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
