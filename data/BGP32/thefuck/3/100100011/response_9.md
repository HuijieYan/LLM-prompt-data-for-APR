## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the Fish Shell by executing a command and parsing the output. However, the command used to fetch the Fish Shell version is incorrect, which leads to the test failing.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Command used to fetch the Fish Shell version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) might be incorrect.
2. Assertion in the test may not align with the output of the command.


## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish Shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not provide the version correctly, which causes the test to fail. Additionally, the assertion in the test expects the command `['fish', '--version']`, but it's not being executed correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish Shell version should be corrected to `fish --version` to obtain the version accurately. Furthermore, the assertion in the test should be updated to match this corrected command.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command `'fish --version'` is used to fetch the version of the Fish Shell accurately. Additionally, the output parsing is updated to extract the version number correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
