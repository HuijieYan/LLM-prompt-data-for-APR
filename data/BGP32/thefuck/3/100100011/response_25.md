### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the test provided in `test_fish.py` specifies that the version is retrieved using `fish --version`, which is causing the test to fail.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command should be modified to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The original command in the `info` function was incorrect, which led to a discrepancy with the expected command in the test. This mismatch caused the test to fail as the output from the incorrect command did not match the expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to `['fish', '--version']` in the `info` function to match the expected command in the test. This modification will ensure consistency between the function implementation and the test expectations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the `info` function will correctly fetch the Fish shell version using `['fish', '--version']`, resolving the discrepancy with the test case and allowing the test to pass successfully.
