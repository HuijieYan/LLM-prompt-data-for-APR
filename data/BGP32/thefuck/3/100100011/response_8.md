### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test is mocking the response as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` which indicates that the correct command to get the version is `'fish --version'` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The bug causes an infinite loop due to wrong shell command being used in the Python code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by using an incorrect command to fetch the Fish shell version within the `info` function. This discrepancy causes `info` to hang, leading to the observed issue on GitHub.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `'fish --version'` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After implementing the corrected version, the `info` function should now properly retrieve the Fish shell version using the correct command and avoid the loop issue faced by the GitHub user.
