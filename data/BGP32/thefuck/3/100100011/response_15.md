The issue with the `info()` function in the `fish.py` file is that it is trying to get the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but in the failing test case, it is expecting the version to be fetched using `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to fetch the Fish shell version in the `info()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```

Explanation of changes:
- Updated the Popen command to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to fetch the Fish shell version correctly.
- Removed the comma and whitespace from the version string obtained from `proc.stdout` before returning the version information.

With this correction, the `info()` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell as expected by the failing test case.
