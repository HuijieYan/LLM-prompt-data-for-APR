## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The test function in `test_fish.py` mocks the output of `Popen` to simulate the command output.
3. The failing test expects the `info` function to return the correct version of Fish shell ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and also checks the command passed to `Popen`.

## Error Locations:
1. The command being run in `Popen` is incorrect (['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']) and does not retrieve the version correctly.
2. The test is expecting ['fish', '--version'] to be passed to `Popen`, which is incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The incorrect command used in `Popen` leads to the failure in fetching and decoding the version of Fish shell.
2. The expectation mismatch in the test for the command passed to `Popen` further exacerbates the issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in `Popen` to correctly fetch the version of Fish shell.
2. Update the test expectation for the command passed to `Popen` to reflect the corrected command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version changes the command to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the correct version of Fish shell. Additionally, the test expectation for `Popen` command is updated to reflect this change.
