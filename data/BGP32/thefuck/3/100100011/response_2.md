After analyzing the buggy function, test code, and the GitHub issue, the main issue is that the `info` function is calling `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but the test code is expecting the version information to be retrieved using `fish --version`. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command in the `Popen` call within the `info` function to match the command format expected by the test. 

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function now correctly retrieves the version information from `fish --version`, matching the expectation of the test function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test that expects `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
