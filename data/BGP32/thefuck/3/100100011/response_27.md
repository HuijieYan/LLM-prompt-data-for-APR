The bug in the `info` function of the Fish shell module is that it is retrieving the version information by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`, which is causing the test to fail. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the command used to fetch the Fish shell version in the `info` function to `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell using `fish --version`, which will make the test pass successfully.
