## Analysis:
- The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the Fish Shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. 
- The test function in `test_fish.py` is mocking the output of the command to be `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is expecting the output to only be the version number.
- The issue on GitHub mentions that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop because of the `info` function causing the shell initialization to hang.

## Potential Error Location:
1. Incorrect command to retrieve Fish Shell version.
2. Improper parsing of the shell version from the command output.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. It is not handling the full output of the command which includes extra text.
The test is mocking the correct version, but the function is not handling the parsing correctly, leading to a failed assertion.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `info` function to simply `fish --version` to get the Fish Shell version directly.
2. Modify the parsing logic to extract only the version number from the command output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version is changed to `fish --version`, and the parsing logic is updated to extract only the version number from the output.
