## Identification of Potential Errors:
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the fish version is incorrect, as it should be "fish --version" instead of "echo $FISH_VERSION".
2. The test case expects "fish --version" but the function is returning the result of "echo $FISH_VERSION".
3. The decoding and stripping of the output might not be handled properly, leading to incorrect results.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The test case expects the version to be retrieved using "fish --version" but the function is actually trying to retrieve the version using "echo $FISH_VERSION". This inconsistency leads to the test failing.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the Popen command to use "fish --version" to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Handle the decoding and stripping of the output properly to ensure the correct version is extracted.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With the corrected version of the function, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is updated to "fish --version". The output is then properly decoded, stripped, and split to extract the version number. This should now return the correct version and pass the failing test.
