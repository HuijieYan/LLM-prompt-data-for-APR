### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is responsible for determining the version of the Fish Shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and extracting the version number from the output.
2. The test function `test_info` in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock `Popen` object to mimic the output of the `fish --version` command and then compares the expected version with the version obtained by calling `shell.info()`.
3. The bug occurs because the command passed to `Popen` in the `info` function is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but the test checks for `['fish', '--version']`. This discrepancy causes the test to fail with incorrect output.
4. To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` in the `info` function should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the test's expectations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the `info` function to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, the bug will be fixed, and the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test.
