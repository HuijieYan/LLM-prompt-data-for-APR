The bug in the `info` function is causing the test case to fail because it is trying to read the output from the `fish` command with the argument `-c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the output it expects is the version number after executing `fish --version` instead.

The corrected version of the `info` function should be modified to execute `fish --version` to get the exact version number. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_info.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By running `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the correct version number can be obtained from the output. The test case provided should pass with this corrected version of the function.
