### 1. Analyze:
The buggy function `info()` in `fish.py` is extracting the Fish shell version by running a command using `Popen` but the test in `test_fish.py` is expecting the version number to be obtained using the command `fish --version`. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
The discrepancy between the command used in the function and the expected command in the test case is a potential error location.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the mismatch in the command used to extract the Fish shell version in the `info()` function and the command expected in the test case. This discrepancy results in the test case failing to assert the correct version.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` in the `info()` function should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the command expected in the test case. This will ensure that the expected version is extracted from the Fish shell correctly.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the function to use the command `['fish', '--version']`, the correct version of the Fish shell will be extracted, resolving the issue and allowing the test case to pass successfully.
