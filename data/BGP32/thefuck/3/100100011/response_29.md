## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, Fish Shell. It does so by executing a command to get the version number.
2. The issue pointed out on GitHub mentions that using the `-v` flag with `thefuck` plugin in Fish Shell causes a recursive loop due to the `info()` function in `fish.py`. This suggests that the bug lies in the way the version information is being retrieved.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function is caused because the command used to fetch the version of Fish Shell is incorrect. The command used is `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, while the correct command should be `'fish --version'`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the command within the `Popen` call to fetch the Fish Shell version correctly.
2. Update the test function to match the correct command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function in shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After correcting the function in `fish.py`, the test function in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` should pass with the updated command:
```python
assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
