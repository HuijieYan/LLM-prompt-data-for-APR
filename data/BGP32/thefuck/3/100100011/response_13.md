### Analysis:
The buggy `info` function in `fish.py` shell file is intended to return the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess and extracting the version information. However, the implementation is incorrect as it is using the wrong command to fetch the version and extracting it incorrectly.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command used in `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This command will not provide the proper version information since it is not equivalent to `fish --version`.
2. The extraction of version information from the subprocess output might be incorrect, causing a mismatch with the expected version in the test.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function's command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` fails to provide the correct Fish shell version, resulting in a failing test. Additionally, the way the version is extracted from the output of the subprocess may not be accurate.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the subprocess command to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the correct version information.
2. Modify the extraction method to parse the correct version from the output obtained by running the subprocess command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Now, by using the `--version` flag in the subprocess command and modifying the version extraction method, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test successfully.
