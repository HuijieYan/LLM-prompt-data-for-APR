### Analyzing the bug:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a scenario where the command output is `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` but the comparison is expecting `version 3.5.9` instead.

### Potential error locations:
1. Command execution not providing the expected output.
2. Incorrect decoding or stripping of the output.
3. Mismatch in the comparison logic.

### Cause of the bug:
The primary cause of the bug lies in the mismatch between the expected output in the test and the actual comparison logic in the `info` function. The command output format is not properly handled, leading to failure in the comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the test setup to provide the expected output format.
2. Adjust the processing of the command output in the `info` function to strip unwanted characters and format correctly for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version:
- The command `['fish', '--version']` is used instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` for accurate version retrieval.
- The `version` parsing is adjusted to split by `,` and select the version part, ensuring compatibility with the test scenario.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
