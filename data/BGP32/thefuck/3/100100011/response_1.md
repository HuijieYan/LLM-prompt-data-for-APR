## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the Fish Shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The test function `test_info` in `test_fish.py` sets up a scenario where the expected output of the command is `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The test checks if the output of `shell.info()` matches `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and if the command used by `Popen` matches `['fish', '--version']`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that using the command `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop, which is likely related to the information retrieval strategy of the shell's version.

## Error Locations:
1. The command used in `Popen` to retrieve the Fish Shell version is different from the one expected in the test.
2. The decoding method for the stdout of the process can cause issues with decoding the output correctly.

## Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used in `Popen` (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command in the test (`['fish', '--version']`).
2. Additionally, the decoding of the stdout may not work as expected, leading to incorrect version retrieval.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command in `Popen` to be `fish --version` to match the expectation in the test.
2. Use `proc.communicate()` method to correctly read the output of the process.
3. Ensure proper decoding of the output to avoid any decoding issues.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version using the appropriate command and decode the output accurately. This should address the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that the test `test_info` passes successfully.
