### Analysis:
- The `info` function in `fish.py` is utilizing the `Popen` method to get the version of the Fish Shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
- The test case specifically sets up `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to return the output of `fish, version 3.5.9\n`, which is not matching with the command in the `info` function.
- The assertion for `Popen.call_args[0][0]` in the test case is expecting `['fish', '--version']`, which is not aligned with what is actually being executed in the `info` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the command being used in the `info` function and the expected command in the test case. The `info` function is trying to get the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` while the test case is checking for `['fish', '--version']`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to align the command used in the `info` function with the expected command in the test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version:
- The `Popen` command is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected command in the test case.
- The version extraction is updated to handle the output format `fish, version 3.5.9\n` correctly.
- The return statement is modified to include the extracted version number.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and align with the expectations of the test case.
