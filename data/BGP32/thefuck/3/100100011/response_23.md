## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the command to extract the version is incorrect based on the failing test.
2. The failing test expects the command `['fish', '--version']` to be used instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. The failing test sets the return value of `Popen` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, indicating that the correct command to get the version should be `['fish', '--version']`.
4. The issue on GitHub explains that using `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop because of how the version is retrieved in the `info` function.

## Bug Fixes:
1. Modify the command used in the `Popen` function to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected command in the failing test.
2. Update the function to correctly read and format the version returned by the shell command.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove 'fish, version ' prefix
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the above fixes, the corrected function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell as expected by the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
