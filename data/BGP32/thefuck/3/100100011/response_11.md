## Analysis:
The buggy function is `info()` in the `fish.py` file. It uses `Popen` to run a command to get the Fish Shell version. The bug is due to the incorrect command used to get the version, leading to a mismatch with the test case `test_info()`.

## Identified Errors:
1. The command used to get the Fish Shell version is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the expected command in the test case is `fish --version`.
2. The assertion in the test case for the command arguments `Popen.call_args[0][0]` does not match the actual command used in the function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `info()` function is running the wrong command to get the Fish Shell version, leading to a mismatch in the expected output and failing the test case. The test case checks for the correct command arguments, but the function is not using the expected command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `info()` function to `fish --version` to match the test case. Additionally, we need to ensure that the test case assertion for the command arguments is correctly set to `[0][0]` to match the corrected command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the function above, it should now correctly fetch the Fish Shell version using `fish --version` and pass the failing test case.
