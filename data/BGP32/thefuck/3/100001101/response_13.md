### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the function is not handling the case where the command fails or produces no output, leading to potential issues.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case where the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` fails to produce any output. This results in an empty string being returned as the version, which is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the command fails or produces no output. We can check if the `proc` object has a non-empty stdout before attempting to read it. If the stdout is empty, we can return a default value for the version.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip() if stdout else 'Unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we use the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and get both stdout and stderr. We then check if the stdout is not empty before decoding it to get the version. If the stdout is empty, we return 'Unknown' as the default version. This ensures that we handle the case where the command fails or produces no output.
