### Analysis
The bug in the provided function lies in the way it extracts the version information from the output of the command. The function is currently extracting the version along with the shell name, which causes the output to be incorrect.

### Error location
The error is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. It reads the output as a string and includes the shell name in the version, instead of just extracting the version number.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output to extract only the version number. This results in the returned version including the shell name, causing a mismatch with the expected output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for extracting the version information. We should only extract the version number from the output and exclude the shell name.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output based on spaces and taking the last element, we ensure that we only extract the version number from the output. This corrected version should now produce the expected output based on the provided test case.
