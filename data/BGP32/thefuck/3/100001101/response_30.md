The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the output of the Popen subprocess. It is trying to read the stdout of the process using `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish executing. This can cause the function to read an empty string or incomplete output.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object which waits for the subprocess to finish and returns a tuple of stdout and stderr. We can then extract the stdout from this tuple.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version will correctly capture the stdout of the subprocess, ensuring that the version is extracted properly. This should align with the expected values and types provided in the failing test case.
