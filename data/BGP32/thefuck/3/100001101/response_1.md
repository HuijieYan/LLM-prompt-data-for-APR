### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. The issue likely lies in how the version is extracted from the command output since the expected version does not match the actual version in the test case.

### Error location
The error is likely in how the version is extracted from the command output using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The incorrect prefix 'Fish Shell' is also being added to the version.

### Cause of the bug
The function is fetching the entire output of the command which includes the prefix 'fish, version'. It then adds 'Fish Shell' to the version string, causing it to be incorrect.

### Fix strategy
1. Modify the command to only return the version without any prefix.
2. Update the string formatting to avoid adding 'Fish Shell' prefix.

### Corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return version
``` 

This corrected version will only extract the version number without any prefixes, ensuring it matches the expected output.
