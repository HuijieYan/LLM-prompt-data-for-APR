### Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using subprocess. However, the function is not correctly extracting and formatting the version information from the command output, leading to an incorrect version string being returned.

The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is expected to output the version of the Fish shell, such as `fish, version 3.5.9`. The bug lies in the parsing and formatting of this output to extract only the version number without any additional text.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly processing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which contains both the text "fish, version" and the version number. The function is not isolating and formatting only the version number before returning it.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This can be achieved by splitting the output string and taking the last element which represents the version number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version will properly extract and format the version number from the command output before returning it as the shell name and version.
