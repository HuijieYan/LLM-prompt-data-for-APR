### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function lies in not handling the version string properly when extracting it from the shell command output. The current implementation includes the 'Fish Shell' prefix in the version string, which is not expected in the output. 

### Error location
The error is in the line where the version is extracted from the shell command output:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is extracting the complete output of the shell command without removing the unnecessary 'Fish Shell' prefix from the version string. This leads to incorrect version information being returned.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify how we extract the version information from the shell command output. We should extract only the numeric part of the version without including the 'Fish Shell' prefix.

### Corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip().split(' ')[1]  # Extract only the version number from the output
    return version
``` 

The corrected version of the function now correctly extracts only the version number without including the 'Fish Shell' prefix. This modification ensures that the function returns the expected version information.
