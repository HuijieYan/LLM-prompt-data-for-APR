### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, the version extracted includes unnecessary information like "fish, version" which needs to be removed. The function is returning the version with the unnecessary prefix, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from not removing the unnecessary prefix "fish, version" when extracting the version information from the output of the command execution.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to strip the unnecessary prefix from the version information before returning it.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Remove the unnecessary prefix
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the version information by the comma and removing the extra spaces, we ensure that only the version number is returned without any unnecessary prefixes. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
