### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the subprocess output and extracting the version.

### Error location
The issue lies in how the function is reading and decoding the subprocess output to extract the version.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly extracting the version from the subprocess output. The function is capturing the output using `proc.stdout.read()`, but failing to properly handle it to retrieve the version information.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output from the subprocess is properly decoded and parsed to extract the version information.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function properly decodes the subprocess output and extracts the version information by splitting the output based on ',' and taking the last part which contains the version number. Now the function should return the expected version information.
