### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function lies in how the `Popen` object is being used to capture the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The `read()` method of the `stdout` property is not being used correctly, resulting in the incorrect handling of the version information.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a `MagicMock` object instead of the actual output of the executed command.
2. The `decode('utf-8')` method is trying to convert the `MagicMock` object to a UTF-8 encoded string, which is causing the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly read and decode the output from the `Popen` object to get the actual version information of the Fish shell.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `read()` method correctly, the `version` variable will now store the actual version information of the Fish shell, resolving the bug.
