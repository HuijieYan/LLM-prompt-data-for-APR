The bug in the provided function stems from reading the output of Popen directly without waiting for the process to finish properly. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect output being read, causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function should wait for the Popen process to finish before reading its output. This can be done by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to finish and then returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish, the function will correctly read the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and return the expected shell version information.
