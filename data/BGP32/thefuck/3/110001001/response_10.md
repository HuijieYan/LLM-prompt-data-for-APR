### Analysis
1. The function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output.
2. The `Popen` class is used to run a command in a subprocess.
3. The `stdout` attribute of the `Popen` object is used to read the output of the command.
4. The function then decodes the output as a string and formats it to return the shell name and version.

### Bug
The bug in the function is related to how the output of the subprocess command is being read and handled. The function is trying to read the output from `proc.stdout`, but it seems to be using `MagicMock` objects instead of the actual output data. This indicates that the subprocess command execution is not producing the expected output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess command is executed properly and its output is captured correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        if output:
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        return "Fish Shell (unknown)"
``` 

This corrected version captures the output of the subprocess command using `proc.communicate()` and decodes it, ensuring that the actual output data is read and processed correctly. If there's no output, the function returns a default message "Fish Shell (unknown)".
