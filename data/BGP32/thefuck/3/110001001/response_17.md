## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (in this case, Fish shell). However, the bug lies in how the function handles reading the shell version from the subprocess.

### Issues
1. The reading of the subprocess stdout is not being done correctly, causing the returned version to be incorrect.
2. The function does not handle error situations where the subprocess may fail to execute or provide the version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly read the output of the subprocess to get the version information.
2. Add error handling to deal with cases where the subprocess fails.

### Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Error retrieving Fish shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` to read the output and adding proper error handling with a `try-except` block, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell or handle errors appropriately.
