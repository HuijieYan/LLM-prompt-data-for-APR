### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the handling of the subprocess output seems to be incorrect, leading to potential issues in retrieving the version information.

### Identified Bug
1. The `read` method is being called on `proc.stdout` directly, which may not retrieve the entire output due to the subprocess still running.
2. The decoding of the output using `utf-8` might not work correctly depending on the content of the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to securely read the entire output of the command.
2. Handle the decoding of the output properly to avoid any encoding issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the complete output of the subprocess is read and decoded correctly to retrieve the Fish shell version information.
