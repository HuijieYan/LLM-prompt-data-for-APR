### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to using a MagicMock object instead of an actual subprocess.Popen object to execute the shell command. This results in the `proc` object not functioning as expected and causing errors when trying to read the output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary modules at the beginning of the file.
2. Replace the MagicMock object with a subprocess.Popen object to properly execute the shell command and retrieve the output.

### Corrected version:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from thefuck.utils import DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the subprocess.Popen is used correctly to execute the shell command and fetch the output.
