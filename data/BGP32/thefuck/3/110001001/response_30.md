### Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in how the output is being read from the `Popen` object. The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns a `bytes` object, not a `str` directly, so trying to decode it directly will lead to decoding errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Instead of calling `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`, we should use `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8')` to properly decode the output.
2. We should also handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of `Popen`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version due to error: {}'.format(e)
```
