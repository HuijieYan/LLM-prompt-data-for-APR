### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, it seems that the process is not being executed correctly, as indicated by the `proc` variable being a MagicMock object instead of a subprocess.Popen object. This could be the reason for the incorrect output.

### Bug
The bug in the function is likely related to the subprocess execution not working as expected, resulting in the `proc` variable not being a valid Popen object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we can add `shell=True` as an argument in the `Popen` call to ensure that the shell is used when executing the command. This should resolve the issue with the subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
