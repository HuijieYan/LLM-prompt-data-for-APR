### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through a subprocess. The issue seems to be related to how the subprocess output is being read and decoded.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely lies in the way `stdout` is being read and interpreted. When trying to read from `proc.stdout`, it returns a `MagicMock` object instead of the actual output of the subprocess. This leads to an incorrect version value being extracted and returned.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess output is read and decoded properly. We can achieve this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which correctly waits for the process to finish and then captures both stdout and stderr. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()`, we ensure that the output is read correctly, decoded, and returned as the actual version of the Fish shell.
