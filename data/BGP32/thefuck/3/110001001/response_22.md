### Error Location
The error is likely occurring when trying to read the output from the `proc.stdout` object.

### Cause of the Bug
The issue lies in how the output from `proc.stdout.read()` is being handled. In the provided code, the `stdout` is being read using `proc.stdout.read()` before calling the `communicate()` method on the subprocess to ensure the full output is read. This can lead to partial or incomplete output being read.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is essential to capture the full output from the subprocess by replacing `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` with `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8')`. This change ensures that the entire output is read before decoding it.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
