### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the issue lies in how the function is attempting to read the output of the subprocess. It is using `proc.stdout.read()` directly without waiting for the process to complete, which can lead to an empty or incomplete output being read.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function tries to read from the stdout of the subprocess before it has completed executing, resulting in an incomplete or empty output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to wait for the subprocess to complete before reading its output. This can be done by using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function properly waits for the subprocess to complete before reading its output, preventing any incomplete or missing information.
