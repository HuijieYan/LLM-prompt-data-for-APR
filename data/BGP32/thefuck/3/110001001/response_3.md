### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to how the output of the `Popen` process is being read and processed. The `proc.stdout.read()` seems to be returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the process.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by accessing the `proc.stdout.read()` directly without waiting for the process to finish and return the actual output. The MagicMock objects are placeholders used in unit testing and are not the actual output of the process.

### Fix
To fix this issue, you need to wait for the process to finish and then read its output. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the `proc.wait()` before reading the output, we ensure that the process has completed and the output is available to be read. This should fix the issue with the MagicMock objects being returned.
