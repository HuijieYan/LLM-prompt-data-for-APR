### Bug Explanation
The issue in the buggy function `info` is that it reads the output from the subprocess `Popen` using `proc.stdout.read()` but forgets to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading the output. This can lead to the `proc.stdout.read()` method returning empty or incomplete output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish executing before attempting to read its output. We can achieve this by calling the `communicate()` method on the `Popen` object, which waits for the subprocess to finish and then returns a tuple of `stdout` and `stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo', '$FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the subprocess to finish and then retrieve the output. This ensures that we get the complete output from the subprocess, avoiding any issues with incomplete or empty output.
