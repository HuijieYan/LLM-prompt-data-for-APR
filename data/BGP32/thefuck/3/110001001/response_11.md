### Analysis
The problem lies in how the output from the `Popen` process is being read and processed. The `proc.stdout.read()` function returns a `bytes` object, which needs to be decoded into a string using the `decode('utf-8')` method before stripping any whitespace.

### Bug
The bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` is a `MagicMock` object, likely due to incorrect mocking in the test environment. This is causing the decoding and stripping operations to fail and return incorrect values.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `proc.stdout.read()` function returns a `bytes` object representing the output of the `Popen` process. We can modify the function to correctly decode the byte stream into a string and then strip any whitespace.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to read the output of the `Popen` process and then decode it into a string before stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This should fix the bug caused by the incorrect type of `proc.stdout.read()` and provide the correct version value for the Fish shell.
