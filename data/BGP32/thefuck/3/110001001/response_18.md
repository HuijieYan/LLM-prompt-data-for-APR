### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `info` function stems from the usage of a MagicMock object in place of the actual subprocess call. This causes the function to return incorrect information about the Fish shell version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a proper subprocess call is made to retrieve the Fish shell version, instead of using MagicMock objects. We should also handle any errors that might occur during the subprocess call.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Unable to retrieve Fish shell version due to error: {}".format(str(e))
```
