The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, the way it reads the output of the subprocess is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that running `thefuck -v` hangs the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin because of a recursive loop triggered by `Fish.info()`. This loop is likely caused by the way the `info()` function handles the output of the subprocess.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function reads the output of the subprocess and extract only the version number without any additional information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output and extracting the last element (which should be the version number), we ensure that we are only returning the version number without any extra text that may cause issues with the subsequent operations. This fix should address the problem reported on GitHub and correctly provide the expected version output.
