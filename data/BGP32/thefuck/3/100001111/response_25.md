Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the expected values and types during the failing test execution, it seems that the issue lies in retrieving the version of the Fish shell. The current implementation includes the shell name "fish" along with the version when retrieving it, causing a mismatch with the expected output values.

To fix this bug, we need to parse the version information correctly and update the formatting in the return statement. We should only extract the version number without including the shell name.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version will properly extract and return only the version number of the Fish shell without including the shell name. This change aligns with the expected output values and addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding recursive loop triggers during initialization in Fish Shell with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
