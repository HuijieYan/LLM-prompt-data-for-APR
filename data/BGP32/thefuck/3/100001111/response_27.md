### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is using `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell, but it is not handling the subprocess correctly, leading to potential issues with the output. The Buggy function seems to be extracting the version from the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` but not fully processing it correctly.

The `runtime values` show that variables `version`, `proc.stdout.read`, and `proc.stdout` are not displaying the expected values for the successful execution of the function. The issue seems to be related to how the version is extracted and formatted.

The `expected values` indicate the correct values for the variables at the function's return. Therefore, the bug needs to be fixed by properly extracting and formatting the version before returning it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from not properly handling the subprocess output and extracting just the version number from the output. This can lead to incorrect formatting and incomplete version extraction, causing discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version from the output of the subprocess. We should read the output from `Popen` correctly and then extract just the version number from it. We also need to strip any extra characters or spaces to ensure the version is clean.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By incorporating the additional code to clean up the version extraction, we ensure that only the version number is returned in the correct format. This should fix the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected outcome, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
