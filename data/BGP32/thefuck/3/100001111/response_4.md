There are several issues present in the buggy function:

1. The function is not correctly extracting the version information from the `fish` shell command output.
2. The function does not handle the case where the version information includes extra text ("fish, version") that needs to be stripped.
3. There is a potential issue with the mocking setup in the test environment.

To fix the bug:
- Use `communicate()` method instead of `read()` to retrieve the output from the Popen process.
- Modify the extraction of the version string to remove any unnecessary text.
- Ensure that the test environment is correctly configured to provide the expected values.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now properly extract the version information from the output of the `fish` shell command and handle any extra text in the version string.
