Based on the provided information, the bug stems from the fact that the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is appending "Fish Shell" to the version string obtained from the `fish` command, resulting in an incorrect format. This incorrect format causes issues when interacting with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the "Fish Shell" prefix and only return the version obtained from the command. This should align with the expected output and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

By returning just the version without the 'Fish Shell' prefix, this function should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected output.
