### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command in a subprocess. However, the way the output is processed seems to be causing an issue, leading to unexpected values being returned.

### Identified Error Locations
1. The decoding and stripping of the output from `proc.stdout.read()` are not handled correctly.
2. The format of the version string is not being extracted properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the output from the subprocess command. This is evident from the runtime values where the version string includes unnecessary information like "fish, version" which needs to be filtered out.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly process the output from the subprocess command to extract only the version number without any additional text.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove unnecessary text
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we remove the unnecessary text "fish, version" from the version string before returning it. This should ensure that only the version number is included in the output as expected.
