The bug in the provided function `info()` is due to the way it attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function is currently fetching the entire output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which includes additional information like the shell name 'fish' along with the version number. This causes the output to be in the format 'fish, version x.x.x' instead of just the version number.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function will properly extract and return only the version number from the output of the command, satisfying the expected output values provided.

By making this change, the function will now correctly return the version number of the Fish shell without including the shell name, resolving the issue related to the recursion triggered by the invalid output format.
