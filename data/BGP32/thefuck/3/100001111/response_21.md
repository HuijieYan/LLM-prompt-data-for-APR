Based on the GitHub issue and the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the recursive loop triggered by the use of the -v flag in the `thefuck` plugin with Fish Shell and Oh-My-Fish. The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is causing the recursive loop due to how it retrieves the version of Fish Shell.

The issue seems to be that when executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the Popen process, the output includes more information than just the version number (e.g., 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'). This extra text causes the recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin uses `thefuck -v`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to only return the version number without any additional text.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('Fish Shell ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version extracts only the version number by removing 'Fish Shell ' from the output. This change should prevent the recursive loop issue with the `thefuck` plugin and provide the expected output without any additional text.
