The buggy function is the `info` method in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It does so by executing a command in the Fish shell to retrieve the value of the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the way it reads the output from the `Popen` process. The function reads the output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which might be causing issues with extracting the correct version number.

The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of the output stream from the `Popen` process. In the failing test execution, the `version` variable seems to contain both "fish, version" text along with the version number. This indicates that the decoding and stripping process is not working correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are correctly capturing just the version number from the output of the Fish shell command. We can modify the function to extract only the version number and eliminate any additional text.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now correctly extract just the version number from the Fish shell output and return it along with the shell name. This fix should address the issue reported on the GitHub page regarding the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
