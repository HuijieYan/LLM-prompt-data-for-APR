### Analysis:
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command. However, the way the function processes the output of the subprocess command seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing a hang in certain scenarios.

### Error Location:
The issue likely lies in how the function reads and processes the output of the subprocess command. The current implementation is reading the entire output at once, which may not be efficient and could potentially result in a hang.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely occurs because the `proc.stdout.read()` method is not being handled properly, causing the function to hang.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should read the output of the subprocess command line by line and concatenate it to form the version string. This approach should prevent the function from hanging while retrieving the version information.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    
    version = ''
    for line in proc.stdout:
        version += line.decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By iterating over the lines of the subprocess output, the corrected version of the function should now properly retrieve the Fish shell version without causing hangs. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
