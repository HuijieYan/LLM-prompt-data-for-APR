Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function within the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project arises from the fact that the version string extracted from the `fish` command output includes additional text that needs to be trimmed to match the expected value. This discrepancy results in the failing tests and the issue described in the GitHub problem.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns a string that includes extra text besides the version number.
2. The expected version string only includes the version number without any additional text.
3. As a result, the extracted version is not matching the expected value, causing the tests to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish` command by parsing the version string correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number from the version string
    version_number = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By modifying the function to extract only the version number part from the `FISH_VERSION` output and then returning that number with the correct format, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now return the expected values in the failing test cases.
