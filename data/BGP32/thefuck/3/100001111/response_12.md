The bug in the provided function `info` lies in how it extracts the version information of the Fish shell. The function is currently extracting the entire string `fish, version 3.5.9` instead of just the version number `3.5.9`.

The issue on GitHub highlights that the current implementation results in a recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin in combination with TheFuck plugin, as it tries to regenerate functions based on the version information.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to only extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This updated version will correctly extract only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command before returning it with the prefix 'Fish Shell'. This fix addresses the bug and prevents the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
