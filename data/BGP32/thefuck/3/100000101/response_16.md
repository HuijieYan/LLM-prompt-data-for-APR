The bug in the provided function `info` is due to trying to read from `proc.stdout` before waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to race conditions and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading from `proc.stdout`. We can achieve this by adding `proc.wait()` before reading from `proc.stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will wait for the `fish` process to finish before reading from `proc.stdout`, ensuring that the correct version information is captured.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test case.
