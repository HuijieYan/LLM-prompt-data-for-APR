The bug in the provided function is due to the attempt to read from `proc.stdout` before the process has completed and data is available. This can lead to an empty or incomplete read, causing the function to return unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we can utilize the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which ensures that all output is captured and the process is completed before reading from it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    out, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function uses `communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and then reads the output data. This ensures that the function captures the complete output and processes it correctly.
