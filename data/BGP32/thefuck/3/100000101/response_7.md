### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the issue lies in reading the output from the `proc` object. The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns a bytes object, so decoding it using `decode('utf-8')` is necessary to convert it to a string. 

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that `proc.stdout.read()` is a bytes object, and calling `decode('utf-8')` on it requires calling the `splitlines()` method after the decoding process.

### Fix
Add the `splitlines()` method after decoding the bytes object to handle multi-line or trailing newline characters that might cause issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().splitlines()[0]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
