The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to read from the stdout of the Popen process immediately after running it without waiting for the process to finish. This can result in an empty or incomplete output being read.

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading from its stdout. We can achieve this by calling the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then return a tuple of stdout and stderr data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish, we ensure that the stdout data is complete and can be properly read and decoded. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
