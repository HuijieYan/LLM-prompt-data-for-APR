### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, the issue lies in how the function is handling the `proc` object, which is a `Popen` instance.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is not waiting for the process to finish before trying to read from its `stdout`. This results in the `stdout` being empty or incomplete, leading to an incorrect version being returned.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish executing before reading from its `stdout`. This can be achieved by calling the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to finish and get the output
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By utilizing the `communicate()` method, we ensure that the process has finished executing before attempting to read from its `stdout`, thereby fixing the bug.
