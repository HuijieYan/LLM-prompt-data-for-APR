### Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in how the stdout from the Popen process is being read. The function is using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the stdout of the process. However, the read() function reads from the current position of the buffer, and if the buffer is not positioned at the start, it might not read the entire output. This could result in an incomplete or incorrect value for the version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we read the entire output from the process's stdout.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    if proc.stdout:
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

This corrected version first checks if `proc.stdout` exists before attempting to read from it again. If the stdout exists, it reads and decodes the entire output to get the correct version value.
