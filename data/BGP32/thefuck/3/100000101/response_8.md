The bug in the provided function is due to `proc.stdout.read()` being called before the process execution is complete, leading to empty or partial results being read. To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading its output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function waits for the process to finish execution before reading the output. Now the function should return the correct version of the Fish Shell based on the expected input/output values provided.
