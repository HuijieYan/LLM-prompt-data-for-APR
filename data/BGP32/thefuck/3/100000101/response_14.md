### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to fetch the version of the Fish shell by running a command in the shell and reading the output. However, the bug lies in how the output is being read from the process created by `Popen`. The use of `proc.stdout.read()` directly can lead to unexpected behavior as it reads only once and may not capture the complete output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` reads the output only once, and if the output is larger than the buffer size, it might truncate the result. This can result in an incomplete version being retrieved and cause incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To correctly read from the output of the process created by `Popen`, it is better to use `communicate()` method which reads and returns the entire output. This ensures that the complete output is captured without truncation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `communicate()` method to read the output from the process created by `Popen`, the corrected version ensures that the complete output is captured without any truncation.
