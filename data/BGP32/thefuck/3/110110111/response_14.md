## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish Shell version by executing a subprocess command. However, the command used in the `Popen` call is incorrect.
2. The failing test is expecting the version string to be extracted correctly and formatted as 'Fish Shell X.X.X'.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output includes unnecessary additional information along with the version number.
4. To fix the bug, the subprocess command needs to be adjusted to correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version without additional information.
5. The corrected version of the function should correctly extract the version number and format it as 'Fish Shell X.X.X'.

## Updated Buggy Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(",")[1].strip().split()[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
```

By updating the command executed by `Popen` with `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version number accurately, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
