After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the root cause of the error is the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The current implementation uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which does not match the expected output format 'fish --version'. This inconsistency leads to a failure in the provided test case due to mismatched version strings.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command executed by Popen to retrieve the Fish Shell version correctly. By changing it to 'fish --version', we can ensure that the version output matches the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the necessary changes:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now successfully retrieve the Fish Shell version in the expected format. This fix addresses the issue outlined in the failing test by aligning the command used to retrieve the version with the test's expected output.

The corrected function should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
