## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting the version information to be fetched using the `fish --version` command.
2. The `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the incorrect command to get the version of Fish shell. This results in the mismatch in expected and actual values.
3. The failing test is asserting the version of the Fish shell returned by the `info` function with an incorrect format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` call to execute the `fish --version` command and modify the return statement to format the version information correctly.

## Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By correcting the command to retrieve the Fish shell version and formatting the version information to match the expected output, the corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test case.
