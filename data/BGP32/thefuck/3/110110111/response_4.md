## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test case `test_info` provides `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` to mimic the version output, which is different from the expected output `'3.5.9'`. This mismatch causes the assertion error.

The particular issue associated with this bug is related to the usage of `-v` flag triggering a recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command. The fix is mentioned to be related to the `Fish.info()` function in the `fish.py` file.

## Error
The error occurs because the expected output of the `info` function returns the complete shell version output `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`.
The call to `Popen` does not match the expected command to retrieve the version, causing the function to return the incorrect information.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the command used by `Popen` to correctly fetch only the version string without additional information. Additionally, ensure the returned version string matches the expected format `'3.5.9'`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adjusting the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and then parsing the version string correctly using `split(', version ')`, we can extract only the version number. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
