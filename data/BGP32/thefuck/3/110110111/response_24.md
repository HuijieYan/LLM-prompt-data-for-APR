## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The issue arises because the expected version output from the command is `"fish, version 3.5.9"` but the function is not properly parsing this output to extract only the version number `"3.5.9"`.

## Identifying the Bug
The bug in the `info` function is evident in the failing test where the output of the command is not correctly parsed to extract the version number. The expected output is `"Fish Shell 3.5.9"` but the actual output is `"Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9"`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly parsing the version number from the command output. The function assumes the output directly provides the version number, leading to a discrepancy in the version information between expected and actual.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the version number from the command output. We should extract only the version number from the output, strip any additional information, and then format it in the desired way to include in the return statement.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version_output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
``` 

In the corrected version, we extract only the version number from the output of the command before formatting it with the shell name. This change ensures that the function returns the correct version information without additional text.
