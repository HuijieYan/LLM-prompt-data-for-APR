## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to extract the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock behavior for `Popen` to return the version string `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the buggy function is not extracting the correct version string.
3. The error message shows a mismatch between the expected version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the extracted version string `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, indicating a problem in how the version string is processed.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the function hangs due to a recursive loop caused by this issue.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix involves modifying the command that is used to extract the version information to capture just the version number without any additional metadata. This can be done by using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the correct version string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function in the Fish class

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this fix, the `info` function will correctly extract the Fish shell version using `fish --version` command, and the test case `test_info` should pass without any assertion errors.
