## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the expected version is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' which is not in alignment with the output of the shell command.
2. The failing test sets the side effect of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, which indicates that the shell command output should be 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This mismatches the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
3. The error message shows that the actual output of the buggy function is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', indicating that the function is not correctly parsing the version from the command output.
4. The incorrect command is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, leading to parsing issues and incorrect output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to 'fish --version' to align with the expected test output.
2. Modify the parsing of the command output to correctly extract the version information.
3. Return the correct format of 'Fish Shell <version>'.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # correct parsing here
        version = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()  # extract version part correctly
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # return the correct format
```

By making these modifications, the corrected `info` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
