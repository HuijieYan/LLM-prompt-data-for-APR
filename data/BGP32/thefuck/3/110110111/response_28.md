## Analysis
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `info` is a method of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file under the `shells` module.
  
2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug seems to be in the way the version string is extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The current implementation of the `info` function does not handle the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly. This leads to an incorrect version string being returned and fails the test case.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the way the version string is extracted from the output of the command to ensure the correct version is obtained.

## Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2].strip(',')
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version:
- We run the `fish --version` command instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
- We split the output by spaces and extract the relevant version number from the 3rd element.
- The version is then formatted correctly in the return statement using an f-string.

This corrected version should now correctly extract the version number and pass the failing test case.
