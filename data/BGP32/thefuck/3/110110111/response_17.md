## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info` inside the `Fish` class. It is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, it currently reads the output incorrectly, leading to an incorrect version output in the return statement.
   
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the lines where it fetches the version output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

3. The bug is caused by incorrectly reading the version output from the process and not handling the correct format of the version string. The failing test expects the version to be correctly formatted as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current function returns the version with extra characters, leading to the assertion error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct how the version output is read and formatted in the `info` function. We must ensure that only the version number is extracted from the command output and formatted properly before returning it.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version output correctly and formatting it with the shell name, this corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
