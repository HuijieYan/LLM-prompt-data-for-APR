After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the command being executed in the `info` function. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not the correct command to retrieve the version of Fish shell. Instead, the correct command is `fish --version`. This discrepancy causes the function to return unexpected output, leading to the failed test.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` function call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the version information.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # Corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the function now executes the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version information, resolving the issue and allowing the function to return the expected output as per the failing test's expectations. This correction addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to the bug.
