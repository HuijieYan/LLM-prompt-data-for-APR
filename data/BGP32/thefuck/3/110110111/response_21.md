## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using `Popen`. The expected output of this command is the version number to be extracted and formatted.
   
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock response for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. It then asserts that the output of `shell.info()` should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. However, the current implementation does not correctly extract and format the version number, leading to a failing assertion.

3. The error message indicates that the actual result is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, which includes the command name 'fish'. The expected result is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, without the extraneous information.

4. To fix this bug, the version extraction logic in the `info` function needs to be adjusted to correctly process the command output and format it as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic of extracting the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to ensure it only extracts the version number and discards any additional information.

## Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(',')[1].strip().replace('version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the version extraction logic to split the output by the comma and extract the second part, isolate the version number, and then format it appropriately, we can ensure that the function correctly extracts and formats the Fish shell version.
