Based on the error message and the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, there are a couple of issues in the `info` function of the `Fish` class:
1. The command used to get the Fish shell version should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The output of the command includes the word "fish," which needs to be removed before formatting the version string.

To fix the bug, update the command to `['fish', '--version']` and remove the unnecessary "fish," from the version string before formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the `info` function should now return the correct Fish shell version without the extraneous "fish," text and pass the failing test case.
