The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`), which does not match the command used in the test case (`fish --version`). This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual version values, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to use the correct command (`fish --version`) to get the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the function should handle the process communication properly to capture the version information correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Then, the version string is properly extracted using `split(', version ')[1]` to match the expected output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
