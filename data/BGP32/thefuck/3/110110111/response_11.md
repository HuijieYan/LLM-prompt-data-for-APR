Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the test code, the error message, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug is related to the incorrect command used to obtain the Fish shell version. The current command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' does not return the proper version format that the function is expecting.

To fix this bug, we need to change the command used to get the version information to 'fish --version'. This command will correctly return the version information in the expected format, allowing the function to extract and format it properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using 'fish --version' command instead and properly formatting the version output, the corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
