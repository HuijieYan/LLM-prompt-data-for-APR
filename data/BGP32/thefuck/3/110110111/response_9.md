## Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell).
2. **Test Code**: The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock `Popen` object to simulate the output of the `fish --version` command.
3. **Error Message**: The assertion failure indicates that the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` does not match the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. **Expected Input/Output**: The function should extract the version number from the output of the `fish --version` command and format it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.
5. **GitHub Issue**: The issue is related to a recursive loop triggered by running `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Bug Identification
The bug is likely due to the mismatch between the expected output format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the actual output format `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. The function is not correctly parsing the version number from the command output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Update the command in `Popen` to execute `fish --version`.
- Parse the version number from the command output correctly.
- Format the output string as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()  # Extract version number correctly
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Format output string correctly
``` 

With these corrections, the function should now correctly parse the version number and return the expected output format.
