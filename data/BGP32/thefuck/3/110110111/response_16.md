### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class from the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command. The problem seems to be with how the version information is extracted and formatted.
2. The test function `test_info(self, shell, Popen)` in the `test_fish.py` file checks if the shell's version is correctly retrieved and formatted. The issue arises from incorrect formatting of the output string.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error because the expected output format does not match the actual output.
4. The bug is caused by not extracting the correct format of the version string from the command output. The `--version` flag should have been used instead of directly parsing the output.
5. To fix the bug, modify the way the version is extracted in the `info(self)` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# The correction includes using '--version' flag in Popen command and correctly parsing the version info from the output
```

By modifying the `Popen` command to use `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the version information is extracted correctly. Furthermore, we refine the version string extraction by splitting it based on ',' and ' ' to get the exact version number. This correction should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
