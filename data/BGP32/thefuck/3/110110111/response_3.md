## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This command is incorrect as it does not return the version in the desired format.
2. The failing test is setting the side effect of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to simulate the output of the command `fish, version 3.5.9\n`.
3. The failing test expects the return value of the `info` function to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it fails due to the incorrect parsing of the version string.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the command used to fetch the Fish shell version within the `info` function.
5. The corrected version of the function should properly parse the output of the command and format it as expected by the failing test.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip().split(' ')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using `fish --version` command to get the version string and then properly parsing it to extract the version number, we can address the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
