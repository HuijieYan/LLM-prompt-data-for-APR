## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` through a subprocess call. 
2. The test function `test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` checks if the version output matches the expected format.
3. The error arises from the mismatch in the actual output (`'fish, version 3.5.9'`) and the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`).

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the actual version output, including additional characters (`'fish, version '`), and the expected output format (`'Fish Shell x.y.z'`). The function does not correctly extract the version number from the subprocess output.

## Fix:
We need to modify the `info()` function to correctly extract the version number from the output of the subprocess call.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract and return the version number from the subprocess output, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
