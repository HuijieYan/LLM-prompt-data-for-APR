Based on the analysis, the issue lies in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the file `fish.py`. The function is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected version format is not obtained from the command output, resulting in the assertion error in the test case.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is not capturing the version correctly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual version strings when constructing the return value of the `info` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed by `Popen` to capture the correct version. We also need to adjust the way we extract the version from the command output to ensure it matches the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` to capture the version correctly and adjusting the `version` extraction to `split(", version ")[-1]`, we can ensure that the correct version format is obtained and returned by the `info` function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
