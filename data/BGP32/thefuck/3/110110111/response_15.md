## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell using a subprocess but not correctly parsing the output.
2. The test code is mocking the subprocess response to simulate the output, but the function is failing to handle this response.
3. The error message shows that the expected output string is not matching the actual output, indicating a parsing issue with the version string.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect parsing of the version string retrieved from the subprocess.
5. The fix involves correctly parsing and formatting the version string.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to correctly read and parse the version string from the subprocess output.
2. Modify the format of the version string to match the expected output.
3. Use appropriate decoding and splitting methods to extract the version number.
4. Update the function to handle the mocked subprocess response correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]  # Extract version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Correct format for the version
```

With the above corrected version, the function should now correctly extract and format the version number from the subprocess output, resolving the bug.
