In the provided buggy function `info()`, the main issue is that the command being executed using `Popen` is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish', '--version'`. Additionally, the decoding method on the stdout is also incorrect. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation of the bug:
- The original function was trying to retrieve the fish version using `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which is incorrect.
- The correct command to get the fish version is `'fish', '--version'.
- In the original function, the decoding method `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` was used, which caused an issue. It should be replaced with `proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()` to properly read the UTF-8 encoded output.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now work as expected and pass the failing test case.
