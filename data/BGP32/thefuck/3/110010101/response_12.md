### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, the output is not being properly decoded and formatted, leading to the assertion error.
2. The error is occurring because the `version` variable is not being decoded correctly from the output of the command.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding and formatting of the `version` variable, resulting in an unexpected output format in the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct decoding and formatting of the `version` variable before returning it in the desired format.
5. The corrected version of the `info` function is provided below:

### Corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
