### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `info`, is trying to execute a command using `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the output received is not parsed correctly, resulting in the whole output being used as the version string instead of just the version number.
2. The `Popen` and `version` variables need to be handled correctly to extract only the version number from the output of the command.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the output from `Popen` in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line reads the entire output without filtering out just the version number.
4. To fix the bug, the output of `proc.stdout.read()` should be split to extract only the version number.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(" ")[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
