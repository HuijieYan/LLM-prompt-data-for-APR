### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `info`, is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the function is not correctly extracting the version from the output.
2. The error message indicates that the expected version is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the function is returning a string that includes the output the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
3. The bug is caused by not correctly extracting the version from the command output. The function is returning the string 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version is extracted from the command output before formatting the final string.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the code to correctly read and extract the version from the command output.
2. Format the extracted version into the final string 'Fish Shell <version>'.
  
### Corrected Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
        version_str = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version_str}'
``` 

Now the corrected version of the `info` function should correctly extract the version from the command output and return 'Fish Shell <version>'.
