### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen`, reading the output, and formatting it into a string. 
2. The error message indicates that the output of the command contains extra text (`fish, version`) which is affecting the comparison.
3. The issue is that the command output includes the text `fish, version` in addition to the version number. This extra text is not handled in the function, leading to a mismatch during the comparison.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number without the additional text.
5. I will update the function to properly extract and format the version number.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split()[3]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output using spaces and extracting the fourth part (index 3), we can get the version number without the extra text. This correction should now pass the failing test case.
