### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and reading its output. However, the output is incorrect as it includes the word "fish, version" before the actual version number.
2. The `assert` statement in the failing test indicates that the expected output is missing the unnecessary "fish, version" part.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is directly returning the output with the unnecessary text instead of parsing it to extract only the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to parse the output of the command to extract only the version number before returning it.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
