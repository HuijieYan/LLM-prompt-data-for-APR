### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` with subprocess. The error arises because the version output includes unwanted text `"fish, version"` before the actual version number.
2. The bug is caused by not properly parsing the output of the subprocess to extract only the version number.
3. The `assert` statement in the failing test is checking for the complete string `"Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9"` instead of just the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to extract and format only the version number from the subprocess output.
  
### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess command. Here is the corrected version:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modification extracts only the version number from the output and returns it with the correct formatting. Now the corrected function should pass the failing test case.
