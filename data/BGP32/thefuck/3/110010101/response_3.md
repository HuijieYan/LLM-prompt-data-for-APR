## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info()` is trying to fetch the version of the current Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` and extracting the version from the output. The extracted version is then used to construct a string representing the Fish shell name and version.
   
2. The test case is mocking the behavior of `Popen` to return a specific version value when `stdout.read()` is called.

3. The bug occurs because the buggy function is interpreting the output value of `echo $FISH_VERSION` as `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the expected version `'3.5.9'`. This discrepancy causes the assertion failure.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the extraction logic to obtain only the version number from the output instead of the raw output itself.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version part
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the `version` extraction logic to `split()` the obtained output and retrieve the last part (which is the version number), we ensure that the function returns the expected version number.
