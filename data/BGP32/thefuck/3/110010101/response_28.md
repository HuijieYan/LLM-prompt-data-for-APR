### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using Popen. However, the function is not handling the output correctly, resulting in the version being displayed as `"fish, version 3.5.9"` instead of `"3.5.9"`.
2. The error is caused by not correctly parsing the output of the command executed with Popen.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is directly calling `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` without considering the actual output format of the command executed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract and process the output of the shell command.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output
        if ',' in version:
            version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number only
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
