### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info(self)` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in the shell. However, the comparison in the test is failing because the returned version string includes extra characters.
2. The bug is likely caused by not properly decoding the output from `proc.stdout.read()`.
3. The bug is causing the version string to include extra characters like `fish,`. The expected output is just the version number without any extra characters.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly decode the output from `proc.stdout.read()` to get only the version number.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace("fish, version ", "")
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding `replace("fish, version ", "")` after decoding the output, we remove the unnecessary characters and only return the version number. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
