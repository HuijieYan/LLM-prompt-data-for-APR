### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. The issue lies in the fact that the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is used instead of `'fish --version'`, which would actually return the version information.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed to obtain the Fish shell version. The function is expecting the output of `'fish --version'`, but currently trying to read the output of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` should be replaced with `'fish --version'` to correctly obtain the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
