## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the provided test case expects the version to be retrieved by the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the buggy function is using 'fish --version' instead. This discrepancy in the command is causing the test to fail.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function is running the command 'fish --version' to get the version of the Fish shell, while the test case expects the version to be retrieved by the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This mismatch in the commands is causing the test case to fail because the expected output is not obtained.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should be modified to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version' to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command in the `Popen` call from `'fish --version'` to `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, the corrected function will now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell as expected by the test case.
