## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The bug seems to be in the command used to get the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the way the output is being retrieved from the process.

## Bug Explanation
1. The command being used to get the version is incorrect (`echo $FISH_VERSION`), and it should be changed to `fish --version`.
2. The way the output is being retrieved (`proc.stdout.read()`) is not correct because `Popen` returns a byte stream and calling `read()` directly on it can result in incomplete or incorrect data being read.

## Fix Strategy
1. Update the command to get the Fish shell version to `fish --version`.
2. Instead of reading directly from `proc.stdout`, we should use `communicate()` method which is recommended for reading from process.

## Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this correction, the `info()` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test case.
