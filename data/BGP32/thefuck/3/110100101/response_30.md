### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The incorrect command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is being used instead of `'fish --version'`. This causes the version output to be incorrect, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using the wrong command to obtain the Fish shell version. The function is currently executing `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be changed from `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `'fish --version'`.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[2]  # Extract the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By updating the command to `'fish --version'` and extracting the version number correctly, the corrected function should now return the expected version and pass the failing test.
