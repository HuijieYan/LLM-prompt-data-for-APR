## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and extracting the version from the output.
2. The test is setting up the `Popen` object mock to return the version string `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `stdout.read()` is called.
3. The bug is caused by an incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version. The function is expecting the output of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to contain just the version number, but the actual output includes more information.
4. To fix the bug, the function should use `fish --version` instead of the current command to accurately retrieve the Fish shell version.

## Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the version from the output of `fish --version` and return the expected result `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
