### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is attempting to get the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`, which is not being executed in the current implementation. Additionally, the way the version is being read from the subprocess output may not be compatible with the test expectations.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and the way the version is read from the subprocess output. The test expects the version to be retrieved using `fish --version` but the function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Furthermore, the method of reading the stdout and decoding it may not match with the test's expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the command executed by the subprocess to `['fish', '--version']` to match the test expectations.
2. Update the method of reading the version from the subprocess output to ensure it aligns with the expected format.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
