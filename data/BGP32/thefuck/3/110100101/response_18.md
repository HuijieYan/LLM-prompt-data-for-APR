### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell running.
2. The function is using `Popen` to run a command to get the Fish shell version but is not using the correct command. The expected command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. The failing test is asserting the output of the function and the call arguments of `Popen`. It fails because the function is not returning the correct version and not using the correct command to get the version.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed with `Popen` to get the Fish shell version correctly.

### Bug Fix
```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function should now correctly obtain the Fish shell version and pass the failing test case.
