## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. The bug seems to be related to the command used to get the version and how the version is extracted from the output.

## Bug
The bug lies in the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being used to get the Fish shell version. This command might not return the correct version string, leading to an incorrect result.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the command should be changed to `fish --version` which will reliably return the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the method of reading the output using `proc.stdout.read()` should be corrected to use `communicate()` method instead.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
