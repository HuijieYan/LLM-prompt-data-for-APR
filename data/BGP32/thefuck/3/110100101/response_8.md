## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the command used to retrieve the version is incorrect, causing the function to fail the test.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not return the actual version of Fish shell. Furthermore, the test case `Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']` expects the command `['fish', '--version']` to be called, which is not reflected in the buggy function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to `['fish', '--version']`. This change will ensure that the correct command is executed to retrieve the version, satisfying the expectations of the test case.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version, passing the failing test.
