### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is retrieving the version of the fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting the version to be extracted from the command `fish --version`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the fish shell. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, it should use `fish --version` to match the expectations of the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call to `fish --version`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
