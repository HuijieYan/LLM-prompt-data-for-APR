## Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by calling `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess and capturing the output.
- The test function is mocking the subprocess output as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
- The `Popen` call in the buggy function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`.
- The function is reading the output from the subprocess `stdout` using `proc.stdout.read()`, which might cause issues in the decoding process.

## Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the fact that the `Popen` command in the `info` function does not match the expected command in the test case. Additionally, `proc.stdout.read()` might cause problems when trying to decode the output.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the `Popen` command to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected command in the test case.
2. Use `communicate()` method on the `proc` object to read the output in a more reliable way.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly fetch and return the version of the Fish shell, as well as pass the failing test case.
