The buggy function `info()` is not correctly reading the shell version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function is currently expecting the output to be in the format `'version x.x.x'`, but the actual output is `'fish, version x.x.x'`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the parsing logic to extract only the version number from the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the version number from the command output and return it as expected.

This correction will now allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
