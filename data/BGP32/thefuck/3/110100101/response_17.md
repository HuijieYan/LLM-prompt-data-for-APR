## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command, but the command used does not match the expected output check in the test function. The test function expects the version information to be obtained using `fish --version`, but the buggy function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command (`fish --version`) in the test function. This results in the wrong version information being retrieved and failing the test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the command in the `info` function should be changed to `fish --version` to match the expected command in the test function. This change will ensure that the correct version information is retrieved.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the `info` function will now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using `fish --version`, satisfying the expected output in the test function.
