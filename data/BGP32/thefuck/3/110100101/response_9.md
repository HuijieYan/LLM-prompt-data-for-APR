### Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output from the process.
- The test case is mocking the output of the command as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` but the function is trying to extract the version number from the output using the wrong command.
- The expected command to get the version of Fish shell is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, not `fish --version`.

### Bug
The bug is in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function is using the incorrect command `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Fix
Fix the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` in the `info` function.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
