Based on the runtime and expected values provided, it seems that the issue lies in the way the version string is extracted from the output of the subprocess. The version extracted includes unnecessary text like "fish, version" which should be removed.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the extraction of the version string by removing the unnecessary text. We can do this by splitting the version string based on space and keeping only the version number part.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version will properly extract only the version number from the output, resulting in the correct version string "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This fix should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub and provide the expected output for the function.
