## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by executing a subprocess with the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the current implementation is not handling the subprocess output correctly.
2. The subprocess `Popen` is used to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the reading of the stdout is not handled properly causing incorrect parsing of the version.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when running `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop. This behavior is likely caused by the incorrect output parsing within the `info` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is properly read and decoded to extract the version information accurately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the way the subprocess output is read and decoded to capture the version information correctly.
2. Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution and output parsing.

## Bug-Free Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function after fixing the bug
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Unknown Fish Shell Version"
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` to capture the output of the subprocess, we ensure that the decoding and parsing of the version information are done correctly. Additionally, we catch any exceptions that might occur during the subprocess execution to provide a fallback message in case of errors.
