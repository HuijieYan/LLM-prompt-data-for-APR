### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically for Fish shell.
2. The function uses the `Popen` module to execute a command in the shell and capture the output.
3. The issue arises due to the way the output is being processed and formatted from the executed command.
4. The expected output should be the version number of the Fish shell.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that the current implementation causes a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command execution process to properly capture the version number of the Fish shell.
2. Ensure that the output is formatted correctly to only display the version number without any additional information.
3. Address the recursive loop issue by handling the command execution in a way that does not cause conflicts with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version.split()[-1]
``` 

This corrected version directly retrieves the version number of the Fish shell without any additional information. It should address the issue of improper output formatting and resolve the recursive loop problem when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
