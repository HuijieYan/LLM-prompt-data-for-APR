## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the way it is reading the output from the process is causing issues.
2. The `proc.stdout.read()` is returning a `MagicMock` object instead of the actual output string from the command.
3. This bug is causing the function to return an incorrect string representation of the Fish Shell version.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify how we retrieve the output from the process and ensure that we only extract the version information from it.

## Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version number
        version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In this fix, after decoding the output from the process, we split the string by commas and take the last part, which contains the version number without extra information. This ensures that we only get the version number and can return it as expected.
