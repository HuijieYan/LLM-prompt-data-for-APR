To fix the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file, we can modify the function to correctly extract the version information from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

The main issue in the buggy function lies in how it reads the output from the `Popen` process. The current implementation uses `proc.stdout.read()` which may not retrieve the output correctly. Instead, we should use `proc.communicate()[0]` to correctly capture the output of the command.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction ensures that the function reads the output of the command correctly, extracts the version information, and formats it appropriately. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to the 'thefuck' plugin causing hangs during Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
