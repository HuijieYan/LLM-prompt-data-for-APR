First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the issue on GitHub. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish Shell in this case. The issue on GitHub titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" indicates that the problem arises from using the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables in Case 1, it seems that the `proc` variable is being set up correctly using `Popen` but the extraction of the `version` from `stdout` is not structured accurately, resulting in the version being 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'. This discrepancy is likely causing issues as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, we now correctly extract and return only the version number without the additional 'fish, version ' prefix. This should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub and align the function's behavior with the expected output values.
