The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the output from the Popen subprocess. The function is attempting to read the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to finish, leading to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the function is expecting the version string to be in the format `'fish, version x.x.x'`, but it should only extract the version number without any additional text.

To fix the bug, the function should wait for the subprocess to finish and then properly extract the version number without any additional text.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected version will properly wait for the subprocess to finish and extract only the version number from the output without any additional text. It should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to recursive loop triggering.
