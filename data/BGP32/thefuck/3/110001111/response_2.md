### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The output of this command is then used to form a string representing the Fish shell version.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that using the `-v` flag with `thefuck` triggers a recursive loop due to the behavior of the `Fish.info` method.
3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect parsing of the version string from the subprocess output. The function is not handling the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` correctly, leading to issues with the version string.
4. To fix the bug, the function should properly extract and format the version information retrieved from the subprocess output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the method of retrieving the Fish shell version to ensure accurate extraction.
2. Update the formatting of the version string to match the expected output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the subprocess on spaces and extracting the last element, we can obtain the version number only, fixing the bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class.
