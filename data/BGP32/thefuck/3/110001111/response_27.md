After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the issue with the `Fish.info()` function lies in how it retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The current implementation is causing a recursive loop when trying to retrieve the shell version with `thefuck -v`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to properly extract the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop. One approach could be to directly read the Fish version from the `fish` function itself without invoking `thefuck -v`.

Here is the corrected version of the `Fish.info()` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function now directly runs `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and provide the correct version of the Fish shell.
