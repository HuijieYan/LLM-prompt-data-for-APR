## Fixing the bug

### Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be in how the `Popen` process is handled and the decoding of the output. Specifically, the issue might be related to capturing the stdout from the `Popen` process and decoding it properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `Fish.info()` function in the `fish.py` file does not handle the output from the `Popen` process correctly. It fails to properly decode the shell version information obtained from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, resulting in an incorrect shell version being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the output from the `Popen` process is correctly captured in the `version` variable.
2. Decode the byte output obtained from `proc.stdout.read()` properly to get the accurate shell version.
3. Trim any unnecessary characters from the output to only extract the version number.
4. Update the return statement to format the shell version correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()  # Get byte output
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()  # Decode the byte output and remove whitespace

        # Extract only the version number from the output string
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip() if ',' in version else version

        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
1. The output from `proc.stdout.read()` is stored in `version_bytes`.
2. The `version_bytes` are correctly decoded to a string and leading/trailing whitespace is removed.
3. The version number is extracted from the string by splitting on ',' and getting the second part (if exists).
4. The return statement formats the shell version correctly with the extracted version number.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly extract and return the shell version information as intended.
