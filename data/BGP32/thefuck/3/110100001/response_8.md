## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` with the arguments `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. The test case provided is mocking the output of the process to simulate the version being 'fish, version 3.5.9\n'.
3. The bug in the current implementation is that the command used to get the version is incorrect (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `--version`), leading to incorrect reading of the version.
4. To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` needs to be corrected to `['fish', '--version']`.

## Correction:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]  # Extracting the version substring
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By correcting the command passed to `Popen` and extracting the version from the output, the updated `info` function should now return the correct shell version as expected.
