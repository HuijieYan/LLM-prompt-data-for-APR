The buggy function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the test function is expecting the command `fish --version` to be executed.

The bug is caused by the mismatch in the command being executed in the subprocess and the expected command in the test function.

To fix this bug, we need to change the command being passed to the subprocess to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now run the correct command in the subprocess, and the test should pass successfully.
