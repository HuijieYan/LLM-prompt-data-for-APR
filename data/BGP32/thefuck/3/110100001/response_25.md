### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. It expects the version output in the format `fish, version x.y.z`.
2. The test function `test_info` sets up the mock behavior for `Popen` to return a specific version output when called with `stdout.read`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` in the `Popen` call does not match the expected output format (`fish, version x.y.z`).
4. To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to retrieve the version in the correct format and match the expected output set in the test function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the `Popen` call will fetch the version string in the correct format. Then, by extracting the version number from the output using `split(' ')[2]`, we can get the version number to match the expected format in the test function.

This fix ensures that the `info` function correctly retrieves the Fish shell version and passes the failing test.
