### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by invoking a subprocess using `Popen`.
2. In the test function `test_info`, the expected version string to be returned is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The test is failing because the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` in the `info` function is fetching the wrong output and not matching the expected version string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version. Instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the correct command should be `fish --version` to retrieve the version information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` with `['fish', '--version']` in the `info` function to obtain the correct version string.
2. Verify the output and strip any unnecessary characters to match the expected version string in the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1].strip())

# The corrected version of the info function now correctly fetches the Fish shell version
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the `info` function will now use the correct command to obtain the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
