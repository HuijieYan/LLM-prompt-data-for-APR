The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. 

The issue in the buggy function lies in the call to `Popen` where the command specified is incorrect (`['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`) and the expected output is not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command to `['fish', '--version']` and modify the reading and decoding of the output from the process to extract the version correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version.split()[-1]}'
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should be able to successfully retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
