## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell.
2. The function uses `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the Fish version.
3. The failing test sets up a mock scenario where `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` is used to simulate the output of the command being executed.
4. The failing test checks if the version returned by `shell.info()` matches the expected version and also verifies the command passed to `Popen`.

## Identifying the Issue:
1. The command passed to `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the failing test expects it to be `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The failing test sets up the mock scenario for the wrong command, which leads to the test failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the command passed to `Popen` in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expectations of the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the corrected function will return the correct version of the Fish shell, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
