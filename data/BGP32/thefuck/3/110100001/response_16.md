There are a couple of issues with the buggy function:

1. The command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be extracted using the command `fish --version`.
2. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` method is not providing the expected output for the test.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the shell version command to `fish --version` and updating the parsing of the output to correctly extract the version as expected by the test, the function should now pass the failing test.
