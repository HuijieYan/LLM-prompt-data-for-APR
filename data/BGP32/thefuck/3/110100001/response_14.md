## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version number of the Fish shell. It uses a subprocess to call `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and extract the version from the output.
2. The test is mocking the `Popen` class and specifying that it should return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is trying to extract the version in a different way, leading to a failure.
3. The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected output in the test (`fish, version 3.5.9\n`).
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the command in the `Popen` call to retrieve the version number in a format that matches the expected output in the test.
5. We can modify the command to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected output and fix the bug.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
