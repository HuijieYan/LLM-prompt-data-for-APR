### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish shell. However, the bug arises from the incorrect command used to get the version of the Fish shell.

### Bug:
The bug in the `info` function is that it uses `echo $FISH_VERSION` as the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the test function is expecting the command `fish --version` to be used.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` in order to correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this correction, the `info` function now correctly retrieves the version of the Fish shell using the `fish --version` command, which will pass the failing test.
