### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
2. The test function checks if the correct version is extracted from the command output.
3. The bug seems to be in the command passed to `Popen` and the way the output is being read.
4. The cause of the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is different from what the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the way the output is read from `proc.stdout` is incorrect.
5. To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be `['fish', '--version']` and the output should be read using `communicate()` method instead of `read()`.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Use `communicate()` method to get the output from the process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command passed to `Popen` and correctly reading the output using `communicate()`, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
