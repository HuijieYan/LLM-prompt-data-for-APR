## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
2. The command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not directly provide the version number of the Fish shell.
3. The failing test is expecting the function to retrieve the version using the `--version` flag with the `fish` command, which is not currently implemented.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed in the `info` function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function needs to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the correct version info.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed in the `Popen` function to `fish --version` to get the correct version information.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this fix, the `info` function in the `Fish` class will correctly execute the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
