## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info(self)` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell.
2. The test function `test_info` mocks the `Popen` function and sets it to return the output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when called.
3. The bug appears to be in the way the command and arguments are structured for the `Popen` call and reading the output from the `Popen` process.
4. The bug causes the `info` function to use the incorrect command and fail to properly parse the version from the output.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) being used in the `Popen` call, which does not provide the version directly. Additionally, the way the output is read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not parsing the version correctly.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to `'fish', '--version'` to retrieve the version.
2. Correctly read and parse the version from the output of the `Popen` process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version from the output
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

With the corrected version of the function, it should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version using the `'fish', '--version'` command and parse the version from the output.
