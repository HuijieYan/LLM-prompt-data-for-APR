## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing the output.
2. The bug is likely due to the command used in `Popen` not matching the expected output in the test function.
3. The failing test expects the version information to be retrieved with the command `['fish', '--version']` but the function is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This mismatch is causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected output in the test.
5. The corrected version of the function is shown below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
