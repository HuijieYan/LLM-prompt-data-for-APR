### Analysis:

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The bug occurs in the `proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` line and the subsequent processing of the output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command passed to `Popen` may not be correctly capturing the Fish shell version.
2. Reading the output from `proc.stdout.read()` may not be handling the correct format of the version string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation is that the command passed to `Popen` is using `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is looking for `['fish', '--version']` in the call arguments. This mismatch is causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command passed to `Popen` to `'fish', '--version'` to match the expected output in the test.
2. Update the processing of the output to correctly extract the version string from the output.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function now correctly executes the `fish --version` command to capture the version string and extract the version number from the output. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
