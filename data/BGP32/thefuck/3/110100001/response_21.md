## Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess command to get the version number of Fish shell. The bug seems to be related to the subprocess command used to fetch the version number.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info()` function is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version number of Fish shell, but in the failing test, the expected output is retrieved using the command `fish --version`. This mismatch in the command being executed causes the function to fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch between the command used in the buggy function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command in the failing test (`fish --version`). The function is not fetching the correct version number due to this discrepancy.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the subprocess command in the `info()` function to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to correctly fetch the version number of Fish shell.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the info() function in the Fish class

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this correction, the `info()` function should now correctly fetch the version number of Fish shell using the `fish --version` command and pass the failing test.
