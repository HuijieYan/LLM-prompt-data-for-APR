## Buggy Function Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell).
2. The function uses `Popen` to run a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell.
3. The expected version output is captured from `proc.stdout.read()` and formatted as `Fish Shell <version>`.

## Identified Errors:
1. The command being executed in the `Popen` call is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the failing test, the expected command is `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The expected version output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` in the failing test does not match the output captured by the `info` function.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `info` function is due to mismatched command being executed in the `Popen` call and the mismatch in the expected version output in the failing test. The function is unable to capture the correct version of the Fish shell due to these discrepancies.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command being executed in `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected command in the failing test.
2. Parse the correct version output to correctly capture the version of the Fish shell.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell (Fish)"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By fixing the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` and parsing the correct version output from the shell, the corrected version of the `info` function should pass the failing test successfully.
