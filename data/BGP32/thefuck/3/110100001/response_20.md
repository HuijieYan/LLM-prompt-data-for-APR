## Analysis:

1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to run a command in the Fish shell and extract the version.
   
2. The bug in the existing function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test case expects the command to be `'fish', '--version'`. This mismatch is causing the test to fail.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not executing the correct command (`'fish', '--version'`) to retrieve the Fish shell version. This discrepancy results in the `assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']` failing in the test.

4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the command executed by `Popen` in the `info` function to be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

## Proposed Fix:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, the `info` function now correctly retrieves the version of the Fish shell as expected by the test case. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
