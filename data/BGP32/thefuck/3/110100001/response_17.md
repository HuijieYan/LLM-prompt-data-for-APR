## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. 
2. The test function is setting up the mock behavior for `Popen` to return the version information of Fish shell, but the command being executed in the function is different from what the test expects.
3. The bug is caused because the command used in `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` whereas the test expects `['fish', '--version']`.
4. One strategy to fix the bug is to change the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` so that it matches the expected command in the test.

## Correction:
```python
# Updated corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, the corrected version of the function now matches the expected command from the test function.
