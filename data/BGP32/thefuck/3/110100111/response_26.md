## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the implementation seems to have some issues with reading the version correctly. The `test_info` function expects the version number '3.5.9' to be returned, but the current implementation reads the version from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not correct. Additionally, the test case expects the call to `Popen` to be `['fish', '--version']`, which is different from the actual call `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

## Identifying Potential Errors

- The command used in `Popen` is not correctly retrieving the version number of the Fish shell.
- The expected version number is not being extracted correctly from the output.
- The expected call to `Popen` is different from the actual call made.

## Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect command used to get the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. Additionally, the way the version is extracted and the mismatch in the expected `Popen` call further contribute to the failure in the test case.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in `Popen` to correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell. Then, we should modify the way we extract the version and ensure that the expected `Popen` call matches the actual one.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the `Popen` command to get the shell version correctly. We have also modified how we strip the version from the output to match the expected format.
