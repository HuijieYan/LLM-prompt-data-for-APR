## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is attempting to retrieve the Fish Shell version by running a subprocess command. However, it is reading the output incorrectly and not handling the expected version string properly.
2. The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. It then attempts to read the output from `proc.stdout`, which is causing the issue.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the `info` function not correctly reading and decoding the output from the subprocess. The failing test provides a version string like `fish, version 3.5.9`, but the `info` function does not handle this format and fails to extract just the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function reads and processes the output to extract and return only the version number.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `info` function below.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string and extracting just the version number, the corrected version of the `info` function should now be able to correctly return the Fish Shell version as expected by the failing test.
