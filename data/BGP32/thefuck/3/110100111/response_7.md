## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of the Fish shell using a command `[fish, '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. However, in the failing test, it expects the version to be obtained using the command `['fish', '--version']`, causing a discrepancy.
2. The test sets up a scenario where the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` method should return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n` which represents the output of the `fish --version` command.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not executing the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, leading to a mismatch in the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to execute the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the version information of the Fish shell.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the command to `['fish', '--version']` in the `info` function of the `Fish` class, the bug will be fixed, and the function will return the correct version of the Fish shell as expected by the failing test.
