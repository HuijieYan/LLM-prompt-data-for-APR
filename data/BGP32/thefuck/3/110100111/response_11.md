### Analysis:
1. The buggy function named `info` is part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file within `thefuck` project.
2. The function is responsible for returning the name and version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess with the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
3. The failing test checks if the returned version matches the expected version and if the `Popen` subprocess is called with the correct arguments.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to this function.

### Error locations:
1. The command being executed in the subprocess seems to be incorrect (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not match what the test expects).
2. The reading of stdout from the subprocess might not be handled correctly causing incorrect decoding and stripping of the version.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the discrepancy in the subprocess command being executed (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` vs. `fish --version`) and possible mishandling of stdout reading. This leads to the function returning an unexpected version and failing the test.

### Bug-fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the subprocess command should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`, and the stdout reading should be properly handled to extract the version correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the subprocess command to `'fish --version'` and correctly reading the version from the output, the function should now return the expected version and pass the failing test.
