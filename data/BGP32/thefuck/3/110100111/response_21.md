### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, Fish shell.
2. The function is using `Popen` to run a command to retrieve the Fish shell version, but it's not using the correct command to get the version.
3. The test is mocking the response of the command `fish --version`, but the function is trying to get the version with `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
4. The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect version of the Fish shell.
5. To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed to retrieve the version correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function is expecting the version to be obtained by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is mocking the response of `fish --version`. This mismatch causes the function to return the wrong version in comparison to the expected result.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to align it with the test's expectations.
2. Modify the command so that it retrieves the Fish shell version correctly by executing `fish --version`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# The corrected test function
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

After applying the corrected version, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `fish --version` and pass the failing test.
