### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to extract the version of Fish Shell using a subprocess call, but the command being used is incorrect, leading to incorrect output and causing the test to fail.
2. The subprocess command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` should be modified to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly extract the version.
3. The `test_info` test case expects the correct version number to be extracted when calling the `info` function, but due to the incorrect subprocess command, the function returns an incorrect version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the subprocess command to fetch the Fish Shell version correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect subprocess command used to extract the Fish Shell version. The function expects to read the version from the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should actually be reading the version from the output of `fish --version`.

### Bug Fix:
I will update the subprocess command in the `info` function to properly fetch the Fish Shell version using `fish --version`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_info.split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Now, the `info` function in the `Fish` class will correctly extract the Fish Shell version using `fish --version`, fixing the bug.
