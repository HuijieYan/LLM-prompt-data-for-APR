### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the Fish class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell.
2. The bug occurs due to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version.
3. The test case `test_info` of the Fish shell fails as it expects the version to be fetched by running `fish --version`, but the buggy function uses a different command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the command used in the `Popen` call inside the `info` function is different from what the test case expects. The test case sets up the return value for `stdout.read` assuming the command `fish --version` will be executed, but the actual command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, update the command in the `Popen` call to fetch the Fish shell version using `['fish', '--version']`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will now correctly fetch the Fish shell version as expected by the test case, resolving the bug.
