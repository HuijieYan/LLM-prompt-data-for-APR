### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command in the terminal.
2. The function uses `Popen` from `subprocess` to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and fetch the version information.
3. The failing test case mocks the `Popen` object to return the version string but expects it to call `fish --version`, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual input/output values.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the current implementation causes a recursive loop due to incorrect command usage.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the expected command (`fish --version`) and the actual command (`fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) being run inside the `info` function. This leads to the incorrect version string being read and returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to run the correct command (`fish --version`) and parse the output accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function will correctly fetch the version information using `fish --version` and return the expected output. This fix aligns with the input/output values expected during the failing test case and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
