## Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The `info` function within the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to fetch the version, which is not the correct command to retrieve the version.
   
2. The test case `test_info` sets up a scenario where `Popen` is expected to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. However, the function reads the output incorrectly and does not capture the correct version number. The expected version is `'3.5.9'`.

3. The GitHub issue indicates that the current implementation of `Fish.info()` causes a recursive loop when utilizing the `-v` flag, leading to a hang due to incorrect version retrieval.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Update the command within the `Popen` call to correctly fetch the Fish Shell version.
2. Modify the assertion in the test case to compare the extracted version correctly.
3. Ensure that the function reads the output from `Popen` in a way that correctly captures the version number.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The command `'fish', '--version'` is used to correctly retrieve the version.
- The version string is parsed from the output to fulfill the expected value.
- The function now properly returns the name and version of Fish Shell.
