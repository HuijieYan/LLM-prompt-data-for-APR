### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess to execute a command in the Fish shell. The failing test expects the version string to be extracted from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

The current implementation of the `info` function is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version directly using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is causing the bug. Additionally, the test is setting the expected output differently than what the function is trying to extract.

### Error Location
1. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not correct for getting the Fish shell version.
2. The expected output in the test does not match the logic inside the function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version in the buggy function. As a result, the function is unable to extract the correct version from the command output, leading to the test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to a correct one, and align the expected output in the test with the corrected logic inside the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will run a subprocess with the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to get the Fish shell version. This updated version aligns with the expected output in the failing test.

This corrected version should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
