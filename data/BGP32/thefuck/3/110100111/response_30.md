## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is designed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, it is using the incorrect command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to obtain the version.
2. The test case expects the output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but due to the incorrect command usage, the test fails.
3. The bug causes the function to return a version different from what is expected in the test case.
4. To fix the bug, the function should execute the correct command (`fish --version`) to retrieve the shell version.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and parsing the output to extract the version number, the bug in the `info` function is fixed. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
