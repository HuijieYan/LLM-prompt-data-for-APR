Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using Popen process. However, it incorrectly reads the version from the process stdout, which leads to incorrect output.
2. The code is not correctly reading the version from the process stdout due to the use of `proc.stdout.read()` which does not handle the output as expected.
3. The failing test case expects the version to be '3.5.9' but due to the incorrect reading of stdout, the actual output is incorrect.
4. The bug can be fixed by using `communicate()` method of the Popen object to correctly read the output from the process stdout.

### Suggested Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Replace `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `proc.communicate()[0]` to correctly read the stdout output.
2. Ensure the returned version matches the expected format 'Fish Shell X.X.X'.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode().strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The corrected version makes use of `communicate()` to correctly read the output of the command and formats the version before returning it. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
