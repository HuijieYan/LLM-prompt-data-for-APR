### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` of the `Fish` class in `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` and then reading the output.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up the mocked `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `['fish', '--version']` is executed.
3. The bug occurs because the command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This discrepancy causes the function to retrieve an incorrect version string.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) being used to fetch the Fish shell version in the `info` function. This leads to the function returning an incorrect version string.

### Bug Fix:
We need to update the command passed to `Popen` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version using `fish --version`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making these changes, the `info` function should correctly fetch the Fish shell version using `fish --version` and return the expected output.
