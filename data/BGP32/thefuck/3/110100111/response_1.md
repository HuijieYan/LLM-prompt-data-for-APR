## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file.
2. The function uses `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version and then tries to format it into a string.
3. The bug is related to incorrect handling of the command output and formatting of the version string. The failing test input provides the version in a different format than expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the version is extracted from the command output and format it accordingly.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect assumption about the format of the version output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function expects to receive only the version number, but the output also contains other information (like "fish, version" prefix). This causes the expect assertion to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function processes the output from the command to extract just the version number. We can then format it into the expected string format.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract the version number from the output
        version = output.split(' ')[-1].strip()
        
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly extract the version number from the output of the command, leading to successful testing and meeting the expected input/output values. The fix ensures that the version number is extracted correctly and formatted into the expected string format.
