## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class calls `Popen` to execute a command and retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. The test function specifies the expected output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the command used to fetch the version is `['fish', '--version']`.
3. The bug causes the test to fail due to incorrect handling of the command and extraction of the version in the `info()` function.
4. To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` must be corrected to `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to match the extraction performed in the buggy function.

## Bug Description
The bug in the `info()` function of the `Fish` class arises from the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The faulty implementation uses `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` as specified in the failing test. This results in the extraction of the version information being incorrect, leading to test failures.

To resolve the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be updated to correctly get the Fish shell version from the environment variable.

## Updated Code
Below is the corrected version of the `info()` function in the `Fish` class.

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly retrieves the Fish shell version using the expected command, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
