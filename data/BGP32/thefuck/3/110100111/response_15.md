## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) in the Fish shell.
2. The main issue lies in the command being executed in `Popen`, as it is trying to fetch the shell version directly instead of using `--version` option which is expected in the test.
3. Since the test is expecting the version to be fetched with `--version`, the function fails to return the correct version, causing the test to fail.
4. The fix involves updating the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected behavior of the test.

## Correction
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now fetch the shell version correctly, enabling it to pass the failing test.
