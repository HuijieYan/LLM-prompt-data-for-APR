## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
- The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell.
- The bug seems to be at the line where the version of the shell is being extracted from the output of the `fish` command.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug is related to the way the expected version string is being extracted from the output of the `fish` command.

### Explanation:
- The current method for extracting the version from the output of the `fish` command is incorrect, leading to incorrect version extraction and assertion failure in the test case.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic for extracting the version from the output of the `fish` command to ensure the correct version string is obtained.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract the version correctly
        version = version.split(' ')[-1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

After making this correction, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version from the output of the `fish` command, fulfilling the expected output in the test case.

This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the test case `test_info` passes as expected.
