## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is reading the Fish version from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the `fish --version` command. This discrepancy in command execution is causing the test to fail.

## Error
The error lies in the fact that the command being executed by `Popen` in the `info()` function is not the same as the command expected by the test.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used to retrieve the Fish version in the `info()` function and the command expected by the test case. The function outputs the version but doesn't match the actual command output expected by the test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command executed in `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to match the command expected by the test.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish version, matching the expectation of the test case provided.
