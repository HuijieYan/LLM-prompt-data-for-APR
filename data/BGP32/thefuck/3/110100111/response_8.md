## Analysis
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
- The failing test case is trying to match the version extracted with the expected version `3.5.9`.
- The `Popen` call in the function is using `fish` and `-c` flags which may not be the correct command to get the Fish shell version.
- The failing test checks for the call to `Popen` with `['fish', '--version']`, which is different from what the function is currently executing.

## Bug Cause
- The bug arises because the function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the Fish shell version, which does not return the correct version string.
- The failing test expects the version to be extracted using `['fish', '--version']`, which is not the command executed by the buggy function.

## Fix Strategy
- Change the command executed by `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
- Modify the function to read the output correctly based on the changed command.
- Ensure that the function returns the version string as expected by the failing test.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command executed by `Popen` is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the correct Fish shell version. The function now correctly reads the output of `Popen` and returns the version string as expected by the failing test.
