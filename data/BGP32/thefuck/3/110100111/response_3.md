### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to fetch the Fish shell version, but in the failing test, the expected version output is `3.5.9` which is not compatible with the command used.
2. The failing test expects the command `['fish', '--version']` to be executed, but the current implementation uses `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. This discrepancy between the expected version output and the actual command to fetch the version is causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to execute the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Modify the command executed by `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the correct version of the Fish shell.
2. Update the decoding step to get the version information correctly.
3. Make sure to strip any whitespaces or newline characters from the version string before formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Get the last element which is the version
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Now, with this corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class, it should pass the failing test and provide the expected version of the Fish shell.
