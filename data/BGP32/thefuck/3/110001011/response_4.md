### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is related to the way the `Popen` process is being handled. The issue seems to be caused by not properly handling the subprocess to get the version of Fish shell. This leads to a potential hang when trying to get the version information.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess created by `Popen` is handled correctly by waiting for the process to finish before reading its output. This will prevent any potential hanging or incorrect output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        
        # Wait for the process to finish
        proc.wait()
        
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` after starting the subprocess with `Popen`, we ensure that the process is completed before trying to read its output. This correction should prevent any hanging issues related to fetching the version of the Fish shell, as reported in the GitHub issue.
