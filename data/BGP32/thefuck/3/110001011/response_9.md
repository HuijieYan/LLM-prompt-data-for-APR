### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is expected to return the name and version of the current shell, Fish shell.
2. The function uses `Popen` to run a command (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) in the Fish shell and retrieve the version information.
3. The bug seems to be related to hanging initialization when using the `-v` flag, causing a recursive loop issue as reported in the GitHub problem. This likely occurs because the command being run triggers an undesired behavior in the plugin.
4. The current implementation does not handle potential errors or unexpected behavior from the `Popen` call, leading to the hanging issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the `Popen` call is used without error handling. When the `-v` flag is used, it triggers an unintended behavior in the plugin, possibly due to the way version information is being retrieved.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add error handling to the `Popen` call to prevent hanging and handle unexpected behavior gracefully.
2. Consider checking for the `-v` flag and adjusting the behavior accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error occurred during shell info retrieval:", e)
            return "Fish Shell (version retrieval error)"
```

In the corrected version, error handling using a `try-except` block is added around the `Popen` call to catch any exceptions that may occur during the version retrieval process. If an error occurs, a generic error message is returned. This should help prevent hanging and provide more robust behavior when encountering unexpected situations.
