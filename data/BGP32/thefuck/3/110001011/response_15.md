### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, there seems to be a problem with reading the output of the subprocess and formatting the version string.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is being called to read the output, but it seems to be returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the subprocess.
2. The `version` variable is hardcoded with a value of `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of dynamically extracting the version from the output of the subprocess.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the subprocess output, leading to a wrong version being displayed. This can cause unexpected behavior or in this case, trigger recursive loops as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the subprocess is correctly read and the version is dynamically extracted. We can use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess `Popen` to read the output and decode it properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()`, we ensure that the output is read correctly. Then, decoding the output and stripping any unnecessary characters will give us the correct version of the Fish shell. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
