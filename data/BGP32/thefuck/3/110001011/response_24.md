### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. It executes a subprocess to run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell. However, the issue arises when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a recursive loop due to `info()` function calling the same shell indefinitely.

### Error Location
The error occurs in the `info()` function when trying to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess. The subprocess execution is blocking, causing the shell initialization to hang.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `Popen` subprocess execution being synchronous and blocking, which results in the hanging of the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The recursive loop happens due to the nature of the subprocess call triggering the same shell behavior repeatedly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the subprocess execution asynchronous or non-blocking. This can be achieved by using the `subprocess.run()` function with `asyncio` to handle the subprocess call in a non-blocking manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
import asyncio
from subprocess import run

class Fish(Generic):
    
    async def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell('echo $FISH_VERSION', stdout=PIPE)
        version = (await process.stdout.read()).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function is now asynchronous using `async def` to make the subprocess call non-blocking.
- `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell()` is used to create an asynchronous subprocess.
- The output of the subprocess is gathered using `await process.stdout.read()`.

This corrected version should resolve the hanging issue and prevent the recursive loop when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with the `thefuck -v` command.
