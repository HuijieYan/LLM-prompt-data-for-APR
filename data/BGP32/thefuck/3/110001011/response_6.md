### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it reads the output of the `proc.stdout` using `proc.stdout.read()` without checking if the process has completed or waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to the function returning incorrect data or hanging the execution due to not reading any output from the process.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the function to read from the process stdout before it has completed, potentially leading to incomplete or missing output. This behavior is triggered when the `thefuck -v` command is run, causing the function to read the version of Fish shell while the process is still running.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to wait for the process to finish before reading from its stdout to ensure that the full output is captured. This can be achieved by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to terminate and returns the stdout and stderr outputs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to finish and retrieve both the stdout and stderr outputs. Then, the stdout output is decoded and stripped to get the version of the Fish shell, ensuring that the function returns the correct information without hanging the execution.
