### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the usage of `stdout.read()` function without waiting for the process to finish, leading to a hanging state when trying to get the version of the Fish shell.

### Explanation:
In the provided runtime information for Case 1, the `Popen` function is used to execute the command `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, before waiting for the process to finish, the function `stdout.read()` is called immediately. This causes the process to not complete properly, leading to a hanging state and incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading the output. This can be achieved by adding `proc.wait()` before attempting to read the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish execution
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding `proc.wait()` before reading the output, the corrected version ensures that the process completes before extracting the version information, fixing the hanging state and resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
