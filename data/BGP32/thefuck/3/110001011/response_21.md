### Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that using `thefuck -v` hangs the initialization due to a recursive loop caused by this function.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Reading the output of the process before it completes execution.
2. Incorrect handling of shell version output.
3. Inadequate error handling for unexpected cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by attempting to read from `proc.stdout` before the process has completed fully, leading to a hang in some cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the process execution completes before attempting to read from `proc.stdout`.
2. Handle errors or unexpected behavior during the process execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        # Wait for the process to finish
        proc.wait()
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        if not version:
            return "Unable to determine Fish shell version"
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the process execution is waited upon before attempting to read the output. It also includes a basic error handling in case the version is empty.
