### Potential Error Locations:
1. The call to `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` may not be handling the output properly.
2. There might be a problem with the way the version information is being retrieved from the subprocess.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the version information is being extracted from the subprocess. The function may not be reading the output from the subprocess correctly, leading to incorrect version information being returned.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to handle the subprocess output properly.
2. Verify that the version information is retrieved accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    # The corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to retrieve the output of the subprocess, ensuring that the version information is obtained correctly. This should fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
