### Identified issue:
The buggy `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess with the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the subprocess does not return the expected output, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

### Explanation of the bug:
The subprocess created with `Popen` is not correctly capturing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This results in the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` call returning an unexpected value or possibly hanging, which leads to incorrect version information being returned.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the output of the subprocess is captured correctly so that the version of the Fish shell can be extracted accurately.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to read the output of the subprocess, ensuring that the version information of the Fish shell is obtained correctly. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop caused by the incorrect behavior of `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin in the Fish shell.
