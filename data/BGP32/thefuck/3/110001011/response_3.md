### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through subprocess. However, the current implementation is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.
2. The `Popen` command is used to execute a command to get the Fish shell version.
3. The cause of the bug is that when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, it triggers the `Fish.info()` method, which in turn tries to get the Fish shell version, leading to a recursive loop. This causes the initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin to hang.
4. To fix the bug, we can differentiate the scenario where the command being executed is specifically `thefuck -v` and prevent the recursive loop in that case.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'thefuck -v' in sys.argv:
            return 'Fish Shell'
        
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding a simple check for the specific command `thefuck -v` in `sys.argv`, we can return 'Fish Shell' without triggering the command execution, hence avoiding the recursive loop issue.
