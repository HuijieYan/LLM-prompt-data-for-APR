### Potential Error Locations
1. Reading the output from `proc.stdout`. 
2. Handling the output string to extract the version information.
3. Creating the final string to return containing the version information.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the way the output from `proc.stdout` is being handled. The function is trying to read from `proc.stdout`, but just calling `read()` on it might not be enough to obtain the output correctly, especially if the process is still running or has not finished writing output. This could lead to an incomplete or corrupted version string being extracted.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the process has completed writing the output before reading from `proc.stdout`. One way to achieve this is by using the `communicate()` method of the subprocess.Popen object, which will wait for the process to complete and then return both stdout and stderr.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the output is correctly captured after the process has completed writing it. It should fix the issue reported on GitHub by properly handling the subprocess output.
