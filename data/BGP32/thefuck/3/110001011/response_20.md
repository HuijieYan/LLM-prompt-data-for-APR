### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command.
2. The subprocess command is using the `Popen` class to execute a command in the shell and capture the output.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that this function causes a recursive loop when the Oh-My-Fish plugin tries to regenerate functions, leading to a hang due to the way `thefuck -v` command is being used.
4. The current implementation seems to be correctly extracting the version from the output of the command, but the hang issue occurs when used in a certain context.

### Identified Issue:
The issue causing the hang and the recursive loop seems to be related to how the `FISH_VERSION` variable is being accessed and causing a loop within the shell environment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved to avoid any recursive loop caused by accessing or setting certain shell variables. It is also important to consider the context in which this function is being used to prevent any unintended recursive behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, I replaced `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` to directly get the version of the Fish shell without accessing any potentially harmful shell variables. This should prevent the hang and recursive loop issue mentioned on the GitHub thread.
