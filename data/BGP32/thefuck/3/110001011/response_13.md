### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is using `Popen` to run a command in the Fish shell and retrieve the version, but the way it's handling the output is causing issues. The `Popen` object is being used incorrectly, leading to potential hanging of the shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin when `thefuck -v` command is run.

### Error Locations
1. Inappropriate handling of `Popen` object.
2. Incomplete handling of the `Popen` object's output.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by not properly handling the `Popen` object and its output. The function is trying to read the `stdout` of the `Popen` object without waiting for the process to complete, leading to a potential hang.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly wait for the process to complete and then read the output. We should also ensure that any potential error handling is in place to prevent the shell initialization from hanging.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.stdout.close()  # Close the stdout stream
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have added `proc.wait()` to wait for the process to complete before reading the output. We have also included `proc.stdout.close()` to close the `stdout` stream after reading the output. These changes should prevent the potential hang during the shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
