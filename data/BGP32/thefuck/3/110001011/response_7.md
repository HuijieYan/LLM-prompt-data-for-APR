### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project.
2. The `info` function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess.
3. The bug causes the function to hang when trying to get the Fish shell version, especially when used in conjunction with the Oh-My-Fish plugin in a recursive loop.
4. The cause of the bug is likely related to how the subprocess is being handled, potentially leading to the hanging behavior.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the subprocess execution and the reading of its output.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    except Exception as e:
        version = "Unknown"
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this fix:
- We use `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the stdout of the process, which ensures that the subprocess is properly executed and its output is captured.
- We wrap the subprocess execution in a `try-except` block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process execution.
- If an exception occurs, we set the `version` to "Unknown" to provide a fallback value.
- This fix should prevent the hanging behavior and provide a proper version for the Fish shell.

By making these changes, the issue related to hanging of Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin should be resolved.
