### Identification of Potential Errors
1. The function `info` attempts to read the version of Fish shell using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue.
2. The use of `Popen` without handling potential exceptions or properly closing the process.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to a recursive loop triggered by the use of `thefuck -v` from Oh-My-Fish plugin, which leads to hanging the Fish Shell initialization. The buggy function `info` is likely contributing to this issue by not handling the subprocess `Popen` call properly, potentially causing the recursive behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the subprocess call is causing issues with recursive loops.
2. Handle exceptions appropriately and ensure the subprocess is closed after execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'set -q FISH_VERSION; and echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            proc.stdout.close()
        except Exception as e:
            version = "N/A"
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

### Changes Made
1. Added a check in the `fish -c` command to verify if `FISH_VERSION` is set before echoing it to prevent potential recursive issues.
2. Added exception handling to catch any errors that occur during subprocess execution.
3. Explicitly closed the subprocess stdout to prevent memory leaks.
