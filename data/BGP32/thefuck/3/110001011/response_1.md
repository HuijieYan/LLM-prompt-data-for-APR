### Potential Error Locations
1. Calling `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to finish could result in incomplete or missing output.
2. Using a specific version of Fish shell in the command might not always work for all versions which could lead to inconsistencies.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to calling `proc.stdout.read()` before ensuring that the process has completed and also relying on a specific version of Fish shell in the command. This can lead to incomplete output being read, causing the function to return incorrect information.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the process has completed before reading from its stdout. Additionally, we should consider a more robust way to get the version of Fish shell that is not dependent on a specific command.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output after the process has completed
        if not version:  # If version is empty, try another way to get the version
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            proc.wait()
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by waiting for the process to complete before reading from its stdout. It also provides an alternative way to get the version of Fish shell in case the original command fails.
