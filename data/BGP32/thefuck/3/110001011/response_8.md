### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the `proc.stdout.read()` method is being used might not be capturing the output correctly.
2. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` might not be returning the expected version value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the output from the Popen process. The `proc.stdout.read()` method might not be correctly capturing the output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This could lead to an incorrect version value being returned, causing issues with Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the correct version value.
2. Ensure that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is correctly capturing the output from the Popen process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to capture the output correctly. This should resolve the issue with Fish Shell initialization when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
