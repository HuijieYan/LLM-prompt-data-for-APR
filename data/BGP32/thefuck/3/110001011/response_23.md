### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed due to the use of `Popen` to check the Fish shell version. This recursive loop is triggered by Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, causing the initialisation to hang.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when the `info` function is called, it uses `Popen` to run the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to get the Fish shell version.
- However, when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, it calls the `info` function, which in turn tries to run the same command, leading to a recursive loop.
- This recursive loop causes the initialization to hang, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to ensure that it does not trigger a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. One way to do this is to check if the command being executed is `thefuck -v` and skip the version checking in that case.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return u'Fish Shell'
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By checking if `-v` is in `sys.argv`, we can avoid running the version check command when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. This change prevents the recursive loop and fixes the hanging issue during initialization caused by the recursive loop.
