### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command and capturing the output.
2. The function uses `Popen` to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the way it processes and retrieves the output seems to be causing issues.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that using the `-v` flag with `thefuck` plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function. This indicates that the current implementation is causing unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in how the function is reading and processing the output from the `Popen` process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by not properly handling the stdout of the `Popen` process, leading to issues when the function is called in certain contexts.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of directly reading the stdout of the process, it's better to communicate with the process using `communicate` method to avoid potential issues.
- Check if the output is empty before processing it to prevent errors when no version information is returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip() if stdout else 'Unknown'
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Used `communicate` method to interact with the process and retrieve the stdout.
2. Checked if the `stdout` is empty before decoding it to prevent errors.
3. If no version information is returned, it will now default to 'Unknown'.
