### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading its output. However, based on the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the variables `proc`, `version`, and related subprocess objects are implemented using `MagicMock` objects, which are not functioning correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect output from the function.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. The usage of `MagicMock` objects for `proc`, `version`, `proc.stdout`, etc., instead of actual subprocess objects may cause issues in extracting the correct version information.
2. An error may occur during the execution of the subprocess command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Explanation of the Bug

The bug arises due to the improper implementation of `MagicMock` objects instead of actual subprocess objects. As a result, the function fails to read the correct version output from the subprocess, leading to incorrect version information being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess command is executed properly and the output is read correctly. Using `MagicMock` objects for subprocess-related operations is not suitable, and we should use actual subprocess objects. Additionally, error handling should be included to manage any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            proc.communicate()  # Ensure the process is completed
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- Actual subprocess objects are used for `proc` and related operations instead of `MagicMock`.
- A try-except block is included to handle any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.
- `proc.communicate()` ensures that the subprocess is completed before reading its output.
