### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` and extracting the output. The issue is related to a recursive loop triggering when using the `-v` option.
   
2. The potential error location is at the point when the `Popen` command is executed and the output is read.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is read, it includes both the name "fish" and the version number, which causes the recursive loop when the function is called with the `-v` option.

4. To fix the bug, we will modify the `info` function to only extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the version of the current Fish shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By extracting only the version number from the output and removing the name "fish", we prevent the recursive loop issue.
