### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to fetch the version of Fish shell using a subprocess call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the test function, the expected version string is hardcoded, causing the test to fail due to a mismatch in the version formats.
2. The error occurs when the expected version 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual version 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
3. The bug is causing test failures due to mismatched version strings.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly extract the version string returned by the subprocess call and format it correctly before returning.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `replace('fish, version ', '')`, we extract only the version number from the returned string. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
