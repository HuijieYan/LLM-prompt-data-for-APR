### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The test function `test_info` is trying to validate if the correct shell information is returned by the `info` function.
3. The error message shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output includes additional text `'fish, version'`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that calling `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the bug in `info` function.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug can be identified in the `info` function where the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` instead of just the version number.

### Bug Cause:
When executing the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, the output is not just the version number but also includes the label `'fish, version'` which causes the extra text in the result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the command executed by `Popen` to just retrieve the version number without any additional text. We can use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to directly fetch the version information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
``` 

This corrected version fetches the version information directly from the command `['fish', '--version']` and extracts the version number accurately to provide the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
