### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, Fish.
2. The test function is mocking the `Popen` object's `stdout.read` method to return `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the actual output is not being parsed correctly by the buggy function.
3. The failing test and error message indicate that the output being returned by the `info()` function is not in the expected format.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the invocation of `thefuck -v` during initialization triggers a recursive loop, which suggests a potential issue in handling the version information.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `info()` function is caused by not parsing the output of the command properly. The returned version string includes additional characters like 'fish, version ' that need to be cleaned up before constructing the final output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy function to properly parse the version string returned by the `Popen` command.
2. Extract the version information from the returned string by splitting and cleaning it.
3. Update the function to construct the final output with the extracted version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string and extracting the actual version number, the `info()` function will now correctly return the version of the Fish shell without additional characters. This fix should resolve the failing test and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
