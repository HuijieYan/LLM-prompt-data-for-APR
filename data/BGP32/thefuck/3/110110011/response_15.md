### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
2. The failing test is calling the `info()` function and comparing the output with an expected version string.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output includes more than just the version number, causing the assertion to fail. This discrepancy is due to how the function is processing the command output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function reads and processes the output to extract only the version number for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is not correctly extracting just the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, leading to a comparison failure in the test.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to ensure it reads and processes the output to extract only the version number.
2. Update the test to match the format of the expected output after the bug fix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the function to use `['fish', '--version']` as the command and extracting the version number correctly, we can fix the bug. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
