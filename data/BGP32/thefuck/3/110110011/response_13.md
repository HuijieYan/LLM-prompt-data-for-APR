### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class**: The `info()` function within the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current Fish shell.
   
2. **Error Location**: The issue lies in the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version.
   
3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The `test_info()` function expects `'fish, version x.y.z\n'` as the output string from the shell version command, but the actual command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which results in a different format.
   - This mismatch leads to the AssertionError when comparing the expected and actual output strings.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing**: Modify the command in the `info()` function to retrieve the Fish shell version in the expected format required by the test function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function will run the correct command to get the Fish shell version in the desired format, resolving the mismatch issue encountered during testing.
