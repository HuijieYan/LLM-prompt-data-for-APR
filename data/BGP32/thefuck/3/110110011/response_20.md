### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output.
- **Test Code**: The failing test is trying to mock the version output and check if the function returns the correct version.
- **Error Message**: The assertion fails because the function is not parsing the version correctly.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue describes a specific problem related to the Fish shell initialization and usage of Oh-My-Fish plugin with the `thefuck` command.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect command being executed.
2. Incorrect parsing of the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed in the `info` function which results in incorrect parsing of the version string. The test is mocking the correct version output, but the function is not handling it properly, leading to a failed assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command being executed to get the correct version of the Fish shell.
2. Ensure that the function parses the output correctly to extract the version string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The command is updated to `['fish', '--version']`.
- The output is properly parsed to extract the version string.

This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version of the Fish shell, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
