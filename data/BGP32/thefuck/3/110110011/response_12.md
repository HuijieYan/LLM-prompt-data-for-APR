## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is designed to return the version of the Fish shell by running a command. However, there are issues with the command used to retrieve the version, leading to a failure in the test case provided.
2. The `info()` function is supposed to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version of the Fish shell.
3. The bug causes the function to return an incorrect version string due to the incorrect command run and improperly formatted output.
4. To fix the bug, the command executed needs to be adjusted to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version from the system's environment variable.
5. The correct version of the function should return the proper version string and align with the test case's expectations.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[-1].strip())  # Adjusted to extract only the version number
```

By making these changes to the `info()` function, the correct version string is returned, which will align with the expectations of the test case provided. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
