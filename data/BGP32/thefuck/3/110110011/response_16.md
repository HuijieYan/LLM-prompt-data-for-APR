## Analyzing the Bug

1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting it. However, it is currently not handling the output properly.

2. **Failing Test**: The test is setting up the `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `stdout.read()` is called. Then it checks if the returned shell info matches the expected version.

3. **Error Message**:
   - The error message indicates that the expected output for the `shell.info()` method does not match the actual output. It shows the mismatch between the two strings.
   - The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

4. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The issue mentions a problem with `thefuck` hanging due to the `Fish` shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The specific problem is related to the `info` function causing a recursive loop.
   - The fix for the issue is being worked on and is referenced in `oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the shell version output in the `info` function. The bug causes the version string to include unnecessary information leading to a mismatch with the expected version.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function should properly process the output of the `Popen` command to extract and format only the Fish shell version without any extra text.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function now properly extracts only the version information from the output and formats it as expected. This should resolve the mismatch issue and align the function's output with the test expectation.
