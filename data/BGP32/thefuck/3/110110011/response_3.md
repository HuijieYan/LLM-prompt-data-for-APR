### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version but is using the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.
2. The test function `test_info` is setting the expected output to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` based on the command `fish --version`.
3. The failing test is asserting the incorrect output due to the mismatch between the expected output and the actual output obtained from the incorrect command. The error message clearly points out the mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call needs to be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the correct version information.
5. Modifying the `Popen` call to use the correct command and format the version output correctly will resolve the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class will correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command. This change will ensure that the test function `test_info` passes successfully and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
