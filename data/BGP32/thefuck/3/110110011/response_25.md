### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is not correctly obtaining the version of the Fish shell. It is executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` but expecting `fish --version`.
2. The test function `test_info` is setting the `side_effect` with the output of `fish, version 3.5.9` but the `info` function is not using `fish --version` to fetch the version.
3. The error message shows that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. To fix the bug, the `info` function should execute `fish --version` to fetch the correct version string.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the inconsistency between the command being executed in the `info` function and the expected version string in the test function. The `info` function is using `$FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell instead of executing `fish --version`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `info` function to execute `fish --version` to fetch the correct version.
2. Modify the `test_info` function to expect the correct version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After correcting the `info` function in the `Fish` class, the test function should pass without any assertion errors.
