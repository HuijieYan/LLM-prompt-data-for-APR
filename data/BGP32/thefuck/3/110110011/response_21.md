### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` is attempting to read the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable to get the version of the Fish shell. However, in the test code, the expected version is hardcoded as `3.5.9`, which is causing the assertion error.
- The error message indicates that the actual output includes the full command output as well (`Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`), while the expected output is just the version number (`Fish Shell 3.5.9`).
- The GitHub issue suggests that using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to this issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the test trying to assert the full output of the shell command (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`) against only the version number (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`). This mismatch results in an assertion error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function in the `Fish` class to parse the command output correctly and extract only the version number. This way, it will match the expected output in the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, we are now extracting only the version number from the output of the shell command. This change will align the function output with the expected value in the test, resolving the assertion error and fixing the bug.
