### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `info()` inside the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file.
- The function calls `Popen` to run a command and extract a version number from the output.
- The failing test is testing the `info()` method by mocking the output of `Popen`.
- The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected result and the actual result.
- The GitHub issue highlights a recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect shell command used to retrieve the version number. The `info()` method uses `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, while the test expects the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to extract the version number in the `info()` method so that it matches the expectation in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the info() function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

By updating the command in the `info()` function to use `['fish', '--version']`, we can retrieve the version number in the correct format and pass the failing test.
