### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the expected output format is not being accounted for in the function.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock scenario where the output of `Popen(['fish', '--version'])` is simulated as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The failing test is asserting that the `info` function should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes unnecessary extra text which causes the assertion to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract just the version number from the output of the subprocess command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the Fish shell version output in the `info` function. The function is not correctly extracting just the version number from the output, resulting in unwanted text in the final output which causes the test to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly extract the version number from the subprocess output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version_output.split(', version ')[1].split('\n')[0]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will properly extract just the version number from the subprocess output and return it as `'Fish Shell <version_number>'`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
