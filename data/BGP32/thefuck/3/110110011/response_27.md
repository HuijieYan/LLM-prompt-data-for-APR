### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` is attempting to fetch the version number of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` and `PIPE`.
- The failing test `test_info` expects the version number to be fetched correctly and formatted as `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`.
- The error message indicates that the expected version string is different from the actual output due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the version.
- The GitHub issue mentions that using `-v` flag in `thefuck` triggers a recursive loop due to the incorrect implementation of `Fish.info()`.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function is fetching the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test expects the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.
- This discrepancy in the command used leads to a mismatch in the version string, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the command in the `Popen` call from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.
- Modify the function to correctly parse and format the version information obtained from the new command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

        # Extract version number from the command output
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()

        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making this correction, re-run the failing test and it should pass successfully. This fix aligns the version retrieval method with the expected format in the test, resolving the bug.
