### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and its Relationship**:
   - The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
   - The function uses `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version and then formats it to return the shell name and version.
   
2. **Error Location**:
   - The error is likely happening in how the version is fetched from the command output and formatted.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The failing test expects the output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the current implementation is not formatting the version correctly, which results in a mismatch.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the way the version output is handled to ensure it is correctly formatted as `'Fish Shell x.y.z'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the version retrieved is formatted correctly as `'Fish Shell x.y.z'` based on the provided failing test.
