### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship:** The buggy function `info` belongs to the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error is occurring when the `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` test fails. This indicates a discrepancy in the output of the `info` function.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being used to fetch the version in the `info` function.
   - The failing test is expecting the version string to be directly piped through `fish, version 3.5.9` but the actual output contains the additional prefix `fish`.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Modify the command used in the `Popen` call to fetch only the version number without any additional prefix.
   - Update the reading and formatting of the version string to match the expected output without the unnecessary prefix.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function in fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By modifying the command to `['fish', '--version']`, we can directly fetch the version without additional prefixes. Then by extracting the version number using `format(version.split(', version ')[1])`, we can remove the unnecessary prefix and return the correct version string.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
