### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `info` method of the `Fish` class in the `shells/fish.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell.
3. The test is mocking the output of running `fish --version` to be `fish, version 3.5.9`, but the function is retrieving the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is incorrect. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.
4. The bug is causing the test to fail because the expected version string is not being retrieved correctly.
5. To fix the bug, the function should run `fish --version` to get the correct version information.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Update the code in the `info` method to run `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Amend the `return` statement to format the version correctly.
3. Ensure that the test mock aligns with the correct expected version string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly retrieve the version using `fish --version` and format it properly for the assertion in the test to pass.
