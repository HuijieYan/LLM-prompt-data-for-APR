### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` method in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The current implementation is not correctly reading the version output.
   
2. **Failing Test**: The test is mocking the output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` to simulate the shell version retrieval. The assertion checks if the output of `shell.info()` matches the expected version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
   
3. **Error Message**: The assertion fails because the actual output includes additional text (`'fish, version'`) before the version number, causing the strings to not match.
   
4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue mentions that there is a problem with the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` in Fish Shell initialization, which is related to the `Fish.info()` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not reading the correct output from the command executed in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method incorrectly expects only the version number, leading to additional unwanted text ('fish, version') being present in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version output is read from the command execution. We should extract and parse the version number correctly, avoiding unnecessary text.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1]  # Extract only version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())
```

By updating the `info` method to read the correct output and extract the version number properly, the bug should be fixed.
