### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell.
   
2. **Test Code**: The test function `test_info` checks if the returned shell information is correct and also if the correct command is being passed to `Popen`.

3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the expected shell version returned by the function does not match the actual version.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue indicates that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to an issue in `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`.

### Bug Cause:
The `info` function is executing the command `'fish'` with the argument `'-c'` and `FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting `'fish --version'` to be called. This discrepancy in the command being executed and the expected command causes the mismatch in the version returned.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, the command executed in the `info` function should be changed from `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `'fish --version'` to align with the expectations of the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this adjustment, the `info` function will correctly return the version of the Fish shell, which will align with the test expectations and resolve the bug.
