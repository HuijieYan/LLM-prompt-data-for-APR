### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `Fish` class is `info()`, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The test is mocking the behavior of `Popen` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n`, but the actual output is not being correctly handled in the `info()` function.
3. The failing test indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `info()` function is not correctly parsing the shell version from the output of the command.
5. The fix involves updating the way the `info()` function extracts the version information from the command output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the output of the command to extract the version information. This requires modifying the `info()` function to correctly handle the output format returned by the `Popen` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number correctly
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the `info()` function will correctly extract the version number from the command output, resulting in the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as indicated by the failing test.
