### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class in `fish.py` file. The function is trying to get the version of Fish shell using `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
2. The test case `test_info` in `test_fish.py` sets up a mock for `Popen` to return the version output of Fish shell so that the `shell.info()` call can be tested.
3. The error is due to the fact that the version string returned includes the text `fish, version` which is not expected.
4. The root cause of the bug is that the command used to get the version is incorrect, leading to the unexpected version string.
5. To fix the bug, the correct command should be used to get the version of Fish shell.

### Bug Cause:
The bug was caused by using the incorrect command to get the version of the Fish shell, resulting in the inclusion of unwanted text in the version string.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the command in the `info` function to properly get the version from the Fish shell output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip() # Extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version number correctly, the corrected version of the function should now return the proper version string without the unwanted text.
