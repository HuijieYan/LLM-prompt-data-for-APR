## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. However, it is not retrieving the version correctly based on the provided command and parsing of the output.
2. The failing test `test_info` expects the output of `shell.info()` to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it currently returns a slightly different format.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output from `shell.info()` does not match the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish shell version should be corrected and the output parsing modified accordingly.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(["fish", "-v"], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Get the version from the output
        return f"Fish Shell {version}"
```

With the corrected version of the `info` function above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
