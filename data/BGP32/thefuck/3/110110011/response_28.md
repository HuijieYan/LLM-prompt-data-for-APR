## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class tries to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The test `test_info` sets up a mock subprocess `Popen` to return the version string when `stdout.read()` is called.
3. The error message indicates that the expected output of the function `info` does not match the actual output due to the version string containing additional information.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the test case hangs during initialization due to a recursive loop caused by the use of `thefuck -v`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in the version string returned by the `info` function and the expected version string in the test case. The command used in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) provides extra information along with the version number, causing the assertion error. This issue is further aggravated by the mentioned recursive loop due to incorrect handling of `thefuck -v`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the command in the `info` function to get only the version.
2. Update the test case to return a version string without additional information.
3. Ensure that the function returns the correct version string without extra information.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION | cut -d" " -f 1'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function will only extract the version number from the command output, resolving the discrepancy between the actual and expected version strings. This change should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
