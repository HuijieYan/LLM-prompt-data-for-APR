### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class defined in the `fish.py` file.
2. The `info` function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
3. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the output of the `Popen` call to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
4. The error message shows that the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output includes the unnecessary text `'fish, version'`.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that the command `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to an issue in `Fish.info()`.

### Error Cause:
The `info` function is directly using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version, which includes unnecessary text. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual output when the version is formatted.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command executed using `Popen` to directly get the Fish shell version without any additional unnecessary text.
2. Update the test to match the modified command output, removing the need for unnecessary text manipulation in the `info` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function directly uses `['fish', '--version']` to get the version number without any additional text. It also extracts only the version number for consistency.
