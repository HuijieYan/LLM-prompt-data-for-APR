### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, error message, GitHub issue

- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to extract the version number of the Fish shell by executing a command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. However, the test function `test_info` expects the version string in a different format ('fish, version x.x.x'). This leads to the failing assertion in the test.
- The error message indicates an assertion error due to a mismatch in the expected output of the function `info` in the `Fish` class and the actual output received during testing.
- The GitHub issue mentions that the usage of `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin causes a recursive loop due to this specific issue in the `Fish` shell implementation.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations in the `info` function are:
1. The command used to extract the version number may not be returning the expected output format.
2. The decoding and stripping operations on the output may not be handling the actual version string correctly.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the mismatch between the actual version string output obtained when executing the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and the expected version string format required by the test function. This discrepancy leads to the assertion error in the failing test.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function in the `Fish` class correctly extracts the version number in the expected format ('fish, version x.x.x'). This may involve adjusting the command being executed, handling the output string decoding, and formatting the final version string appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the `info` function

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]  # Extracting the version in the format 'x.x.x'
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command to 'fish --version', extracting the version string correctly, and formatting it in the expected 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format, the `info` function should now return the correct output and pass the failing test.
