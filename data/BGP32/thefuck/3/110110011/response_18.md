### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command with `Popen`. However, the command `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is incorrect for retrieving the version.
2. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the output of the subprocess command to test the `info` function in the `Fish` class.
3. The error message shows that the expected output doesn't match the actual output because the version string is not being retrieved correctly.
4. To fix the bug, the command executed in the subprocess should be changed to `'fish', '--version'` to get the correct Fish shell version.
5. Corrected version of the `info` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After making this correction, the `info` function should be able to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass successfully.
