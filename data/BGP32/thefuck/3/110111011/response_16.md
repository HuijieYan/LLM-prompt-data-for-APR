## Bug Analysis
- **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is meant to return the name and version of the Fish shell.
- **Test Code**: The failing test is checking if the returned value from `shell.info()` matches 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and is also checking the arguments passed to `Popen` during the function call.
- **Error Message**: The assertion error occurs because the expected string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual string returned by the function 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
- **Runtime Values**: The values fetched from the `proc.stdout.read()` are unexpected ('fish, version 3.5.9').

## Bug Explanation
- **Cause**: The error occurs because the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command used with `Popen` does not provide the exact version number only. It includes additional text ('fish, version 3.5.9') which is not required.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue describes a recursive loop due to the interaction between Oh-My-Fish plugin and the usage of `thefuck -v` causing delays due to this bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the command executed by `Popen` to only return the version number without any additional text. This can be achieved by modifying the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to a more suitable command that only outputs the version number.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_info.split()[2]  # Extracting just the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After implementing this correction, the function should only fetch the version number using the modified `Popen` command, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
