## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the version of the Fish Shell by executing a subprocess to retrieve the version information.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock for `Popen` to return a specific version string, but the assertion fails because the format of the returned string is different.
3. The error message indicates the mismatch in the expected and actual formatted version strings.
4. The cause of the bug is that the returned version string includes unnecessary text "fish, " along with the version number.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the processing of the version string obtained from the subprocess to only include the version number.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the obtained version string and taking the last part (assumed to be the version number), we can ensure that the version number is extracted correctly without the extra text. This fix should resolve the failing test and align with the intended functionality of the `info` function.
