### Fixing the Bug
1. **Error Location**: The error is likely occurring when trying to read the output of the `proc` process in the `info` function.
   
2. **Cause of the Bug**: The issue is caused by the incorrect command used to obtain the Fish shell version. The test case expects the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`, but the actual command used in the function is `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

3. **Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: Modify the command executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expectations of the failing test case.

4. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']`, the function now correctly retrieves the Fish shell version as expected by the failing test case. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the function to return the correct shell version.
