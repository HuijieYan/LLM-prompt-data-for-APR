### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info(self)` within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command using subprocess.
2. It seems that the function is not capturing the correct output from the subprocess call, leading to an incorrect version string being returned.
3. The failing test tries to assert that the returned version matches the expected version, but due to the incorrect output handling, the assertion fails.
4. A potential strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the correct command is executed, and its output is parsed correctly to extract the version information.
5. We need to modify the function to handle the output of the subprocess call and extract the version information accordingly.

### Correction:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Correcting the command to fetch version info
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_info = version.split(', version ')[-1]  # Parse the version string correctly
        return f'Fish Shell {version_info}'
```

By correcting the command used to fetch the version info and parsing the output string correctly, the corrected version of the `info()` function should now return the expected version information.
