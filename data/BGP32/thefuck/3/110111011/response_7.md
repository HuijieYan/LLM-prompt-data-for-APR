## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. It executes a subprocess to get the Fish version, but the command it uses to fetch the version is incorrect.
2. The failing test `test_info` mocks the subprocess to return a specific version string and then asserts that the `info` function of the `Fish` class correctly formats the version string.
3. The error occurs because the subprocess command used in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the version string returned in the test (`fish, version 3.5.9`). This results in a mismatch in the assertion.
4. To fix the bug, the subprocess command in the `info` function should be updated to fetch the Fish version in the correct format.
5. Implementing the correct subprocess command will make the `info` function return the expected output, passing the failing test.

## Bug Fix

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
``` 

By updating the subprocess command to `['fish', '--version']`, the correct version information will be obtained. This change will allow the `info` function to return the expected output format, resolving the failing test.
