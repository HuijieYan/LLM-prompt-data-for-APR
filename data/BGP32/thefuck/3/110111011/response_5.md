## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the expected output from the test is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` whereas the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
   
2. The error message indicates that the assert statement is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual strings representing the shell version.

3. The test is mocking the output of the `Popen` call to simulate the shell version retrieval. The issue appears to be with the way the version string is being extracted from the subprocess output.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The extraction of the version string from the subprocess output is not handled properly.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the command to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure that only the version number is returned without any additional text.
2. Update the string handling to extract and format the version number correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, we directly get the version number being printed by the shell. Splitting the output and retrieving the version correctly will fix the bug.
