### Identified Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is incorrectly parsing the version output from the `fish` shell command. It is not appropriately handling the returned version string, resulting in failing test cases and assertion errors.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect matching of the expected version string format and the actual retrieved version string from the `fish` shell command. The function is not accurately extracting the version number from the provided output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of extracting the version number from the output string correctly. This can be achieved by splitting the version string and obtaining only the numerical version part without any additional text.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function within the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version.split(", version ")[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By modifying the parsing logic to extract only the version number part from the output of the shell command, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the version comparison correctly and pass the failing test cases.
