## Analysis
- The `info()` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the command being executed `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not match the expected output format `['fish', '--version']` set in the test case, causing a mismatch in the version returned.
- The incorrect output returned by the function is causing the assertion error in the test case, leading to a test failure.

## Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is the misalignment between the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info()` function and the expected output format in the test case. The function returns the version in a different format than what is expected by the test case, resulting in a failed assertion.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info()` function to match the expected output format in the test case. This will ensure that the function returns the version in the correct format, allowing the test case to pass successfully.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the `info()` function will now correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell in the expected format. This change aligns the function output with the format expected by the test case, resolving the issue.
