### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect command used in Popen call: The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` used to get the version may not return the exact version string.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` may not be capturing the version string correctly.
3. Formatting of the string returned may be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version in the `info` function. The test is expecting `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while the current implementation is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy in the string format leads to the assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the command in the `Popen` call to ensure only the version string is returned without any additional text.
2. Capture and process the output from `proc.stdout` correctly to extract the version string.
3. Ensure proper formatting of the final return string to match the expected output in the test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version portion
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function uses the proper command `fish --version` in the `Popen` call to get the version string directly. It then processes the output to extract only the version part, ensuring that the return string matches the expected output in the failing test.
