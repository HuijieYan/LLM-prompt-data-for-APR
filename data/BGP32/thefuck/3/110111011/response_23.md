### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, in the failing test, the expected version is extracted from the output of `fish --version`, which causes a mismatch in the version format.
2. The `Popen` call in the function does not match the expected command to get the version.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the command used to extract the Fish shell version in the `info()` function and the expected version extraction in the failing test. This mismatch leads to an assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `Popen` call in the `info()` function to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Adjust the failing test to match the command used for version extraction in the `info()` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_str.split(' ')[2]  # Extract the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']` in the `info()` function, the correct Fish shell version can be extracted. The test should also be adjusted to validate against this format.
