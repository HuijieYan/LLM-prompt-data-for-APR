### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. However, in the failing test, the expected version value is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` which doesn't match the actual output obtained from the subprocess.
2. The assertion error in the failing test is due to the mismatch between the expected and actual shell version strings.
3. The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the version (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) is not retrieving the appropriate version string, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the obtained version with the expected one.
4. To fix the bug, the command executed by the subprocess needs to be modified to obtain the version string in the correct format.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version:
- The command `['fish', '--version']` is used to get the version of the Fish shell.
- The obtained version string is split based on `,` to extract only the version number.
- The extracted version number is then formatted to match the expected output.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
