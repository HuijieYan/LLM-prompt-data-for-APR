### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is meant to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. It uses Popen to execute a command to get the version information.
2. The failing test is trying to assert that the correct version information is returned by the `info` method.
3. The error message indicates that the expected output doesn't match the actual output, as the version information is not correctly formatted.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the version information is extracted and formatted in the `info` method.
5. The GitHub issue suggests that using `-v` triggers a recursive loop, which might be due to incorrect version extraction.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect parsing of the version information obtained from the command executed by Popen. This results in an incorrect comparison in the test.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the command sent to Popen to ensure that it retrieves the version information correctly.
2. Correctly extract and format the version information to match the expected output in the test.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function modifies the command to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure the version information is extracted correctly. It also correctly extracts the version number from the output obtained by stripping out unnecessary parts. This should address the bug and pass the failing test.
