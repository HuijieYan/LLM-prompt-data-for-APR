### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, it is reading the output incorrectly which causes the version string to include unwanted characters.
2. The failing test is asserting that the output of `shell.info()` should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but due to the incorrect handling of the command output, the actual output includes additional characters.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails due to a difference in the expected and actual output values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly read and strip the output from the subprocess command to only extract the version string without any additional characters.
5. The corrected version of the `info` function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string based on `', '`, we can extract only the version number without any additional characters. This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
