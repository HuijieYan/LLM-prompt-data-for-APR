### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, in the failing test, the expected version format is different from the actual output format, leading to the assertion error.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring due to the mismatch in the expected version format ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and the actual output format ('fish, version 3.5.9').

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the expected version format and the actual output format from the command execution. The failing test has a fixed expected format, which the function `info` is not currently returning.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `info` should be modified to extract the correct version information from the output of the Fish shell version command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_info = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_info)
```

In the corrected version, the command executed is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to obtain the correct version information. Additionally, the version output is split using ',' and the second part is considered as the version information to match the expected format.
