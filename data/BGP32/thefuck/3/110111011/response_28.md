### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, but the test expects the version output in a different format.
   
2. **Failing Test**: The failing test is setting the expected version output to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

3. **Error Location**: The discrepancy in the format of the version output is causing the assertion error in the test. The function is not formatting the version string correctly.

4. **Bug Cause**: The `info` function is returning the version string as `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the required format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

5. **GitHub Issue**: The issue relates to a hang in the Fish Shell initialization caused by a recursive loop due to the behavior of the `info` function in `thefuck` plugin when using `-v` option.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the version string is formatted in the `info` function to match the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. By correcting the string formatting, the test should pass successfully.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string retrieved from the command output and formatting it correctly in the return statement, the corrected function should now return the version in the expected format.

This fix should resolve the assertion error in the test case provided.
