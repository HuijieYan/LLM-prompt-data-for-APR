### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the test is expecting the output of `fish --version`.
2. The error message indicates that the actual output format doesn't match the expected format.
3. The runtime values show that the version extracted from the command doesn't match the format expected by the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the command to fetch the version information correctly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

By changing the command to `fish --version`, we ensure that the version information is retrieved in the expected format. Additionally, we extract the version number correctly by splitting the output string at `', '` since the version number comes after the comma.
