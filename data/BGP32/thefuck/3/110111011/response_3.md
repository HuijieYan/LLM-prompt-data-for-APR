## Identifying the Issue

The issue in the buggy function `info` lies in the command being used in `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell. The correct command should be `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This incorrect command is causing the version string to be extracted incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

## Solution Strategy

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to retrieve the version of the Fish shell correctly by using `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly extract the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
