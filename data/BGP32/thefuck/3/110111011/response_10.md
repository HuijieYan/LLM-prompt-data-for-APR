### Identified Issues:
1. The command being used in Popen is 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', but in the test, it is asserted that Popen.call_args[0][0] should be ['fish', '--version']. This inconsistency is causing the test to fail.
2. The assertion in the test is based on a different output format ('fish, version 3.5.9') compared to what the info function is returning ('Fish Shell 3.5.9'). This discrepancy is leading to an assertion error.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is the mismatch between the command being executed in the Popen call and the expected command in the test case. Additionally, the output format not matching what is expected by the test results in a failed assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the Popen call to use the correct command 'fish --version' to align with the test case expectations.
2. Modify the info function to format the version output in the same format as expected by the test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Updated Test Function
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these changes, the test case should now pass as the Popen call and the return value from the info function align with the expected values specified in the test.
