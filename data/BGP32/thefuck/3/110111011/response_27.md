### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the output of the command and expecting the function to return a specific format for the shell name and version.
3. The error message highlights an assertion error due to a mismatch in the expected output format.
4. The input parameter `proc` is a MagicMock object representing the Popen call, and `version` is a string containing the output of the command.
5. The GitHub issue suggests that this recursive loop issue is related to Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `info` method not properly formatting the retrieved version information before returning it. The test case expects the output to be formatted as `Fish Shell X.X.X`, but the obtained output is in a different format.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` method to correctly format the version information before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the version string on commas and whitespaces and extracting the version number correctly, we ensure that the output matches the expected format.
