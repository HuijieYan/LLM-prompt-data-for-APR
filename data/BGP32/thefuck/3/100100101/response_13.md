### Analysis
1. The `info` function is supposed to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the shell.
2. The current code reads the output of the command incorrectly by directly calling `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.
3. The failing test provides a sample output of the command which is `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is expected to extract only the version number '3.5.9'.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how we process the output of the command to extract only the version number.
5. We also need to update the test to reflect the corrected behavior.

### Bug Fix
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to get version info
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

### Corrected Test Function
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']  # Updated expected call to match the corrected function
```
