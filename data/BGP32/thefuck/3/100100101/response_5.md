### Analysis
- The buggy function is using `Popen` to run a command to retrieve the Fish shell version and then formats it to return the name and version of the shell.
- The failing test sets up a `Popen` mock to return a specific version string, but the function is not reading the correct output from `Popen`.

### Bug Explanation
- In the original code, the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is used to retrieve the version, but in the failing test, the expected version string is directly returned in the mock output.
- The function then tries to read from `proc.stdout`, which does not match the expected value set in the test, leading to a mismatch and test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the function to directly return the version string provided in the mock output, instead of trying to read it from `proc.stdout`.
- Update the function to process the provided version string and return the correct formatted result.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Use '--version' to directly get the version
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract the version string from the output without running the command
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract version from the output string
    
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Return the formatted version string

```
