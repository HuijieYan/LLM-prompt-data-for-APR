### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in the shell using `Popen` and retrieve the output.
2. The `Popen` is called with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` which may not be the correct command to get the Fish shell version.
3. The failing test sets the side effect of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, but the function is reading and stripping the version incorrectly which causes the test to fail.

### Bug
The bug is in the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version and the incorrect process of reading and decoding the output of the `Popen` call.

### Fix
1. Change the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly get the version.
2. Instead of directly calling `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to get the version, read and decode the output incrementally to prevent any loss of data.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = b''
    while True:
        output = proc.stdout.read(4096)
        if not output:
            break
        version += output
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After correcting the function as shown above, it should pass the failing test case.
