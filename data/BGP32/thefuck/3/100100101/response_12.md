### Analysis
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using Popen, but the command used to get the version `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not match the one expected in the test `['fish', '--version']`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation
- The `Popen` call in the buggy function uses the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, which is not equivalent to the expected command `['fish', '--version']` in the test.
- The test sets the expected output of the Popen call to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the buggy function reads the output and expects a version number only without the 'fish, version' part.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to match the expected command in the test. Additionally, we need to extract the version number correctly from the output obtained by `Popen`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_info.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After applying these changes, the corrected function will match the expected command in the test and correctly extract the version number from the output, passing the failing test case.
