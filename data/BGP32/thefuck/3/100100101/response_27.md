### Analysis
1. The `info` function is supposed to retrieve the current shell's version by running a command in the Fish shell. The issue lies with the command used to retrieve the version, which should be `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The test function is setting the side effect of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which doesn't match the actual command executed by the function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `info` function is trying to retrieve the version information using the wrong command (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`). This leads to an incorrect version being returned, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to run the correct command (`'fish', '--version'`) to retrieve the version information accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return f'Fish Shell {version_info}'
```
