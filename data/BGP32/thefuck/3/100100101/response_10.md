### Analysis
- The `info` function is supposed to fetch the version of the Fish shell using `Popen` and return a formatted string with the version.
- The current implementation is trying to fetch the version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` as a command and reading the output from the process.
- The failing test is setting up the `Popen` mock to return the version string in a specific format, but the function is trying to read the output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which is not in line with the format set in the test.
- The expected call to `Popen` in the failing test is `['fish', '--version']`, but the actual call is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the expected output format set in the test and the way the function is trying to read the output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the test setup to return the output in the format expected by the current implementation of the function.
2. Adjust the function's logic to read the version information according to the new format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` call is modified to use `['fish', '--version']` as expected by the test. The function should now pass the failing test.
