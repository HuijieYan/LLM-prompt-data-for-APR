### Analysis
- The buggy function `info` is using `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the fish version.
- The test is setting up the `Popen` instance to return the version string, but the expected version in the test is different from the output of the command.
- The command used in the function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) may not be providing the version in the expected format.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in the expected version ('3.5.9') and the actual version retrieved from the command output ('fish, version 3.5.9\n').

### Strategy for Fixing
- Modify the command executed by `Popen` to obtain the version in the correct format.
- Parse the received version string to extract the necessary version number.
- Update the function to return the formatted version string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version_str = version_bytes.decode('utf-8')
    
    version_parts = version_str.split(', version ')
    if len(version_parts) == 2:
        version = version_parts[1]
    else:
        version = version_str
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function above addresses the issue by changing the command to retrieve the version, parsing the version string, and returning the correct format. This version should now pass the failing test case.
