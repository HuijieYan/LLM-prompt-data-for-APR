### Identify the Bug
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is trying to extract the version information from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but in the test case, the expected version number is directly provided as `fish, version 3.5.9`.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `info` function is trying to extract the version information using `$FISH_VERSION`, which is not directly matching the format provided in the test case.
2. The test case sets the expected version to `3.5.9`, but the function tries to read it from the output of the command, leading to a mismatch.

### Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to return the expected version directly instead of using a command to retrieve it. This can be done by parsing the version string returned by the command and extracting the actual version number.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string and extracting only the version number, we ensure that the function returns the expected version number, which will align with the test case's expectation.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
