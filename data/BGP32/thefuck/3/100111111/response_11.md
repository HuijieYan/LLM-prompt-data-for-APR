### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is trying to obtain the Fish Shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using subprocess Popen. It then tries to extract the version from the output and format it as `'Fish Shell {version}'`.
   
2. The failing test in `test_fish.py` sets up the Popen return value to simulate the output of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` and expects the formatted version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Potential Error Location
- The issue seems to be with how the version is being extracted and formatted from the command output. The discrepancy appears to be between the expected version string and the actual extracted version.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be due to the incorrect formatting of the version string in the `info` function. The test provides the version as `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function incorrectly extracts it. 

The section `fish, version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` in the error message indicates that the extracted version is not matching the expected version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
- Modify the way the version is extracted from the output of the command, ensuring that only the version number is obtained without any other unwanted characters.
- Update the version extraction logic and string formatting to match the expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number by splitting the string at commas and spaces, and take the last part
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```
