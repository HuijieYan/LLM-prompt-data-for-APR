## Bug Explanation

### Issue
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file causes incorrect output due to reading the wrong value from the process and not parsing the version number correctly.

### Explanation
1. The `Popen` call is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to fetch the Fish shell version number.
2. The test function sets the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to simulate the output of the command as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The function reads this output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which results in `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The function then returns `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`, resulting in `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
5. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is incorrect due to not parsing the version correctly.

### Solution
1. To fix the bug, you need to extract just the version number from the output string and return it in the expected format.

## Bug-fixed Code

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using the `split` method to extract the version number portion after ", version ", we can ensure that the correct version number is returned and formatted as expected in the output.
