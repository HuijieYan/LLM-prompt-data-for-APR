Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by reading the output of the command incorrectly, resulting in additional text that needs to be removed before formatting the version info.

The root cause is that the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is returning additional information along with the version number, leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected version number.

To fix this bug, the output of the command needs to be parsed to extract only the version number before formatting the output string.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract version number from the complete output
    version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction will ensure that only the version number is used when formatting the shell information. It should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
