## Fixing the Bug

### 1. Issue Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell.
- The failing test `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file is asserting the wrong output due to incorrect parsing of the version information.
- The error message indicates a mismatch in the version information format.
- The provided runtime values and expected values also reveal that the version information is not extracted correctly.

### 2. Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with how the version information is extracted and formatted in the `info` function.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting and extraction of the version information from the output, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual results.

### 4. Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the command to get the version information by using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Parse the version information correctly from the output to ensure it matches the format expected by the test.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly retrieves and formats the version information, aligning with the expectations of the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue related to recursive looping in Fish Shell initialization.
