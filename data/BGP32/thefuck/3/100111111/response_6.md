### Buggy Function Analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. However, due to a misunderstanding in the test, the expected version is different from the actual output. The test is looking for 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' while the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

### Error Identification
The issue lies in the way the version string is being formatted. The function takes the version string directly from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command without parsing it correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the test to fail because the expected version '3.5.9' does not match the actual version 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This is due to the entire string 'fish, version ' being retained before the actual version in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is parsed so that only the version number is retained.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By splitting the output of the command based on commas and taking the last part, we can extract only the version number. This corrected function should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected by the test.
