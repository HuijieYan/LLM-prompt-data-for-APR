## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the fish shell environment and extracting the version from the output.
2. The failing test `test_info` sets up a scenario where the `Popen` mock object returns a specific version number when the `info` function is called. However, the comparison fails due to an unexpected prefix in the obtained version.
3. The error message indicates that the obtained version has an additional prefix of `'fish, '`.
4. The runtime values show that the `version` variable includes this unexpected prefix while testing, leading to a failed assertion.
5. To fix the bug, the function should extract only the version number without any additional text.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `info` function not correctly extracting only the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell. This results in the version string including the additional text `'fish, version '` which causes the assertion to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the obtained output without any additional text.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().lstrip('fish, version ')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version number without any additional prefix, resolving the bug and making the failing test pass.
