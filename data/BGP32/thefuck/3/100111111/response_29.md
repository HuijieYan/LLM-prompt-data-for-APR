## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file is currently retrieving the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and reading the output. However, the test in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` expects the version to be extracted from `fish --version` output.
2. The failing test indicates that the discrepancy between the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` is the cause of the assertion error.

### Bug Cause
- The `info` function incorrectly fetches the Fish shell version using the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
- The assertion in the test is based on the assumption that the version is retrieved from `'fish --version'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Update the `info` function to execute `fish --version` command and extract the version from its output.
- Ensure that the extracted version aligns with the expected format in the test.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return f"Fish Shell {version}"
``` 

By updating the `info` function as shown above, the function will correctly retrieve the Fish shell version from `fish --version` command output and pass the failing test.
