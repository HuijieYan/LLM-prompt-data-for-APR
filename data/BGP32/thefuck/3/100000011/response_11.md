### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through Popen. However, as indicated in the GitHub issue, using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the way the version information is being retrieved in the `info` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Using `thefuck -v` command to get the Fish shell version.
2. The method of extracting the version information from the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the `info` function in `shells/fish.py` retrieves the Fish shell version. When `thefuck -v` command is executed within the function, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way version information is extracted from the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid using `thefuck -v` and find an alternative method to retrieve the Fish shell version without triggering the recursive loop. This may involve directly querying the Fish shell for its version information without causing conflicts with the `thefuck` plugin.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are directly querying the Fish shell for its version information using `echo $version` command within the `info` function. This should avoid the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` command and provide the correct version of the Fish shell.
