### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is attempting to get the version of the Fish Shell using a subprocess. However, based on the GitHub issue, it seems that calling `thefuck -v` in Oh-My-Fish with the TheFuck plugin triggers a recursive loop due to how the version check is implemented in `Fish.info()`. 

### Error Locations:
1. The issue seems to be related to the specific way the version of Fish Shell is being retrieved.
2. The function may be causing a recursive loop leading to hangs in the shell initialization.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered due to the way the version check is implemented in `Fish.info()`. This leads to hangs during the shell initialization process, especially when `thefuck -v` is called by Oh-My-Fish with the TheFuck plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative method to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell that does not trigger the recursive loop. It's important to ensure that the version retrieval process does not interfere with the functionality of other plugins calling `thefuck -v`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    shell_name = 'Fish Shell'
    
    # Retrieve the version of the Fish Shell using 'fish --version' command
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    return u'{} {}'.format(shell_name, version)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `fish --version` command to get the version of the Fish Shell.
- By using a direct command instead of relying on environment variables like `$FISH_VERSION`, we avoid triggering any potential recursive loops related to other plugins.
- The function now correctly returns the shell name followed by its version without introducing any side effects that may conflict with other plugins.
