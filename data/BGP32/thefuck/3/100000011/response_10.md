### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with the usage of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop, causing hangs during Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved using `Popen`.
2. The handling of the command that triggers recursive looping issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function attempting to get the Fish shell version using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which causes problems with certain configurations, especially when the command triggers a loop. This leads to the reported bug where `thefuck` hangs during initialization.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative way to retrieve the Fish shell version that doesn't trigger the reported recursive loop issue. Additionally, we need to make sure that the fix doesn't cause hangs during `thefuck` initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, I have used `os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This approach directly fetches the environment variable `FISH_VERSION` without running any potentially recursive commands, avoiding the reported issue with hangs during initialization.
