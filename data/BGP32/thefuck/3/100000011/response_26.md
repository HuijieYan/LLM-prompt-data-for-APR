**Analysis:**
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that this causes a recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish due to calling `thefuck -v` within TheFuck plugin. The fix for the issue is to prevent this recursive loop.

**Identified Error Locations:**
1. The subprocess call within the `info` function to get the Fish shell version.
2. The potential recursive loop caused by using `thefuck -v` within the plugin.

**Cause of Bug:**
The bug is caused by the usage of `thefuck -v` within the plugin triggering a recursive loop due to the way the version information is fetched in the `info` function. This recursive loop leads to hanging Fish Shell initialization.

**Suggested Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to avoid triggering the recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is called within the plugin. One possible approach is to check if the command being executed is `thefuck -v` and handle it differently to prevent the recursive loop.

**Corrected Version:**
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function that prevents the recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is called within the plugin:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return u'Fish Shell (version not available)'
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the argument `-v` is present in the command line arguments (indicating `thefuck -v` is being called). If so, we return a message indicating that the version information is not available. This change prevents triggering the recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.
