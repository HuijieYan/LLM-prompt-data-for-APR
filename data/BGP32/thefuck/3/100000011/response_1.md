### Analysis:
The buggy function `info(self)` in the `fish.py` file of TheFuck tool is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command within a subprocess. However, this has caused an issue where the tool hangs during the initialisation process in Fish shell when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The GitHub issue highlights that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the `info()` function in `fish.py`, leading to a hang during the initialisation process.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the command is executed using Popen might be causing the hang.
2. Reading the output from `stdout` might not be happening correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the infinite loop triggered by the use of `thefuck -v`, which calls `info()` in `fish.py` to retrieve the Fish shell version. This recursive call leads to a hang in the initialization process.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the command execution using `Popen` does not lead to an infinite loop.
2. Check the way the output is read from the subprocess to prevent hanging issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, I have replaced `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()` to ensure that the output is correctly read from the subprocess without causing a hang. This change should prevent the infinite loop issue described in the GitHub report.
