### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `shells/fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to get the Fish shell version using a subprocess. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that using the `-v` flag with `thefuck` triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to complete.
2. Using `thefuck` command with `-v` causing a recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop because of how the `info` function is trying to get the Fish shell version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `info` function to avoid the recursive loop caused by the `-v` flag with `thefuck`. Additionally, we need to ensure proper handling of the subprocess to read the version correctly without causing any issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'THEFUCK_ALIAS' in os.environ:
        # Avoid recursive loop with TheFuck alias
        return "Fish Shell"

    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'printf "%s" $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    except:
        # If version retrieval fails, return default
        version = "Unknown"

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, we have added a check to avoid the recursive loop when `THEFUCK_ALIAS` environment variable is present. We also modified the subprocess command to properly retrieve the Fish shell version using `printf` and `communicate()` to avoid any issues. In case of an exception, we return a default "Unknown" version.

By implementing these changes, the `info` function should now correctly return the Fish shell version without causing the reported recursive loop issue in the GitHub thread.
