### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

The buggy function in `fish.py` is being used in the context of the `thefuck` plugin for the Fish Shell. The `info` function is supposed to return the version of the current Fish Shell by executing the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the GitHub issue indicates that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function. This recursive loop is caused by calling `thefuck -v` which eventually leads to the `info` function being executed again.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error location in the `info` function is how it interacts with the `thefuck -v` command and the way it retrieves the Fish Shell version. The use of `proc.stdout.read()` followed by `decode('utf-8')` might be causing issues in the context of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug occurs because the `info` function is indirectly creating a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` triggers the function to retrieve the Fish Shell version, thus leading to repeated executions of the same command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to check if the function is being called in the context of `thefuck -v` and handle this scenario differently to avoid the recursive loop. This can be achieved by checking the command being executed and taking appropriate action.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def info(self, caller=None):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if caller == 'thefuck' or caller == 'plugin-thefuck':
        return "Fish Shell"
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `caller` parameter is introduced to differentiate the context in which the function is being called.
- If `caller` is 'thefuck' or 'plugin-thefuck', the function returns a generic "Fish Shell" string to avoid triggering the recursive loop.
- The version retrieval process is modified to `proc.communicate()[0]` for improved handling of the command output.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub referencing `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
