### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the file fish.py of the TheFuck project is using the `Popen` function incorrectly to get the version number of the Fish Shell. This incorrect usage is causing a recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, leading to a hang during initialization.

### Potential Error:
The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to complete, which may lead to a hang during execution.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not waiting for the `Popen` process to complete before reading its output, causing a hang during initialization when used with Oh-My-Fish.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the `Popen` process to complete before reading its output. This can be achieved by using the `communicate` method of the process object, which will wait for the process to finish before returning.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the process completes before extracting the version number. This should prevent the hang during initialization when used with Oh-My-Fish as reported in the GitHub issue.
