### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of `thefuck` project is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish due to the way it tries to retrieve the Fish version. This recursive loop leads to hanging the Fish Shell initialization.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `info` function where it attempts to get the Fish Shell version by executing a command that triggers a recursive loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is triggered by the way `info` function in `fish.py` file tries to get the Fish Shell version using a command that is executed recursively when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish. This leads to the hanging of the Fish Shell initialization process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the Fish Shell version is retrieved within the `info` function to prevent the recursive loop. Instead of executing a command that triggers a recursive loop, we can directly access the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable to get the Fish Shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, the corrected version of the function avoids the recursive loop issue and properly retrieves the Fish Shell version without causing hanging during Oh-My-Fish initialization when using the `thefuck` plugin.
