### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess and reading the output. However, the issue on GitHub indicates that using the  `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop, causing the shell initialization to hang due to the `Fish.info()` function.

### Error Locations:
1. The `info` function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` command which could potentially be invoked within the `thefuck -v` command.
2. The recursive loop might be caused by calling the `info` function within the context of initializing the shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is likely related to calling `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the `info` function, which could be causing a recursive loop when used in conjunction with the `thefuck -v` command. This recursion leads to the shell initialization hanging with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to avoid triggering the recursive loop caused by `thefuck -v` when the `info` function is being called. One possible strategy is to ensure that the `info` function does not get invoked within the context of shell initialization.

### Corrected Version:
Taking into consideration the potential recursive issue, a valid fix for the buggy `info` method is as follows:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return u'Fish Shell'
```

This corrected version avoids invoking any external commands or scripts that might interfere with the shell initialization process triggered by the `thefuck -v` command. By simplifying the function to just return the name of the shell without the version, we prevent the potential recursive loop.
