### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that using `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish plugin is causing a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Using `thefuck -v` triggering the `info` function.
2. Reading the output of the process without handling it properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that when `info` function is called, it runs `thefuck -v` internally which triggers the same `info` function, leading to an infinite recursion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative way to get the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop. One approach could be to directly obtain the version information without triggering the `info` function again.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = 'N/A'
    
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    except:
        pass
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output of the process `Popen` without causing an issue with the recursive loop. Additionally, we handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the process. This approach should prevent the recursive loop and provide the correct version information for the Fish shell.
