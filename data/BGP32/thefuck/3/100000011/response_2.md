### Analysis:
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to get the version of the Fish Shell by running a command using `Popen`, reading the output, and formatting it into a string. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that using the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to this function, causing hangs in Fish Shell initialization when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the output from the subprocess before it completes, leading to a potential hang.
2. Incorrect handling of decoding the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function trying to read the output of the subprocess synchronously without waiting for its completion. This behavior can trigger a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` command is used, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to complete before reading its output. Additionally, we should ensure that we handle the decoding of the output correctly to prevent any issues related to text encoding.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to wait for the subprocess to complete and get its output.
- The output is then decoded correctly with `decode('utf-8')`.
- The output is stripped to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces before formatting into the final string.

This corrected version should prevent the recursive loop issue when using `thefuck -v` with the Fish Shell and Oh-My-Fish plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.
