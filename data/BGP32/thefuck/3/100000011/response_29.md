### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file extracts the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `thefuck -v` command is used with Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way `Fish.info()` function is implemented, which causes the Fish shell to hang during initialization.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `echo $FISH_VERSION` command within the `Popen` call.
2. Reading the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `info` function directly executes a command to fetch the Fish shell version without checking the context in which it is called. When the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers the execution of `thefuck -v`, it indirectly calls the `info` function, resulting in a recursive loop as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function such that it can handle the recursive calls within the context of execution triggered by the Oh-My-Fish plugin. One possible strategy could be to check if the command execution is in a recursive context due to the plugin and to return a default value in such cases to prevent the recursive loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if os.getenv("TF_FISH_INFO_RECURSIVE"):
        # Prevent recursive loop caused by Oh-My-Fish plugin
        return u'Fish Shell (Unknown Version)'
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the environment variable `TF_FISH_INFO_RECURSIVE` is set, which indicates a recursive context. If it is set, the function returns a default value. This prevents the recursive loop caused by the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
