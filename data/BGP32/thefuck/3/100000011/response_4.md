### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, this approach leads to a recursive loop when used in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin's TheFuck functionality, causing a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

The issue arises because the `info` function is being called recursively when TheFuck plugin uses `thefuck -v`, triggering a loop and causing the hang.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely in the way the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved in the `info` function and the subsequent handling of this information.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` within the `info` function, which is used for retrieving the Fish shell version. This causes a hang when the TheFuck plugin uses `thefuck -v`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find a different way to obtain the Fish shell version that does not lead to recursion when interacting with the Oh-My-Fish plugin's TheFuck feature. One possible approach could be to extract the version information directly from the environment or configuration files instead of executing a command that could cause a recursive loop.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in `fish.py` file:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the Fish version is obtained using `os.getenv('FISH_VERSION', 'Unknown')`, which directly retrieves the value of `FISH_VERSION` from the environment variables. This avoids the recursive loop issue and ensures that the function works properly with the Oh-My-Fish plugin's TheFuck functionality.
