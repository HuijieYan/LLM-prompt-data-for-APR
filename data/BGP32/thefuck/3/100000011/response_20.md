### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `thefuck -v` command was causing a recursive loop in the Fish Shell initialization when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This bug was identified to be in the `Fish.info()` method within the `shells/fish.py` file of the project.

### Identified Error Location:
The problematic part in the buggy function is the usage of `thefuck -v` command triggering the `Fish.info()` method, which in turn recursively calls back the `thefuck -v` command. This results in a loop causing the Fish Shell initialization to hang.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `info` method in `shells/fish.py` of the `thefuck` project attempts to fetch the Fish Shell version by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. However, this method is invoked by the `thefuck -v` command, which is used by the Oh-My-Fish plugin to check for updates.
3. When `thefuck -v` command calls `Fish.info()`, it leads to an infinite loop as fetching the Fish Shell version becomes recursive due to the same command being executed within the `info` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To prevent the recursive loop and resolve the hanging issue during Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, we need to avoid calling the `thefuck -v` command within the `Fish.info()` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return u'Fish Shell'
```

By simply returning a static string `'Fish Shell'` instead of attempting to fetch the Fish Shell version dynamically, we prevent the recursive loop and the hanging issue during initialization. This fix will alleviate the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to the `thefuck -v` command.
