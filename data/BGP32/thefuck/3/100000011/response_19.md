### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running a subprocess. The issue pointed out on GitHub indicates that using the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `Fish.info()` method.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The subprocess creation using `Popen`.
2. Reading the output from the subprocess.
3. Formatting the version information.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` method in `fish.py` triggering a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, leading to hanging during Fish Shell initialization. This issue arises due to the way the version of the Fish Shell is being retrieved and formatted inside the `info` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version of the Fish Shell is retrieved to avoid the recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. We should consider an alternative way to obtain the version information that does not cause the hanging issue during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = 'N/A'
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode == 0:
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    except Exception:
        pass
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, I have changed the way the version information is obtained to prevent the recursive loop caused by `thefuck -v` command. The version is now retrieved using `fish -v`, and proper error handling is implemented to avoid any issues during the process. Now, the function should return the version of Fish Shell without causing hanging or recursion.
