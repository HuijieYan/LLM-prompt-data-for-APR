### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
2. The function is using `Popen` to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the Fish Shell version.
3. The GitHub issue states that when the `thefuck -v` command is used in conjunction with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop because of the `info` function in the `fish.py` file.
4. The issue seems to arise from the fact that using `thefuck -v` in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin invokes the `info` function, which in turn triggers the execution of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, leading to the recursive loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `info` function to check if it is being invoked as a part of fetching the shell version due to the `thefuck -v` command. We can do this by adding a check to differentiate between regular invocation of the `info` function and invocation due to the `thefuck -v` command. If it is the latter case, we can return a message indicating that it's the fetch for shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self, is_thefuck_v=False):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if is_thefuck_v:
        return u'Fetching Fish Shell version for thefuck -v'
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In order to implement this solution, make sure to modify the call to `info` function where it's being invoked due to the `thefuck -v` command to pass `is_thefuck_v=True`. This modification should prevent the recursive loop and resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.
