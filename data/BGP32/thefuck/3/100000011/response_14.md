### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` attempts to get the version of Fish shell using `Popen` to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, this leads to a recursive loop issue when triggered by the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading output from `proc.stdout` before waiting for the command to finish.
2. Using `thefuck -v` in the plugin, which recursively calls `info`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the Oh-My-Fish plugin calling `thefuck -v`, which in turn triggers `Fish.info()` to get the Fish shell version. As `info` in fish.py directly reads from the `proc.stdout` without waiting for the command to finish, it creates a loop leading to a hang.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the call to `thefuck -v` in the plugin to prevent the recursive loop.
2. Modify the `info` function to wait for the command to finish before reading its output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to wait for the command to finish and capture its output. This modification prevents the recursive loop caused by reading from `proc.stdout` directly.
