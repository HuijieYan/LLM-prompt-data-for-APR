### Analysis:
The bug is related to the `info` method in `fish.py` which is used to get the version of the Fish Shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `thefuck -v` command hangs Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin due to a recursive loop triggered by calling the `info` method.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`: Reading from `proc.stdout` may cause the hang.
2. Not handling errors or exceptions in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `thefuck -v` is called, it tries to get the version of the Fish Shell by calling the `info` method. The `info` method executes a command to get the version, but the way it reads the output from the process may cause it to hang or get stuck.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command execution does not hang and handle any potential errors that may occur during the process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        output, error = proc.communicate()
        
        if error:
            return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version'

        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- `proc.communicate()` is used to read both the output and error streams from the process.
- Error handling is added to check for any errors that occur during the execution of the command.
- If an error occurs, an error message is returned.
- Any exceptions that may arise are caught and handled gracefully by returning an error message.

This updated version should prevent the hang caused by the original function and provide a more robust error handling mechanism.
