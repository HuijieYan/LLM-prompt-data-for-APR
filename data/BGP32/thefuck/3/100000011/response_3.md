### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running a subprocess command. However, the subprocess command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is causing a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish uses the command `thefuck -v`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The subprocess command might be triggering a recursive loop due to how it's retrieving the Fish shell version.
2. The way the function interacts with the Fish shell and the Oh-My-Fish plugin might be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the subprocess command used to retrieve the Fish shell version triggering a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish uses the command `thefuck -v`. The function `info` directly runs a command that interacts with the Fish shell, which leads to the recursive loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the Fish shell version is retrieved in a way that does not trigger a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used. One approach could be to find an alternative way to get the Fish shell version without directly interacting with the shell.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = 'Unknown'
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
        version_lines = version_output.splitlines()
        for line in version_lines:
            if line.startswith('fish'):
                version = line.split()[-1]
                break
    except:
        pass
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using a more direct command `['fish', '-v']` to get the Fish shell version. Then, we parse the output to find the line starting with 'fish' and extract the version from that line. This approach avoids triggering a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used.
