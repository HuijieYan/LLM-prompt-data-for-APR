### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, it is causing a recursive loop issue when used in certain scenarios, such as with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Identify Error Locations:
The error in the buggy function lies in the fact that it is triggering a recursive loop when the `fish` command is executed with `-c` option to fetch the version of the Fish shell.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when the `thefuck` plugin is triggered using the `-v` option, it calls the `info()` function which uses the `Popen` function to execute a command within Fish shell. This execution triggers a recursive loop because Fish shell is being called within Fish shell recursively.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can modify the `info()` function to directly return a static string instead of executing a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function that avoids the recursive loop issue:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return 'Fish Shell'
```

By returning a static string `'Fish Shell'` directly from the `info()` function, we prevent the recursive loop issue when the `thefuck` plugin is triggered with the `-v` option. This change resolves the problem described in the GitHub issue.
