### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the Fish shell implementation in the `thefuck` tool. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (`Fish Shell`). However, it uses the `thefuck -v` command, which triggers a recursive loop when used in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Error locations:
1. Using `thefuck -v` command in the `Popen` call.
2. Reading the output from the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which can lead to blocking issues.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the usage of `thefuck -v` command in the `Popen` call in the `info` function. This command triggers a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing the shell initialization to hang.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid using the `thefuck -v` command in the `Popen` call. Instead, we can directly retrieve the Fish shell version without triggering the recursive loop. Additionally, we should use non-blocking read operations to prevent any hanging issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Fish Shell (version not available)"
```

In the corrected version:
- We replaced the `thefuck -v` command with just `fish -v` to directly get the Fish shell version.
- We used `proc.communicate()[0]` for non-blocking read operation.
- Added exception handling to handle any errors that might occur during getting the shell version.

This corrected version should prevent the hanging issue caused by the `thefuck -v` command and provide the correct version of the Fish shell without triggering a recursive loop.
