### Analysis:
The buggy function `info(self)` in the `fish.py` file is calling `thefuck -v` to get the version of the Fish shell. However, this triggers a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing the shell initialization to hang.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue lies in the use of `thefuck -v` within the `info(self)` function, leading to a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because calling `thefuck -v` within the `info(self)` function triggers initialization steps that lead to a recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish plugin. This recursive loop causes the hanging of the Fish shell initialization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid calling `thefuck -v` within the `info(self)` function. Instead, we can directly specify the name and version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return u'Fish Shell'  # Updated to directly specify the name without calling thefuck -v
```

By directly specifying the name of the shell in the `info(self)` function without triggering the recursive loop, we resolve the hanging issue caused by using Oh-My-Fish plugin with the `thefuck` command.
