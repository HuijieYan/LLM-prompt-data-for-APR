### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a subprocess command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION''`. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that this command causes a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, resulting in a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` may be causing the hang due to the way it interacts with the Fish Shell.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` and decoding it without handling potential reading issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The recursive loop is likely caused by the subprocess command triggering the Oh-My-Fish plugin to regenerate functions repeatedly, leading to a hang during initialization. The function `info` does not account for this scenario, leading to the bug reported on GitHub.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative approach to retrieve the Fish Shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This can be achieved by using a more direct method to fetch the shell version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = 'Unknown'
    try:
        # Execute 'fish --version' command to get the Fish Shell version directly
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any potential exceptions
        version = 'Unknown'

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version of the `info` function:
- We are using the `'fish --version'` command to directly retrieve the Fish Shell version without triggering any recursive loops.
- An exception handling block has been added to handle any potential errors that might occur during the version retrieval process.
- The function now returns `'Fish Shell Unknown'` if the version retrieval fails or encounters an error.

By using this corrected version, we have addressed the bug reported on the GitHub issue by avoiding the recursive loop that causes the hang during Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
