### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is responsible for retrieving the version of the Fish Shell being used. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses `thefuck -v`, it triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function which causes hangs during Fish Shell initialization.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error location in the `info` function is the usage of `proc.stdout.read()` without properly handling the reading and closing of the process output.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub Issue information:

The bug is caused by the fact that the `Fish.info` function does not correctly handle the reading of the process output from the `Popen` command. This leads to a recursive loop when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses `thefuck -v`, which in turn triggers the `info` function to determine the shell version. This recursive behavior causes the initialization to hang.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to update the way in which the process output is read and ensure that the process is closed properly after reading the output. Additionally, we should handle the case where the process fails to execute the command properly.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate()` to read the output of the process and ensure that it is handled correctly.
- We properly handle any exceptions that might occur during the process execution.
- We return an error message if there is any issue retrieving the Fish Shell version.
