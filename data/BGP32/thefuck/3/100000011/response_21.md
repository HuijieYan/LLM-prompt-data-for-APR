### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running a command using `Popen`. The bug likely causes the function to hang when called with the `-v` argument due to the recursive loop triggered by the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` without properly handling the process's output or potential errors.
2. The function might not be handling the case where `FISH_VERSION` is not defined or the command fails to execute.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the Oh-My-Fish plugin when using the `thefuck -v` command to regenerate functions. The function `info` in `fish.py` inadvertently hangs the system while trying to fetch the Fish Shell version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function in `fish.py` properly handles the case when it's called with the `-v` argument to prevent the recursive loop. Additionally, error handling should also be implemented to cover scenarios where the command execution fails.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # Using PIPE for both stdout and stderr
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()  # Retrieve stdout and stderr from the process
    if proc.returncode != 0:  # Check if the process execution failed
        return "Error: Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version"

    # Decode stdout and handle errors
    try:
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        return "Error: Unable to decode Fish Shell version"

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `info` function now properly handles errors, including command execution failures and decoding issues. By using `PIPE` for both `stdout` and `stderr` and checking the return code of the process, the recursive loop issue caused by the Oh-My-Fish plugin should be resolved.
