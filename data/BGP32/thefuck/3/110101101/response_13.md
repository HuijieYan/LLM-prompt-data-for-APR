### Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the command used to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the expected output format (`fish, version 3.5.9\n`). This causes the function to fail the test.

### Bug
The bug lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not match the expected output format `fish, version 3.5.9\n`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to match the expected output format.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # Fixed info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8')
        version = output.strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
