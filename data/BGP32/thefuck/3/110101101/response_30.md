### Analysis
1. The `info` function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The failing test provides the stdout content `fish, version 3.5.9\n`, but the function is expecting just the version number without the extra text.
3. The function is incorrectly processing the stdout content to extract the version number.
4. A fix is needed to correctly parse the version number from the stdout content.

### Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

        # Extract version number
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '').rstrip('\n')

        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By extracting the version number correctly from the stdout content and removing any extra text, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
