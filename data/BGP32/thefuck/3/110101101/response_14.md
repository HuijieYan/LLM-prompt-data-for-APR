### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then extracting the version from the output. However, the test is expecting the version to be extracted from the output of `fish --version`, which is different from the command used in the function.

### Bug explanation
The bug exists because the function is not running the correct command (`fish --version`) to retrieve the version information. As a result, the extracted version does not match the expected version in the test.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` in order to align it with the expected output in the test.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version from the output
        version = version.split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the function will now correctly extract the Fish shell version from `fish --version`, ensuring it aligns with the expected output in the test.
