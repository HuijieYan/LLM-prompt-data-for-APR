### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. However, the command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test is expecting the version to be obtained by running `fish --version`. This mismatch in commands is causing the test to fail.

### Bug
The bug is in the command being executed to get the Fish shell version. The command should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Fix
Modify the command being executed in the `info` function to `fish --version` to correctly obtain the Fish shell version.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By updating the command in the `Popen` call to `fish --version`, the function will correctly return the version of the Fish shell when called, passing the failing test.
