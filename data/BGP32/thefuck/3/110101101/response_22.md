The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to capture the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the expected version format is different (e.g., "fish, version 3.5.9\n"). This causes the test to fail when trying to assert the returned version.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command to get the version in the correct format. Also, we can modify the way we extract and format the version from the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version in the format required by the failing test. It should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
