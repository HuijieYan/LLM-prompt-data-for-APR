## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell.
2. The function is using the `Popen` function to run a command to get the Fish shell version.
3. The test is setting up the `Popen` mock object to return the version string, but the function is expecting it to read from the process output.
4. The bug is that the function is trying to read from the `stdout` directly, but it should be using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to get the output.
5. The expected output of the function should be the Fish shell version extracted from the output string.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function reads the process output. Instead of trying to read from `stdout` directly, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to get the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version should pass the failing test and return the expected output.
