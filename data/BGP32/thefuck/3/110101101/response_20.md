## Analysis
1. The `info` function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test is expecting the version to be extracted using `fish --version`.
2. The test case is mocking the output of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is not what the function is trying to extract.
3. The function is reading the output of the subprocess command and then formatting it as 'Fish Shell {version}', which does not match the expected output of the test case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed in the subprocess call to `fish --version` and then parse the version from the output correctly.

## Bug Fix
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[-1]  # extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By fixing the function as shown above, it correctly executes the command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell and then parses the version from the output to match the expected output in the failing test case.
