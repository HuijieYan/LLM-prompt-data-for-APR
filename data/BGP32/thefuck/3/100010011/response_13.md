### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
- The function is supposed to retrieve the version number of the Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but it is not extracting just the version number correctly.
- The GitHub issue suggests that there is a recursive loop trigger when using `thefuck -v` due to this buggy function.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `info` is not properly extracting just the version number from the command output, resulting in the unexpected string format.
- The recursive loop trigger mentioned in the GitHub issue may be related to this incorrect output causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the function to correctly extract just the version number from the output of the command.
- Ensure that the extracted version number is in the correct format `'Fish Shell x.y.z'`.
- Test the function with the provided test case to verify that it returns the expected output without causing any recursive loops.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the function correctly parses the version number from the output of the command and formats it as `'Fish Shell x.y.z'` as expected. This should resolve the failing test and prevent any recursive loop triggers mentioned in the GitHub issue.
