### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') does not match the actual version obtained from the process execution output ('Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'). The error message also suggests that the function is returning a version with extra unnecessary characters ('fish,').

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in how the version string is extracted from the process execution output in the `info` function. The extraction method does not properly handle the format of the version string provided.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect extraction of the version string from the process execution output. The version string extracted includes the unnecessary 'fish,' prefix because of how the data is being read and decoded.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The strategy to fix the bug involves modifying how the version string is extracted from the process output. Specifically, the extraction process should be adjusted to remove the unwanted 'fish,' prefix and only include the version number in the output.

### Buggy Function (Fixed Version):
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number from the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Explanation:
- In the fixed version of the function, the extracted version string is processed to remove the 'fish,' prefix and any unnecessary whitespace. This modification ensures that only the version number is included in the output, resolving the mismatch between the expected and actual versions.

### Conclusion:
- The bug in the `info` function has been fixed by properly extracting and processing the version string from the process output. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function returns the correct version information.
