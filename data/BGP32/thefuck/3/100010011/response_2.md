### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file tries to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. 
2. The error message from the failing test shows that the version obtained from the command (`b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`) is not formatted correctly for comparison.
3. The issue on GitHub points out that running `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop because of the way the version information is obtained.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the version information retrieved from the command includes unwanted characters (`b'` at the beginning, `\n'` at the end) along with the actual version string. This results in the comparison failure between the expected formatted version and the obtained version.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code in the `info` function to properly extract and format the version string obtained from the command output before comparing it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we first strip the unnecessary characters from the obtained version string and then split it based on `,`. We then extract the second part of the split string (which is the actual version) and strip any extra spaces. This ensures that the version is properly extracted and formatted for comparison.
