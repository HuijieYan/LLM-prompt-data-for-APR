### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using a subprocess, but the extraction of the version is not done correctly. The failing test case indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect formatting of the version string.
2. Incorrect command used within the subprocess call.
3. Incorrect decoding or stripping of the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect way the function is extracting and formatting the Fish shell version from the subprocess output. The current implementation just returns the output of the command without proper formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly extract and format the Fish shell version from the subprocess output.
2. Ensure that unnecessary text in the output is removed and only the version number is included in the final formatted string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `version` is extracted correctly using `.split(', version ')` to get just the version number without the unnecessary text. This modification ensures that the formatted output matches the expected format `'Fish Shell X.X.X'`.

This correction should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version extraction.
