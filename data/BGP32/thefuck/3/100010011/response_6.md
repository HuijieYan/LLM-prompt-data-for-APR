### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is trying to get the version of the Fish shell, but it is not parsing the correct output. The error message from the failing test indicates that the version retrieved includes extra information like `'fish, version'` which should not be there.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the line where the output is being read and processed into the `version` variable:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect parsing of the version output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The output contains the text `'fish, version'` which is not needed and causes the mismatch in the test. The bug is related to the incorrect processing of the standard output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the output parsing needs to be adjusted to extract only the version number from the output without the unnecessary string `'fish, version'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number by splitting the output on commas
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and return it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected in the test.
