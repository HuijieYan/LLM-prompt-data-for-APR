## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call to `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the issue arises because the output obtained from this subprocess contains extra text "fish, version" which is not needed when constructing the return value.

## Potential Error:
The error occurs due to the comparison between the actual value returned by the `info` function (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`) and the expected value (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`), leading to the AssertionError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the actual output to include the extra text "fish, version" which is not intended. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail and leading to the reported AssertionError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `info` function to parse and extract only the version number without the unwanted extra text before constructing the return value.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_with_text = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number without the text "fish, version"
    version = version_with_text.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output obtained from the subprocess on whitespace and selecting the last element (which is the version number), we ensure that only the version number is used in constructing the return value. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
