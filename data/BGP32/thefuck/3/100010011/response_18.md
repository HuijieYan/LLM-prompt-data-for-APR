### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `info` in the `fish.py` file is not correctly extracting the version of Fish Shell. The test is expecting the version number to be extracted from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the function is not handling it properly. This is causing the assertion error in the test.

### Potential Error Location:
The error may be in the way the `stdout` is being read from the `Popen` process or in the formatting of the returned version string.

### Bug Cause:
The `info` function is not correctly extracting the version string from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The output is expected to be in the form "fish, version x.y.z", but the function is not processing it properly to extract just the version number.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to correctly parse the output of the command to extract the version number.
2. Update the string formatting to include the extracted version number in the correct format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string at ", version " and taking the second part, we can extract just the version number. This corrected version should now properly extract and format the Fish Shell version, resolving the issue in the failing test.
