1. Analyzing the buggy function and error message:
- The buggy function, `info`, is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command and capturing the output.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning the version string incorrectly, which leads to the assertion error in the test case.
- The failing test case is related to the incorrect comparison between the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') and the obtained version ('fish, version 3.5.9').

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The way the version string is extracted from the output of the command executed using `Popen`.
- The formatting of the final output string with the version.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the improper handling of the output obtained from the command execution.
- The obtained version string includes additional characters 'fish, version' which is not required in the final output string.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the way the version string is extracted from the command output to remove the unnecessary characters.
- Update the formatting of the final output string to correctly represent the Fish Shell version.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Parsing the version number from the output string
    version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove the unnecessary prefix
    
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the way the version number is extracted and formatted in the output string, the corrected function should pass the failing test and address the reported GitHub issue related to the recursive loop in Fish Shell initialization with TheFuck plugin.
