### Analysis:
The error message shows that the `info()` method in the `Fish` class is returning the incorrect version information. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This indicates that there is an issue with extracting the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `info()` method is triggering a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used. This suggests that the version extraction method is incorrect, causing unexpected behavior in the plugin.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly parsing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The function is currently returning the entire output including the text `'fish, version'` instead of just the version number.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to parse only the version number from the output.
2. Update the return statement to include the correct version format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting version number
    return 'Fish Shell ' + version_number
``` 

By splitting the `version_output` on the comma and extracting the second part (`version_number`), we ensure that only the version number is returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
