### Analyzing the buggy function and error message:

The buggy function `info(self)` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The issue arises from the fact that the output of this command includes the text `fish, version` along with the actual version number. This discrepancy causes the comparison in the test case to fail.

The error message from the failing test clearly shows the mismatch between the expected output (`Fish Shell 3.5.9`) and the actual output (`Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`). This error is due to the extra text `fish, version` included in the output.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error location in the `info(self)` function is the line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
This line reads the output of the command and decodes it as a UTF-8 string and then strips any leading or trailing whitespaces. However, it does not handle the case where the output contains additional text like `fish, version`.

### Cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug is that the `info(self)` function does not correctly extract only the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This causes the extracted version to include unnecessary text, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info(self)` function to correctly extract only the version number from the output of the command by removing the unnecessary text `fish, version`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if 'fish, version' in output:
        version = output.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    else:
        version = output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By checking if the output contains the string `fish, version` and then removing it if present, we can ensure that the extracted version is clean and matches the expected format. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
