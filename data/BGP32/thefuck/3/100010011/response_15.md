### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `info()` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The error message is indicating that the expected output of the function and the actual output do not match. The test is expecting `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while receiving `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests that there is a recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command. This recursion is possibly due to the incorrect behavior of the `info()` function, which is expected to return the version in a specific format.

### Error Location

The error in the function lies in how the version information is extracted from the output of the command. The function is not correctly parsing the version, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual values.

### Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is that the function is simply returning the output of the `Popen` process without processing it correctly to extract the version number only. This leads to the incorrect format in the returned string, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info()` function to properly extract and process the version information from the command output. We should only include the version number in the final string that is returned by the function to match the expected format.

### Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
    try:
        version_output = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
    except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
        return 'Fish Shell Unknown'  # Handle potential decoding or parsing errors
```

In the corrected version, we read the output of the `Popen` process, decode it to a UTF-8 encoded string, extract the version number from it by splitting on commas and taking the second part, and then format it correctly to match the expected output.

This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the `info()` function returns the version number in the correct format.
