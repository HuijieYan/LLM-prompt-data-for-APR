### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command with `Popen`. The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the expected output format is incorrect.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect parsing of the output from the command.
2. Formatting issue when constructing the return statement.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function incorrectly parsing the output of the command to retrieve the Fish shell version. It is currently including the text "fish, version" in the version string, which is not expected. This leads to a mismatch in the assertion test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the parsing logic to correctly extract only the version number from the command output.
2. Ensure that the constructed return statement follows the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the function

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Parse only the version number from the output
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the function to correctly parse the version number from the command output and adjusting the formatting of the return statement, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
