### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing its output. However, the output is not being parsed correctly, resulting in an incorrect version string.
2. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
3. The bug is causing a failure in the test case due to the mismatch in the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the output of the subprocess to extract the version number and format it properly.
5. The bug is related to the incorrect parsing of the version output from the subprocess.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the subprocess by ',' and extracting the second part which contains the version number, we can fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct version string.
