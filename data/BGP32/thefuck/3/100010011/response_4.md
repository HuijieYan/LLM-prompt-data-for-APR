### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the function `info()` is not correctly extracting and formatting the version number due to the usage of `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in the Popen call.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the way the `echo $FISH_VERSION` output is being processed in the function `info()` before formatting it with `'Fish Shell {}'`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is in the way the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being read and processed. The `Popen` call is not capturing the correct output, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual version number, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the version number extracted from the shell command output is correctly formatted before returning it with `'Fish Shell {}'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    if 'version' in version:
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation:
- Changed `proc.stdout.read()` to `proc.communicate()[0]` to correctly read the output of the shell command.
- Added a check to verify if the word 'version' is present in the output and split the string to extract the version number accordingly.
- Formatted the extracted version number correctly before returning it with `'Fish Shell {}'`.

This corrected version should now properly extract and format the Fish Shell version, resolving the issue with the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
