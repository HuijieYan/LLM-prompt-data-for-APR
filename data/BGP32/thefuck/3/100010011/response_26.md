### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the expected output of the `shell.info()` function is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. The issue in GitHub mentions that calling `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to a problem in the `Fish.info()` function. 

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the version number is extracted from the command output. The output includes the text `'fish, version'` which is not required in the final output. The `decode('utf-8')` does not correctly transform the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version number is extracted from the command output. We should extract only the version number without any additional text.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `Fish.info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `readline()` instead of `read()`, we read one line of output at a time. Then, we split the line by spaces and extract the last element, which is the version number.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct version number without additional text.
