### Analysis:
The buggy function `info()` in the `fish.py` shell file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. The issue arises from the way the version is extracted from the command output, leading to a mismatch in the expected output of the test case.

The error message indicates that the extracted version includes additional text "fish, version" which causes the assertion error.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the output of the `Popen` command is read and decoded.
2. The formatting of the version string before returning it.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is directly returning the entire output without parsing and extracting just the version number. This results in the additional text "fish, version" being included in the version string, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number without the extra text and then return the correctly formatted version string.

### Correction: Fixed Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract only the version number
    version_number = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By splitting the `version_output` string based on the comma separator and extracting the second element (version number), we can ensure that only the version number is returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in GitHub.
