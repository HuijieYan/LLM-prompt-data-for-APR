## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` module is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the test is expecting the function to return the version number in a specific format, and the output is slightly different than the expected format.

The issue mentioned in GitHub indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` in combination with Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function.

## Identified Bug:
- The output format of the version number extracted from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not match the expected format.
- The incorrect output is causing the test to fail and triggering the GitHub issue due to the recursive loop.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the parsing of the version number from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command to match the expected format.
- Update the `info` function to ensure that it returns the version number in the correct format to resolve the failing test and prevent the recursive loop issue mentioned in GitHub.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number without additional text
    version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this corrected version, the function `info` will extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command correctly and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the failing test and prevent the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
