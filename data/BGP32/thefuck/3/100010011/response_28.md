### Analysis
- The buggy function `info(self)` is trying to extract the version of Fish Shell by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the version number to return the name and version of the current shell.
- The error message indicates an assertion failure where the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
- The GitHub issue suggests that triggering `thefuck -v` command is causing a recursive loop due to this buggy function.

### Bug Cause
The bug is occurring because the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is outputting a string containing additional information (`fish, version`) which is not expected by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function extracts the version information from the output of the command. We should trim the additional information and extract just the version number before formatting it.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Function Explanation
1. Modified the code to read the output of the command into a variable `output`.
2. Extracted just the version number by splitting the `output` string using space and selecting the last element which contains the version number.
3. Formatted the version number into the desired output format.
4. Returned the version string with the correct formatting.

By applying these changes, the function now correctly extracts and formats the version number of Fish Shell using the output of the command, addressing the bug and passing the failing test.
