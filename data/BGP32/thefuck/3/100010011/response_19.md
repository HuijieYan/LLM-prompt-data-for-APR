### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the GitHub issue:
- The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess command.
- The failing test in `test_info` sets up a mock for the subprocess `Popen` object to return a specific version string, but the actual formatted output from the `info` function differs from the expected output.
- The GitHub issue highlights that using the `thefuck -v` command in the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the implementation of `Fish.info()`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Reading the output from the `Popen` process may not be capturing the correct version string.
2. Formatting of the output when constructing the shell information string may be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is reading the version output incorrectly and failing to format it properly for the expected output.
- This mismatch causes the failing test and also leads to a recursive loop as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the version string is read correctly from the `Popen` process output.
2. Adjust the formatting of the version string when constructing the shell information to match the expected output.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number from the original output
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By extracting only the version number from the output and using it in the formatted output, we can correct the bug and ensure that the version information is correctly displayed.
