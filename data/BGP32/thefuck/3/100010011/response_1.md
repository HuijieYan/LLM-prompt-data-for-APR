### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then extracting the version from the output.
- The error message indicates that the expected version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` is slightly different from the actual version retrieved from the command output `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
- The GitHub issue mentions that using `thefuck -v` in Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to the `info` function, which is inaccurate.

### Error Cause:
- The error is caused by the incorrect format of the version string obtained from the command output.
- The command output includes extra text `'fish, version'` which is not needed and causes the mismatch in the expected and actual version strings.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of extracting the Fish shell version from the command output.
- We should remove the unnecessary text `'fish, version'` from the output and only extract the version number.
- Then, we should format the extracted version number in the correct format `'Fish Shell x.x.x'` before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract the version number from the command output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    
    # Format the version number in the correct format
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the `info` function as shown above, we extract only the version number after removing the unnecessary text. This corrected version should now properly extract the Fish shell version and format it correctly for returning.
