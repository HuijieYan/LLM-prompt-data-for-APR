### Analysis:
The function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the current Fish shell. However, the function is not correctly fetching and formatting the version information, leading to a mismatch in the expected output compared to the actual output. The error message during the failing test indicates that the version is not being correctly parsed and formatted.

The GitHub issue states that the use of the `-v` option in the `thefuck` plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function, which suggests there is a problem with how version information is retrieved from the shell.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the version information is being extracted from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` is being obtained, but the string manipulation to extract just the version number is not correct. This results in the incorrect comparison in the test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the version number from the output obtained by the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. We can use string manipulation functions to extract the version number correctly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract the version number part from the output
    version_start = version_output.find('version') + len('version')
    version = version_output[version_start:].strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract and format the version number from the shell output, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
