### Analysis:
The `info` method in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The issue arises from the way the version information is being extracted from the subprocess output. The test case is failing because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` while the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the version is extracted from the output of the subprocess.
2. The formatting of the final return string.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` method extracting the version information from the subprocess output without properly parsing it. When the subprocess command is executed, the output includes extra text such as `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`. This extra text is causing the assertion failure in the test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `info` method needs to properly extract only the version number from the subprocess output and then format the final return string accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output on the ',' character and taking the last part, we can extract just the version number and format the final string as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
