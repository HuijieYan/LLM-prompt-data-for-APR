### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` and capturing the output. However, the output includes unnecessary text such as `fish, version` before the actual version number. This causes the assertion in the test to fail because the expected output does not match the actual output due to the extra text.

The `stdout.read()` method returns the entire output, including the unnecessary text, which leads to the discrepancy.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by including the `fish, version` text in the output when retrieving the Fish shell version. This additional text interferes with the expected output in the test, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output obtained from the command. One way to achieve this is by splitting the output based on commas and extracting the last part, which should be the version number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output based on commas and taking the last part, we can ensure that only the version number is extracted and returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
