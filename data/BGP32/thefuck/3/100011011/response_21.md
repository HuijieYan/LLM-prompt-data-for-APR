### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through a subprocess. However, the issue arises from the fact that the output of the command includes extra text like `'fish, version'`. This extra text causes the assertion error in the failing test.

The provided runtime values show that the `version` variable contains the extra text `'fish, version'` along with the version number, leading to the mismatch in the comparison during the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `info` is not correctly parsing the output of the command to extract just the version number. This causes the returned string to include the unnecessary text `'fish, version'`, resulting in a failed assertion in the test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract only the version number from the output of the command and format the return string accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number without 'fish, version' text
    version_number = version.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

By splitting the `version` string and selecting the last element, we ensure that only the version number without the extra text is included in the return value. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
