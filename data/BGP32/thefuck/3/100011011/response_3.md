### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` is designed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command.
- The error message indicates that the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` does not match the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
- The mock objects used for `Popen` and its attributes are not returning the correct values during testing.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function is not correctly handling the output obtained from the `Popen` command. It is directly using the result without proper parsing.
- The test case is mocking the subprocess result to include the prefix `'fish, version'`, which is not accounted for in the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to properly parse the output from the `Popen` command to extract only the version number.
- Update the test case to reflect the expected format of the output.

### Fixed Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the line `version = version.split(',')[1].strip()` before the return statement, we extract the version number from the output.

### Updated Test:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
```

The updated test now accounts for the expected version number after the correction in the `info` function.
