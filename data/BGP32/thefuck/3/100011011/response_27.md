### Analysis:
The buggy function `info(self)` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess using `Popen` and capturing the output. However, the issue arises from the fact that the returned version string includes additional information that is not expected, causing the assertion error.

The input provided to `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which should return the version of the Fish shell installed. The output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` is captured and decoded as a string `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. The function tries to format this string as `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`, resulting in `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, so the bug lies in the formatting of the version string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the assertion error because the function `info` formats the version string with additional text. This additional text is not expected, leading to a mismatch in the assertion check.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is formatted to remove the extra text and only keep the version number. We can achieve this by splitting the version string based on a delimiter (`,` in this case) and extracting the version number part.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number from the version string
    version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip().split(' ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
``` 

### Updated Runtime Values:
After applying the corrected code, when the function is called with the provided input values, it will extract the version number correctly and return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected. This will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
