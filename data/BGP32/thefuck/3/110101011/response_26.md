## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the test is expecting the version to be extracted from `fish --version` command instead.
2. The `Popen` call in the `info` function is incorrect and the way it retrieves the shell version is different from what the test expects.
3. The test case is setting up the `Popen` mock to return the output of `fish --version`, but the `info` function is actually executing `echo $FISH_VERSION`, leading to a mismatch in the expected version value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Popen` call in the `info` function to execute `fish --version` command.

## Bug Fix
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

With this fix, the `info` function now correctly retrieves the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command and parses the version number from the output. This corrected version should resolve the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
