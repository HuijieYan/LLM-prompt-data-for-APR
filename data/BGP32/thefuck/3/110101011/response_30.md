## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of Fish shell, however, the test is asserting that the command being run is `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the command being executed is causing the test to fail. Additionally, the test sets the return value of `Popen` to be `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function expects only the version number without the prefix `'fish, version '`. 

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the command being executed by the function and the one expected by the test. The function is also not handling the prefix `'fish, version '` correctly before extracting the version number.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being run in the `Popen` call to `'fish --version'` to match the expectation of the test. Additionally, we need to modify the parsing of the version number from the output to handle the prefix `'fish, version '` correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

        # Extract version number
        version = output.replace('fish, version ', '').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `info()` function runs the command `fish --version` to extract the version number correctly, and then formats the output string to match the test's expectation.
