### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command being run by Popen might not be configured correctly, leading to incorrect output.
2. Reading the stdout of the process could result in an incorrect version value being captured.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the command being run by Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is incorrect and should be changed to `fish --version` to get the actual version of the Fish shell.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command being executed by Popen to `fish --version` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.
2. Modify the way the stdout is read from the process to ensure the correct version is captured.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').replace('fish, version ', '').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command `fish --version` is used to fetch the Fish shell version correctly. Additionally, the way the stdout is read has been modified to ensure the version is captured accurately.

This correction should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
