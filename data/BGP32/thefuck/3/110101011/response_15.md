Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function within the `Fish` class is likely due to reading the version output incorrectly from the process stdout. The `stdout.read()` method is causing the issue because it is being read as a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the process. This results in the version string not being correctly retrieved, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to correct how the output from `stdout.read()` is processed and returned as the version of the Fish shell. We can modify the function to correctly handle the stdout output from the process.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By splitting the `version` string and extracting the last element (which is assumed to be the version number), we ensure that the correct version number is returned. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.

Once this correction is in place, the test case should no longer fail when checking for the version of the Fish shell.

Please test the corrected version with the provided failing test to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed.
