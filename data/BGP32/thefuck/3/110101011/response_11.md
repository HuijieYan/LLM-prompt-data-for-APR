The issue in the buggy function `Fish.info` arises from the fact that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used to retrieve the version of Fish shell, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`. This inconsistency leads to the test failing and the plugin hanging during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to match what the test is expecting.

Here is the corrected version of the function `Fish.info`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the correct version information is retrieved, allowing the test to pass and resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
