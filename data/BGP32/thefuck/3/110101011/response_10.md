The bug in the `info` function is caused by using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` to get the Fish shell version. This discrepancy in the command used results in the function not properly extracting the version information and failing the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command passed to Popen to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly extract the version information using `fish --version`, and the test case provided will pass successfully.
