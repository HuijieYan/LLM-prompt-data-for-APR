### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command used in Popen might not be correct for retrieving the Fish version.
2. Reading the output from the process might not be handled correctly.
3. The format of the version string might not match the expected format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish version. Additionally, parsing the output of the process might not be done correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct command to get the Fish version.
2. Ensure proper handling of reading the output of the process.
3. Verify that the version string is extracted and formatted correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2].replace('\n', ''))
```

In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish version is updated, and the version string is extracted correctly by splitting and formatting it before returning. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
