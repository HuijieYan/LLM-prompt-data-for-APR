## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.
2. The test is setting the side effect for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` with the value `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is reading the output directly from `proc.stdout`, not from `proc.stdout.read()`.
3. This discrepancy in the expected shell command and the way version output is read is causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the shell command in the `Popen` call to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Update the way the version output is retrieved, making sure it corresponds to the expected value in the test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, with the corrected version, the function should properly retrieve the Fish shell version using the correct command `fish --version` and pass the failing test.
