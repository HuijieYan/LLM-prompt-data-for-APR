### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then format it to return a string representing the Fish Shell along with its version.
2. The test case is mocking the `Popen` object's `stdout.read` to return the version string `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.
3. The function is trying to decode the output from `stdout` but is not reading the output correctly, leading to an incorrect version.
4. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problem with the tool hanging due to a recursive loop, which is likely caused by this decoding issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding of the output read from `proc.stdout`. This results in an incorrect version string being returned by the `info()` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, directly decode the output when reading from `stdout`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, the output will be correctly decoded, and the correct version string will be returned by the `info()` function.
