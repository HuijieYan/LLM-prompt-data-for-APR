## Identified Bugs:
1. In the `info` function of the `Fish` class, the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is used to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, in the test function, the expected command is `['fish', '--version']`. This mismatch causes the `Popen.call_args[0][0]` assertion to fail.
2. The stdout read method `proc.stdout.read()` is mocked in the test function but not properly configured to return the desired version string.

## Bug Cause:
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is using a different shell command to retrieve the version compared to what the test function is expecting. This leads to a mismatch between the expected version string and the actual version string, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Change the command in the `info` function from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the test expectations.
2. Configure the mock `proc.stdout.read.side_effect` in the test function to return the expected version string `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):




    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
    
```

The corrected version has addressed the issues by using the correct shell command to retrieve the version and configuring the test function to return the expected version string.
