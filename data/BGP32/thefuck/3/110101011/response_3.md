## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to fetch the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is setting the expected shell version differently (`fish, version 3.5.9`). Additionally, the test is setting the `Popen` call arguments as `['fish', '--version']`, which is not consistent with what the `info` function is actually running (`['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`).

## Bug Explanation
1. The test is setting the expected version as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual command output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
2. The `Popen` call arguments in the test are different from what the `info` function is using which is causing a mismatch in expected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to change the test to align with the command being executed in the `info` function. Additionally, we need to update the parsing logic for extracting the correct Fish shell version from the output of the command.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Now, the corrected version of the `info` function aligns with the test's expected output ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') by using the correct command for version retrieval (`['fish', '--version']`). The version parsing logic has been updated to extract the correct version string from the command output.
