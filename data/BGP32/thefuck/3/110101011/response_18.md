### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting the command `fish --version`.
2. The test is mocking the command output to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is different from what the function is trying to retrieve.
3. The test fails because the function is not using the correct command to get the shell version.
4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After making this correction, the `info` function should be able to fetch the Fish shell version correctly, resolving the failing test case.
