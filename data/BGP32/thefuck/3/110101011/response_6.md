### Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of Fish shell by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
2. The test function is mocking the output of the command `fish --version`, but the function is actually using `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
3. The `Popen` call in the `info` function needs to run `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to match the test case.
4. The current implementation is causing a recursive loop issue as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command executed in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command in the test case (`fish --version`). This causes the test to fail and triggers a recursive loop issue as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed in the `Popen` call of the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']`. This will align the actual shell version retrieval with the test case's expectation and prevent the recursive loop issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function in the `Fish` class will now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using `fish --version`, matching the test case expectations and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
