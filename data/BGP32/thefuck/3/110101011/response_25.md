### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. The expected version output is then formatted into a string with the prefix 'Fish Shell'.
2. The failing test `test_info` is mocking the `Popen` function to return a specific version output which the `info` function should format correctly.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` in Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to this function, which implies there might be a problem with the command being executed to get the Fish shell version.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect command being executed in the `info` function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version. Instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the correct command should be `fish --version`.

### Bug Fix:
Fix the command being executed in the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

After implementing this change, the `info` function should correctly retrieve the Fish shell version, fix the bug, and pass the failing test.
