### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command. 
2. The issue seems to be with the command being executed as it does not match the expected output of the failing test.
3. The failing test expects the output `'fish, version 3.5.9'` while the function is attempting to extract the version from the environment variable `$FISH_VERSION`.
4. To fix this issue, the command executed by Popen needs to be changed to retrieve the version information directly.
5. The failing test is related to the GitHub issue stating the problem with the usage of the `thefuck -v` command in Fish Shell.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the command executed by `Popen` to directly fetch the Fish Shell version information.
- Update the function to extract the version information accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version directly runs `fish --version` to fetch the version information of the Fish Shell, resolving the issue.
