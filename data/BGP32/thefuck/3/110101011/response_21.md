### Error Locations:
1. In the `info` function, the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version, but the expected command should be `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The test function expects the call to `Popen` with `['fish', '--version']`, but the actual call is made with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. The decoding function for the stdout data might lead to incorrect results if the encoding is not as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The current implementation of the `info` function in the `Fish` class is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. This results in incorrect output compared to what is expected by the test function. The incorrect command leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values, causing the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command in the `info` function from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Modify the test function to expect the correct command `['fish', '--version']` for the `Popen` call.
3. Ensure correct decoding of the stdout data to obtain the version information accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now correctly return the Fish shell version information and pass the failing test specified.
