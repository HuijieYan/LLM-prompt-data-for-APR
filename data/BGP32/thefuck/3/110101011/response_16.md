### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` but the command used does not match the one expected by the test.
2. The test is expecting the shell version to be obtained by running `fish --version` but the function is actually running `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This mismatch results in the test failing.
3. The `Popen` call in the function is not accurate and does not match what the test is mocking, leading to the incorrect version being fetched from the shell.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the command used to fetch the Fish shell version in the function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the command expected by the test (`fish --version`). This mismatch causes the test to fail as the function returns the incorrect version of the shell due to the wrong command being executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `Popen` call in the `info` function to run the command `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Update the test mock to reflect the correct command being executed within the function.
3. Ensure that the function returns the version of the Fish shell in the required format to pass the test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making the above correction, the function now runs the correct command to obtain the version of the Fish shell, which aligns with the expectations of the failing test. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
