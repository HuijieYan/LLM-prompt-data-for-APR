## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the expected output in the failing test (`fish, version 3.5.9`).
2. The failing test is setting the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to a specific value, but the function is not reading the output correctly.
3. The `Popen` call in the function is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`, which results in an incorrect version output.
4. To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be updated to use `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected output from the failing test.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By updating the `Popen` call to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, allowing it to pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
