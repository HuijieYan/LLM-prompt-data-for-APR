### Potential Error Locations
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the version may be incorrect.
2. The decoding and stripping of the version string might not be working as expected.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version in the `info` function. This results in the wrong version string that fails the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the command passed to Popen to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Update the decoding and stripping of the version string to ensure the correct version is obtained.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `['fish', '--version']` and modifying the decoding logic to extract the version correctly, the fixed function should now return the accurate version string. This correction addresses the root cause of the failure in the test case provided.
