## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of Fish Shell by running a command in the shell. However, the output of the command is not properly handled, resulting in an incorrect version string.
   
2. The bug likely occurs when trying to extract and format the version from the output of the command run by `Popen`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `strip()` method is not removing all leading and trailing whitespaces from the output, resulting in extra characters being included in the version string. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the failing test.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version string extracted from the output is cleaned properly before formatting it into the final string. One approach is to split the output by commas to remove unwanted characters.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()  # Splitting by commas and strip again
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command by commas and then stripping the version string again, we ensure that any leading or trailing whitespaces, as well as extra characters like 'fish, version', are removed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
