## Analysis
1. The buggy function, `info`, is responsible for retrieving the version of the Fish shell by executing a command through a subprocess. The issue stems from the `Popen` usage and the comparison of the extracted version with the expected output.
2. The expected version of the Fish shell is '3.5.9', but the extracted version includes extra characters and a prefix ('fish, version ').
3. This bug causes the comparison to fail, leading to the AssertionError in the test. The test case expects 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as the output, but the actual output includes 'fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version is extracted and formatted in the `info` function.

## Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove the prefix
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adding the line `version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')`, the extracted version will be cleaned by removing the 'fish, version ' prefix. This modification ensures the extracted version can be directly compared to the expected version in the test case, resolving the bug related to the incorrect output comparison.
