## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the decoding of the output and formatting into a string is causing an issue with comparison.
2. The error message indicates that the expected output is missing the literal "fish, version" which is causing the assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug is related to the way the version string is being retrieved and formatted in the function. The comparison is failing due to the presence of additional text in the output before the version number. The expected output should match the retrieved version without the additional text.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the decoding and formatting process to extract the version number correctly without unnecessary text.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `info` function within the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting just the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string by `,` and extracting the second part (which should be the version number) before formatting it correctly, the function now correctly retrieves and formats the Fish shell version. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
