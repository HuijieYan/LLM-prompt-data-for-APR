## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` and capturing the output. However, the issue seems to be in the way the output is being read and formatted.
2. The error message indicates that the output of the command contains the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the expected output should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly parsing and formatting the output of the command to extract only the version number.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly decode and format the output to get the desired version number using `decode('utf-8').strip()`.
5. We need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the command output and format the return value as `'Fish Shell version_number'`.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
```

By splitting the output around the comma and extracting the second part, we ensure that only the version number is included in the formatted return value. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
