Based on the error message from the failing test and the expected values and types of variables, the bug in the `Fish.info()` function is caused by not properly handling the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. It seems that the output includes the text "fish, version" in addition to just the version number, causing the mismatch in the expected and actual results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only the version number is extracted from the command output. We can modify the function to strip the unnecessary text before formatting the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `Fish.info()` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version will properly extract only the version number from the command output before formatting it as the shell's name and version. This fix should resolve the mismatch in the expected and actual results and pass the failing test.
