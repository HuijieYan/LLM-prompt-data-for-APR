## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess and capturing its output. However, the output is not trimmed correctly to extract only the version number, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output.
2. The error message indicates that the version string obtained includes unnecessary text, causing the assertion to fail.
3. The bug is caused by the failure to correctly extract the version number from the output of the subprocess command. The expected output should only contain the version number, whereas the actual output includes additional text.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code snippet that processes the output of the subprocess to extract only the version number.
5. The corrected version of the function will trim the unnecessary text from the obtained version string to match the expected format.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract only the version number from the obtained string
        if ',' in version:
            version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]  # Extract the version number
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the code to extract only the version number from the string obtained from the subprocess, the corrected function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
