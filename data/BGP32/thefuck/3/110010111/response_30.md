### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` might be causing the incorrect output.
2. The formatting of the returned string might not be handled correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the original code is caused by the incorrect processing of the output from the `Popen` command. The `shell.info()` function should return the version of the Fish shell, but due to the incorrect processing of the output, the returned string includes the unwanted text "fish, version" before the actual version number. This results in the assertion failure when comparing the expected output with the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to process the output of the `Popen` command correctly and extract only the version number without any additional text. We also need to ensure that the formatting of the returned string matches the expected output format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By splitting the version number from the output and ensuring that the returned string matches the expected format, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and provide the correct output.
