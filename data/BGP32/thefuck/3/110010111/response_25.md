## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is intended to get the version of Fish Shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command. The expected output is a string containing the version number.
2. The error occurs in the comparison of the actual output with the expected output. The actual output includes extra unnecessary information.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the command output in the `info` function. The version number extracted is not trimmed properly, leading to extra characters in the final output. This discrepancy causes the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only extract the version number from the command output without any unwanted characters.
5. We will modify the function to properly parse the version number and return the expected output.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract just the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of `proc.stdout.read()` based on whitespace and taking the last element as the version number, we can ensure that only the version number without extra characters is used in the return statement.
