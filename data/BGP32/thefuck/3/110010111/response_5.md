### Analysis:
- The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, the issue arises from the way the version is being extracted from the output of the command.
- The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current implementation includes unnecessary text (`fish, version`) in the version string.
- The cause of the bug lies in how the version string is extracted and formatted from the output of the command, resulting in an assertion error during testing.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is extracted from the output of the command. We should extract only the version number and then format it into the expected output format ('Fish Shell x.x.x').

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract only the version number from the output
        version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version output on the comma and selecting the second part, we can correctly extract the version number '3.5.9' from 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and return the expected output.
