## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the stdout. However, in the failing test, the mock setup is causing the function to return `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just the version number.
2. The current code doesn't handle the version output format correctly, which results in an incorrect assertion during the test.
3. The error message shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is due to the incorrect parsing of the version information from the stdout. The GitHub issue also confirms that there is a problem related to the Fish shell initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract only the version number from the output string.
5. Based on the analysis, we need to modify the function to correctly extract and format the version number.

## Code Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output
        version = version_output.split(", version ")[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In this corrected version, we read the output from `proc.stdout` and then extract only the version number by splitting the output on the `, version` string and taking the last part. This modification ensures that the function returns the correct version format for the Fish shell.
