## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell being used.
2. The bug occurs when the version string returned from the subprocess call includes the text "fish, version" instead of just the version number. This causes the assertion error in the test.
3. The expected output of the function should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' based on the assertion error message.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output of the subprocess call.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version number obtained from the subprocess call in the `info` function. The output of the subprocess call includes the text "fish, version" along with the actual version number which causes the assertion error.

## Fix Strategy
We need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output to only get the actual version number without any additional text.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Fixing the import statements
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

# The corrected version of the info function in the Fish class
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove 'fish, version ' from the version string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')` to remove the extra text before the version number extracted from the subprocess call's output, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
