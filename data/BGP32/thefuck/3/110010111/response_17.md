### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The issue arises because the output retrieved includes more information than just the version number. This extra information causes the assertion error when trying to compare this output to the expected version number.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Retrieving full output instead of just the version number.
2. Incorrect stripping of the output.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not correctly extracting only the version number from the shell output. The assertion fails because the obtained output includes more than just the version number, causing a mismatch with the expected value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract and return only the version number obtained from the command output. This can be achieved by parsing the output to extract the version number using string manipulation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number from the output
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].split('version')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract the version number from the shell output and return it for comparison, resolving the assertion error during the test execution.
