## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command through `Popen`.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected output (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) and the actual output (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
3. The `version` variable is not extracted correctly from the output of `proc.stdout.read()`.
4. The GitHub issue titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" points out the recursive loop issue due to this bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly extract the Fish Shell version from the output of `proc.stdout.read()`. We should ensure that only the version number, without any additional text, is captured.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By splitting the output based on whitespace and taking the last element, we extract only the version number from the command output. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
