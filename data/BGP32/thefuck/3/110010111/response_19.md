## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class, error message, expected values

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). The function makes use of the `Popen` class to execute a shell command, captures the output from the command, and extracts the version information from it.

The error message indicates that the actual output returned by the function includes the original string "fish, version" before the version number. This discrepancy leads to the assertion error since the expected output does not contain the extra "fish, version" string.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The way the version is extracted from the command output might be incorrect, resulting in the inclusion of the unnecessary "fish, version" text.
2. The formatting of the returned string might not be handling the version number appropriately.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect extraction of the version number from the command output. The function is not accounting for the "fish, version" prefix in the output, leading to the inclusion of that text in the final formatted string. This discrepancy causes the assertion error during testing.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version number is extracted from the command output. Specifically, we should trim the unnecessary text "fish, version" before including the version number in the final formatted string.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_info.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number only
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we first extract the complete version information as a string and then split it based on the comma character. This allows us to isolate and retrieve only the version number. Finally, the version number is used to format the return string, ensuring that it matches the expected format without any extra prefixes.
