### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output.
2. The error message indicates that the actual output of the command includes more text than just the version number.
3. The test case expects the function to return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that this bug causes a hang when using the `-v` flag with Oh-My-Fish plugin due to a recursive loop.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `info` not correctly filtering the output of the command to only extract the version number. This leads to unexpected extra text being included in the return value.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to process the command output correctly and extract only the version number.
2. Ensure that the function returns the expected format `'Fish Shell <version_number>'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    version_start = version_output.find('version') + len('version')
    version_end = version_output.find('\n')
    version = version_output[version_start:version_end].strip()
    
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

By modifying the function to correctly extract the version number from the output, the corrected version should pass the failing test and return the expected output format.
