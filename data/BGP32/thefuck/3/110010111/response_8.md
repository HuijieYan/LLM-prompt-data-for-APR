### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is meant to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess command to get the version information.
   
2. **Error**: The error occurs because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes the extra text `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug is caused by the fact that the code is reading the entire output `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, not just the version number itself.
   - This discrepancy results in the assertion error when comparing the expected output with the actual output.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Update the code to extract only the version number from the output obtained by the subprocess command.
   - This can be achieved by splitting the output string and selecting the portion containing the version number.
   - Ensure that the correct string manipulation is done to extract the version number without additional text.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By adjusting the code to extract the version number correctly from the output obtained, this corrected version should resolve the issue and provide the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as per the failing test.
