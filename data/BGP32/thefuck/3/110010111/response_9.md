Based on the provided information, let's analyze the buggy function and determine the cause of the bug:

1. **Relationship with Buggy Class**: The `info` function is a method of the `Fish` class, designed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. **Error Message**: The error message indicates an assertion failure in the `test_info` test case. The expected output `Fish Shell 3.5.9` does not match the actual output `Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9`.

3. **Expected Input/Output Values**:
   - Input: The `Popen` object with return value `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`
   - Expected Output: `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`

4. **GitHub Issue**: The reported issue relates to the use of the thefuck plugin causing a recursive loop with Fish Shell initialization due to the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file.

5. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - The cause of the discrepancy between actual and expected output is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the version string from the `Popen` object.
   - To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract and format the version string from the `Popen` output.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `info` function below:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting version from 'fish, version x.y.z' format
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly extract the version string from the `Popen` output and return it in the required format. This fix should resolve the assertion failure in the test case and align with the expected input/output values.
