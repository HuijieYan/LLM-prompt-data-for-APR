### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell.
2. **Error Location**: The error is related to comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `info` function.
3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug is caused by the incorrect format of the version extracted from the shell. The version is returned in the format `'fish, version x.x.x\n'`, while the expected format is `'Fish Shell x.x.x'`.
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: The version string extracted from the shell needs to be formatted correctly to match the expected output.

### Code Fix
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[-1]  # Extract version from format 'fish, version x.x.x\n'
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this fix, the function will correctly extract the version from the Fish shell output and format it as expected.
