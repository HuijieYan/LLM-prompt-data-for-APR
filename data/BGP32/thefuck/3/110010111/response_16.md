### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess. The issue is related to the comparison between the expected version number and the actual version number returned by the subprocess.
2. The error message indicates an assertion failure due to a mismatch in the version format.
3. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the returned value includes additional text `fish, version` before the actual version number. This discrepancy causes the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the processing of the version string returned from the subprocess to extract only the version number and format it correctly before returning the final string.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the code to extract only the version number from the returned string, we can ensure that the output matches the expected format `'Fish Shell X.X.X'`, resolving the assertion error.
