### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship:**
   - The buggy function `info` is a method of the `Fish` class.
  
2. **Potential Error Locations:**
   - The issue might be related to how the version is extracted from the process output and formatted.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug occurs due to the incorrect formatting of the version extracted from the `Fish` shell command. The format of the output "fish, version 3.5.9\n" is causing the assertion error because it is not just the version number.
  
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Modify the way the version is extracted to only get the version number without additional text.
   - Update the expected output to match just the version number.
  
5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, with this corrected version, the extracted version number will be formatted as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' which matches the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
