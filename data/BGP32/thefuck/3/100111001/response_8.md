### Analysis
#### Error Location
The error seems to be occurring in the assertion comparing the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` with the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

#### Bug Cause
The buggy function is not correctly fetching the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. It is directly fetching the output without processing it to extract the version number.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the version number is extracted from the command output before returning it.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After applying this fix, the function should be able to correctly extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
