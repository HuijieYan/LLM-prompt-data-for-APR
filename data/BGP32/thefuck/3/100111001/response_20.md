The issue in the provided buggy function lies in how the version string is extracted from the output of the 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"' command. The test is expecting the version to be extracted from the output correctly and match the expected result, but the current implementation does not handle this extraction properly.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. The command 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"' returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of only the version number.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the command to 'fish -c "echo $version"' to only retrieve the version number without any additional information.
2. Strip any unnecessary characters or whitespace from the extracted version before returning it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly extract the version number '3.5.9' from the output and pass the failing test.
