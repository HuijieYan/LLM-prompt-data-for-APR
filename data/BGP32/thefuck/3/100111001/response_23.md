The error in the buggy function `info` is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The test expects the command `fish --version` to be executed, but the function is running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This results in the version being extracted incorrectly leading to the assertion failure in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`. This will ensure that the correct version format is retrieved and compared with the expected version in the test.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this modification, the function will now correctly extract the version using the `fish --version` command, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
