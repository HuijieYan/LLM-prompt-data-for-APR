### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting the version without the "fish, version" prefix, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug originates from the way the shell version is extracted from the `proc` output. The `info` function is currently directly using the output as the version without stripping the unnecessary prefix. This leads to a mismatch between the expected version and the actual version retrieved from the command.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly extract and format the version from the output. We should first strip the unnecessary prefix "fish, version" before constructing the return string.

### Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace("fish, version ", "")
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By incorporating the suggested fix in the corrected function, the unnecessary "fish, version" prefix will be removed before constructing the return string. This correction should now make the function compatible with the test case and pass the assertion successfully.
