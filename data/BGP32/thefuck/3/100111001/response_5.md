### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the expected output is not being retrieved correctly.
2. The failing test is expecting the version to be extracted properly and formatted as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it is not achieving that.
3. The error message highlights the mismatch in the expected version formatting.
4. The input parameter `Popen` is mocked in the failing test to simulate the behavior of the `Popen` subprocess call.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the output from the `Popen` call is processed to extract the version information.

### Bug:
The bug lies in how the `Popen` object is used to read the output and extract the version information. The function is not correctly handling the output from `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which is causing the version formatting issue.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the output is read from the `Popen` object and extract the correct version information.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version of the function will properly extract the version information from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and format it as expected.
