The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `info()` function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but this is not the correct command to use. The correct command should be `fish --version` which would return the version information in the desired format.

### Fixing the Bug
We need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` to correctly fetch the version. Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the function will correctly retrieve the version information and the failing test should now pass.

This fix ensures that the correct command is used to fetch the Fish shell version, resolving the discrepancy in the test case output and the expected value.
