### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` and then reading the output. However, in the failing test, the expected output is `fish, version 3.5.9\n` which is different from what the function is trying to extract. This mismatch in the expected output and the actual output is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being used to get the Fish shell version. The actual output is different from what the function is expecting, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version to match the expected output in the failing test. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` should be changed to `fish --version`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
