### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, the test is failing because the expected command to be executed is `['fish', '--version']` but the buggy function is calling `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being passed to the `Popen` function. This leads to the version string not being correctly retrieved from the output of the command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the command passed to the `Popen` function in the `info` function from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `--version` command and the failing test should pass.
