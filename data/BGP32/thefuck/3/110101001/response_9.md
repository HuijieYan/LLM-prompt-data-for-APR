### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to fetch the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the actual command being executed in the subprocess is `fish --version`. This discrepancy is causing the function to fail the test as it is expecting the version information in a different format.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being passed to the subprocess. The test is expecting the version information to be extracted from `fish --version` output, but the function is currently fetching the version information from `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed in the subprocess to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version of the function `info` will execute `fish --version` to fetch the version information and return it in the expected format.
