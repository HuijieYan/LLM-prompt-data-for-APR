### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and returning the version in a specific format. However, the failing test is not passing as expected. The test is setting the return value of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is reading from `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`, so there is a mismatch in the expected and actual values.

### Bug in the code
The bug in the code lies in the mismatch between the expected value set in the test and the actual value received by the function. The function is reading the version information in a different format than what is set in the test case. Additionally, the command being executed is different in the function and the test.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function reads the version information in the same format as set in the test case. We also need to align the command being executed in the function with what is expected in the test.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1].strip('\n')
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the command to `['fish', '--version']` and extracting the version information correctly in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
