### Potential Error Locations:
1. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` may not return the correct version of Fish shell.
2. The decoding process `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` may not handle the output correctly.
3. The format string `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` could be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and potential issues with decoding and formatting the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Ensure correct handling of the output by decoding it properly.
3. Verify the format string used to create the shell information.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version.split(", version ")[1]}'
``` 

After applying the corrections and running the failing test case again, the corrected version of the function should pass the test successfully.
