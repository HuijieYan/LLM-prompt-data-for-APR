### Analysis:

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the test is expecting the version to be obtained using `fish --version`. This mismatch in the command used to fetch the version is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The function is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version, causing a mismatch with the expected output from the test.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the command in the `Popen` call to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to align with the expectations of the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
