### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, the test is expecting the version to be obtained by running `fish --version`, which is inconsistent with the actual command being executed.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the mismatch between the command used to get the Fish shell version in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) and the expected command in the test (`fish --version`). This causes the test to fail as the version fetched by the `info` function is different from the expected version.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` function call within the `info` function to fetch the version correctly.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By changing the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the fetched version matches the expected version in the test.
