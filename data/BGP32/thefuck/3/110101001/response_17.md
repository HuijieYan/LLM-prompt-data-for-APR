### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output as `Fish Shell [version]`. The failing test sets up the `Popen` mock to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is reading it as `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect reading and decoding of the output from the `proc` subprocess. The function is expecting the output to be read as bytes, but the test setup provides it as a string with an extra newline character.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output is read correctly as bytes and then decoded properly. Additionally, we need to update the test setup to provide the expected byte output without the extra newline character.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip().replace(', version ', ''))  # Correcting the output format

```

After correcting the function, the failing test should now pass as the output will be properly read and formatted.
