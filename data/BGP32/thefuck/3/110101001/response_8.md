### Analysis:
The bug in the `info` function is likely caused by attempting to read the output of the `proc` object using `proc.stdout.read()` before waiting for the process to complete. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should wait for the process to complete before reading the output. We can achieve this by calling `proc.communicate()` after running the command with `Popen` to ensure that the process finishes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.communicate()
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
