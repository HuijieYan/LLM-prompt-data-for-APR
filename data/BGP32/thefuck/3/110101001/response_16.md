### Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the test is configured to expect the output of `fish --version`.

Based on the provided runtime values, it seems that the `Popen` call is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch in the expected output.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the expected output (`fish --version`) set in the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed by `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the info function in the Fish class

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making this correction, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command, and the test should now pass successfully.
