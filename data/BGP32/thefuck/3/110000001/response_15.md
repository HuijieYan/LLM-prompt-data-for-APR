## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish in this case. The function uses subprocess to run a command that echoes the value of the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable, which should be the version of the Fish shell. However, the bug lies in how the function handles reading the output from the subprocess.

## Error Location:
The error is in the line `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. The `proc.stdout.read()` call reads data from the output stream of the process, but it doesn't block to wait for the process to finish. This can result in an empty string being read if the data is not available immediately.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function tries to read the output before the process finishes writing to it, leading to an empty string. This happens because the function doesn't wait for the process to complete execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before attempting to read its output. This can be achieved by adding `proc.wait()` before reading the output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we added `proc.wait()` after starting the process using Popen. This ensures that the function waits for the process to finish executing before trying to read the output. This should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly return the name and version of the Fish shell.
