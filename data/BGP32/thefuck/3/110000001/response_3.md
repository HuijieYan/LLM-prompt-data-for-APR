### Analysis:
- The function `info` is part of the `Fish` class.
- The function uses the `Popen` method to execute a subprocess that gets the version of the fish shell.
- The issue here is related to how the output is read from the process created by `Popen`.

### Error Location:
- The problem lies in the way the output from the process is read and decoded. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is used directly without checking if the process has completed.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because `proc.stdout.read()` is called before the process has finished executing. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect output being read, resulting in an unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix involves waiting for the process to finish executing before reading its output. This can be achieved by calling `proc.wait()` before reading from `proc.stdout`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.wait()` before reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the process has completed execution and the output is available to be read correctly.
