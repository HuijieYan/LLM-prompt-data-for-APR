## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically for Fish shell. However, the bug lies in the way the subprocess is being handled and the reading of the output stream.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of subprocess communication.
2. Reading the output of the subprocess in an incorrect way.
3. Failure to handle errors during the subprocess execution.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect way process output is being read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`. This can lead to potential issues in capturing the output of the subprocess correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of the subprocess communication and correctly read the output from the subprocess. Using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object is a safer approach to capture the output and errors in a more robust way.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

import sys
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            output = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, encoding='utf-8')
            stdout, stderr = output.communicate()
            if stdout:
                version = stdout.strip()
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return 'Unknown'
        except Exception as e:
            # Print the exception to stderr and return 'Unknown' as the version
            print(e, file=sys.stderr)
            return 'Unknown'
```

In the corrected version of the `info` function, we handle the subprocess communication using the `communicate()` method, capturing both the stdout and stderr output. We then proceed to extract and return the version information if present, otherwise returning 'Unknown'. Additionally, we catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution, print them to stderr, and return 'Unknown' as the version.
