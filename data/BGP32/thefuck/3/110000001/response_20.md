## Analysis:
1. The `info` function is part of the `Fish` class.
2. The function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess.
3. The potential error lies in the way the function is trying to read the output from the subprocess.
4. The bug is caused by not waiting for the subprocess to finish before attempting to read its output.
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to wait for the subprocess to complete before reading its output.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the subprocess to complete and read its output. By doing this, we ensure that the function correctly captures the version of the Fish shell without any potential race conditions.
