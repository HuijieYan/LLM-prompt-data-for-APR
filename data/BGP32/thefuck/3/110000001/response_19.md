The potential error in the provided buggy function is that it doesn't properly wait for the process to finish before trying to read from its output stream. This can lead to a race condition where the process may not have completed yet, causing an empty output.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object which will wait for the process to terminate and then return a tuple of stdout and stderr streams. We can then extract the stdout from this tuple and get the version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the process has completed before trying to read its output. This should fix the bug and provide the correct version of the Fish Shell.
