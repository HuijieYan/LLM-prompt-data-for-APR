## Analysis:
The buggy function `info(self)` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' using subprocess. However, there are potential error locations in the code related to how the output of the subprocess is handled.

## Error Locations:
1. Calling `proc.stdout.read()` without checking if the process has completed or not, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect output reading.
2. Not handling potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the subprocess output, which can lead to incorrect version information being returned.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to complete and handle the stdout and stderr streams properly.
2. Add error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version"
```

In the corrected version, we wait for the process to complete using `proc.communicate()`, handle the stdout and errors properly, decode the output and strip any extra characters. Additionally, error handling is included to prevent the program from crashing in case of exceptions during the subprocess execution.
