## Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class. This function is attempting to obtain the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using subprocess and then reading the output. The bug seems to be related to how the output is being read and decoded.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the output from the subprocess might not be the correct method.
2. Decoding the output using `utf-8` might be causing the issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function is likely due to how the output from the subprocess is being read and decoded. The `decode('utf-8')` method might not correctly convert the output to a string, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the output from the subprocess is read and decoded to ensure the correct version of the Fish shell is obtained.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip() if version_bytes else "Unknown"
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
