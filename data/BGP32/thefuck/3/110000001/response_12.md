## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen`.
2. The function reads the output of the process to get the version, but it might run into issues due to improper handling of the subprocess output or potential blocking issues.

## Bug Description:
The bug in the current function lies in how it reads the output from the subprocess. The `proc.stdout.read()` method might block if the subprocess doesn't finish executing, leading to potential issues or delays.

## Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the subprocess has completed before reading its output. One way to ensure this is by using `communicate()` method to read the output safely without blocking.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The fixed version of the 'info' function in the 'Fish' class
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
