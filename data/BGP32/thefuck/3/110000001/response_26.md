## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and capture the output. However, there are potential error locations within the function that can lead to bugs.

## Error Locations:
1. Lack of proper error handling: The function does not handle potential errors that might occur during the execution of the `Popen` command.
2. Incorrect handling of subprocess output: The function reads the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` which may not work correctly in all cases.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function may occur due to the lack of error handling and incorrect subprocess output handling. If the `Popen` command fails for any reason, the function may raise exceptions or return incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add proper error handling using `try-except` blocks to catch and handle any exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the `Popen` command.
2. Use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to correctly read the output of the subprocess and handle it accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function with added error handling and proper subprocess output handling:

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return f'Fish Shell {version}'
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Failed to get Fish Shell version: {str(e)}'
```

In this corrected version, we have added a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur. We also replaced `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `proc.communicate()` to correctly read the output of the subprocess. The function now handles errors gracefully and provides a more robust way to retrieve the name and version of the Fish shell.
