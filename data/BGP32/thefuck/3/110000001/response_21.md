## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The function uses Popen from the subprocess module to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, capture the output, and then format it into a string to return.

## Potential Errors:
1. Not handling errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.
2. Reading from `proc.stdout` directly without checking if the process has completed.
3. Incorrect handling of decoding the output from bytes to a string.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in this function occurs when trying to read the output from the subprocess before it has finished executing. This can lead to an incomplete or empty output being returned.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess object to wait for the process to finish and get the output.
2. Handle any potential errors that may occur during subprocess execution.
3. Decode the output using the `communicate()` method result instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            if proc.returncode == 0:
                version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return "Failed to get Fish Shell version"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to get Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()`, the function will wait for the process to finish and get the output correctly. Additionally, error handling has been included to handle any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.
