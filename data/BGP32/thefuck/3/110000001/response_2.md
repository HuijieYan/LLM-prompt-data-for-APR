The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in the subprocess. However, there are potential error locations in the code that could lead to bugs:

1. The `Popen` object needs to be properly managed to avoid potential resource leaks.
2. The `communicate()` method should be used instead of reading the output stream directly.
3. Potential encoding issues when decoding the output stream.

The cause of the bug can be due to not properly handling the subprocess execution and output retrieval, which can lead to potential resource leaks, incomplete output reading, or encoding errors.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly handle the execution and output retrieval. This method ensures that the subprocess is executed and its output is read completely. Additionally, encoding issues should be handled appropriately to decode the output stream.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
