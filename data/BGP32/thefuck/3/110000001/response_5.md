## Analysis:
The function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to extract the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The output of the subprocess is read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. The potential error lies in reading the output before waiting for the process to complete.

## Potential Errors:
1. Reading the output before waiting for the process to complete.
2. Not handling potential errors that may occur during the subprocess call.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reading the output of the subprocess before it has completed, leading to incomplete or missing output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix involves waiting for the process to complete before reading its output to ensure that the output is complete. Additionally, error handling should be implemented to deal with any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess call.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to wait for the process to complete and get the output. The output is then decoded and stripped to extract the version of the Fish shell. This approach ensures that the output is complete before processing it.
