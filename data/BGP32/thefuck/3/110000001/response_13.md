## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the issue lies in how the function is handling reading and decoding the output from the process.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading process output without waiting for the process to complete.
2. Not handling errors that may occur during the process execution.
3. Incorrectly decoding the output from the process.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not waiting for the process to complete before reading the output. This can result in an empty string being read if the process hasn't finished executing by the time the output is being read.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to complete before reading the output. This can be achieved by using `communicate()` method of the `Popen` class, which will wait for the process to complete and then return the output in a tuple. We also need to handle any errors that may occur during the process execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
