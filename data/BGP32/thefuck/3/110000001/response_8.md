The potential error in the provided buggy function is the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without considering that it might not have finished writing to the PIPE yet. This can lead to incomplete or missing output being read.

To fix this issue, we can use `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object which reads all data from stdout and stderr streams and waits until the process terminates. This ensures that we get the complete output from the command execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()`, we ensure that the function waits for the process to finish and reads all the output from the command execution.

This corrected version of the `info` function should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without reading incomplete data.
