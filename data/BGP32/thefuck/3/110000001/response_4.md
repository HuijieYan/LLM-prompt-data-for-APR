## Analysis
The provided function `info()` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. The execution of the command is done using the `subprocess.Popen()` method. The output of the command is then read and returned as the version of the shell.

## Identified Issue
The issue in the buggy function lies in how the output of the subprocess is being handled. The `proc.stdout.read()` method reads from the pipe associated with the subprocess and consumes the output. However, the read method consumes the output just once, and if called multiple times, it may return empty strings or inaccessible content.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `proc.stdout.read()` method is being called twice in the function. The first call reads the output from the subprocess, but the second call would not have any content left to read, resulting in an empty string being returned. This leads to an incorrect or missing version information being displayed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the output of the subprocess needs to be stored in a variable after the first read and then decoded and manipulated as needed. By storing the output, we ensure that it is accessible and can be used in the subsequent operations without losing its content.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()` is used to read the stdout and stderr of the process. It returns a tuple containing the output streams, which are then unpacked into `output` and `_` (to ignore stderr). This ensures that the output is read only once and can be decoded correctly to get the version information before being returned.
