## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `subprocess.Popen` module. The bug seems to be in how the function is trying to read the output from the process.

## Identified Bug
The bug lies in the way the function is attempting to read the output of the `Popen` process. The `stdout.read()` method is not the correct way to get the output as it might not have all the data ready to read at that point.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by prematurely reading the output from the process before it has completed writing, potentially leading to incomplete or missing output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should wait for the process to finish and then read the output. This can be achieved by using the `proc.communicate()` method which waits for the process to terminate and returns a tuple of `(stdoutdata, stderrdata)`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdoutdata, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdoutdata.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and get the output. Then we decode the output to string format and strip any whitespace characters before returning the version of the Fish shell. This should fix the bug in the original function.
