The potential error in the provided function is related to the read operation on `proc.stdout`. The issue here is that the `proc.stdout` has not been closed before reading it.

When a process is executed using `Popen`, it is necessary to close the stdout and stderr pipes to prevent potential deadlocks. If the pipes are not closed, it can lead to the process waiting indefinitely for the stdout or stderr to be completely read, causing the program to hang.

To fix this issue, the correct approach is to close the stdout pipe after reading from it. Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Close the stdout pipe to prevent potential deadlocks
    proc.stdout.close()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding `proc.stdout.close()` after reading from the stdout pipe, we ensure that the pipe is closed properly, preventing any potential deadlocks.
