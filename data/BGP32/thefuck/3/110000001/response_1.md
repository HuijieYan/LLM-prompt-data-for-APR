The bug in the provided function `info` is that it is not waiting for the Popen process to complete before trying to read the output. This can lead to the `proc.stdout.read()` call not getting any data, resulting in an empty version.

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to complete before reading the output. We can achieve this by using the `proc.communicate()` method, which waits for the process to finish and then returns a tuple of stdout and stderr data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish, we ensure that the output is available for reading and prevent the function from returning an empty version.
