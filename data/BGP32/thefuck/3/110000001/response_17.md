## Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the subprocess output. The `proc.stdout.read()` method reads the output of the subprocess but doesn't wait for the process to finish leading to an incomplete reading of the output. This can result in missing or incomplete data being processed.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output. This can be achieved by calling `proc.wait()` after starting the subprocess to ensure that the output is fully available for reading.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function 
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the subprocess to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the correction included, the function now waits for the subprocess to complete before reading its output, ensuring the correct and complete version information is obtained from the `fish` shell.
