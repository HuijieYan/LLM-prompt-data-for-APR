### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess using `Popen`. However, the bug arises from not properly handling the subprocess output. 

### Identification of Potential Errors:
1. Reading the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()` without taking into consideration that it might not have finished writing to the pipe, resulting in an empty output.
2. The `stderr=DEVNULL` argument might suppress error messages, leading to potential debugging difficulties.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the current function occurs because the subprocess output is read before it has been fully written, resulting in an empty or incomplete version string being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish writing the output and ensure error handling is done correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        out, err = proc.communicate()
        
        if proc.returncode == 0:
            version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return 'Failed to retrieve version information for Fish Shell'
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed `stderr=DEVNULL` to `stderr=PIPE` in `Popen` to capture potential error messages.
- Used `proc.communicate()` to wait for the subprocess to finish and retrieve both the output and error streams.
- Checked the return code of the subprocess to determine if the command was successful.
- Decoded and extracted the version string from the output only if the return code indicates success.
