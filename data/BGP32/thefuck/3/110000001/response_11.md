## Analysis:
The provided buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess and capturing the output. However, there are potential error locations within this function:
1. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is used without calling `wait()` on the process, which may lead to incorrect results or potential issues.
2. There is a lack of error handling in case the subprocess fails to execute the command.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation of the `info` function arises due to not waiting for the subprocess to finish executing the command before reading its output. This can lead to race conditions and potential data corruption.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you should ensure that the process has finished executing the command before reading its output. It is recommended to use the `proc.communicate()` method to ensure the process finishes before accessing its output. Additionally, error handling should be added to catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function with the necessary fixes implemented:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip() if output else ''
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `proc.communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to finish execution and capture its output.
- Error handling can be added to handle any exceptions that might occur during the subprocess execution.

This corrected version ensures that the function properly captures the version of the Fish shell without potential race conditions or data corruption.
