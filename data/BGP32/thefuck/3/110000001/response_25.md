## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess command. The problem lies in how the output of the subprocess is being handled, which may lead to incorrect results or errors.

## Identified Error Locations
1. The `info` function reads the stdout of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which may not read all of the output, potentially leading to missing information.
2. There is no handling of exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution, such as errors in running `fish` command.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function arises from improper handling of the subprocess output and lack of error handling. As a result, the version of the Fish shell may not be captured correctly, and exceptions thrown during the subprocess execution are not being caught.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use `communicate()` method of the subprocess object to capture the output completely.
2. Implement proper exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            return "Fish Shell version not found"
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We use `proc.communicate()` to capture the output completely.
- We add a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution and return an informative message in case of an error.
