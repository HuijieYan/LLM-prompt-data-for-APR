### Analysis:
The `info` function is attempting to check the version of the Fish Shell by running a command using `Popen` from `subprocess`. However, there are potential error locations in the code:
1. Reading the output from a process requires handling for possible errors, such as waiting for the process to finish.
2. If the process encounters an error, it might not provide the expected version output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current code is that the `info` function does not correctly read the output from the `Popen` process. This may result in an empty version string being returned when trying to get the Fish Shell version.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the process output and any potential errors that may occur during its execution. Using `communicate()` method of the process object can be a better way to handle process output and errors.

### Corrected Version:
I will provide the corrected version of the `info` function below:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Read the output and wait for the process to finish
    if proc.returncode == 0:  # Check if the process ran successfully
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
```

In this corrected version, I have added the `proc.communicate()` method to read the output and wait for the process to finish. Then, I check if the process ran successfully using `proc.returncode`. If successful, I decode the output and return the version, otherwise, I return an error message. This should help in accurately fetching and returning the Fish Shell version.
