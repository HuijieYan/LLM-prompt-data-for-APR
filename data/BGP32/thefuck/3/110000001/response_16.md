## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is part of the class `Fish`, which appears to be a subclass of `Generic`. The function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess and capturing the output. However, there are potential error locations that could cause the buggy behavior:
1. Reading from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to complete could lead to an empty output or incorrect information.
2. The `Popen` function might not be handling the command execution properly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the current function lies in prematurely reading from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to complete. This can result in an incomplete output or no output at all, causing the `version` variable to be incorrect. 

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the process has completed before reading from `proc.stdout`. This can be achieved by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to complete and then returns the output. Additionally, we need to handle any potential errors that may arise during the command execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any errors that may occur during command execution
            return "An error occurred while retrieving the Fish shell version"
``` 

In the corrected version, we have added a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the command execution. We also replaced `proc.stdout.read()` with `proc.communicate()` to ensure that we wait for the process to complete before reading the output. This should address the bug and provide a more robust function.
