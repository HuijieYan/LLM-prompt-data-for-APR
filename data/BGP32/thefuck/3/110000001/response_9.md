### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class uses `Popen` to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the way the function reads the output from the process is causing the bug.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reading the output from the process using `proc.stdout.read()`.
2. Decoding the output with `utf-8`.
3. Stripping the output to remove whitespace characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function is reading the output from the `Popen` process. Calling `proc.stdout.read()` directly might result in incomplete or blocked reading of the output, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's recommended to use `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the output and error streams properly. This method ensures that the process is finished before reading its output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()` to read the output, the corrected version ensures proper completion of the process and correct reading of the output stream.
