## Analysis:
The buggy function "info" is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using subprocess. However, it seems that the reading of the output from the process is not being handled correctly. The function is attempting to read from "proc.stdout" directly without waiting for the process to complete or handling potential errors.

## Error Locations:
1. The function is not waiting for the completion of the process before trying to read from stdout.
2. There is no error handling in case the process encounters any issues.
3. Reading from stdout directly without checking if the process execution was successful.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the subprocess output. The function is trying to read from the stdout of the process without ensuring that the process has finished execution successfully. This can lead to the function attempting to read from an empty stdout buffer, resulting in incorrect or missing output.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the process completes execution before attempting to read the output.
2. Add error handling in case the process encounters any issues during execution.
3. Check the return code of the process to verify successful execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            if proc.returncode == 0:  # Check if process executed successfully
                version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `proc.communicate()` to ensure the process completes execution and capture the stdout.
2. Check the return code of the process to verify successful execution.
3. Added error handling using a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the process execution.
