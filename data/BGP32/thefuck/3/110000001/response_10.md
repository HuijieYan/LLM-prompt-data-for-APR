## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. However, the bug in this function lies in how the output of the command is read.

## Identified bug:
The bug in the function is related to how the output of the command executed by `Popen` is read. Calling `proc.stdout.read()` directly may lead to issues like hanging or incomplete reading of the output.

## Cause of the bug:
The `proc.stdout.read()` function blocks program execution until the output is fully available. If the output is large or the process hangs, the program will be stuck waiting for the process to complete, leading to unresponsiveness.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can use `communicate()` method provided by the subprocess module which will read and return the output after the process is finished. This method will ensure that the program does not hang or block while waiting for the output.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we are using `proc.communicate()` to get the output of the process after it has finished executing. This will prevent any potential blocking issues that could arise from directly reading from the stdout.
