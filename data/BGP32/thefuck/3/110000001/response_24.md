## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing the output. However, there are potential error locations within the function that could result in bugs:
1. The function reads the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read()`, which may not return the output immediately and could lead to empty or incomplete results.
2. There is a missing import for the `Generic` class in the function definition.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the subprocess output read operation, which may lead to empty or incomplete results, resulting in an incorrect version information.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should wait for the subprocess to finish and then read the output to ensure we get the complete version information. Additionally, we need to import the `Generic` class to ensure the function definition is correct.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from ..types import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
  
    # corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

In the corrected version, using `proc.communicate()` waits for the subprocess to finish and returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr, which we then decode to get the version information. This ensures that we read the complete output of the subprocess. Additionally, the missing import for the `Generic` class is added to the corrected file.
