### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The `info` function is meant to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command in the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the function is returning a string in a different format than expected, leading to an assertion error in the test.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The way the version is extracted from the `proc.stdout.read()` output may not be correct.
2. The format used to construct the return string might be causing discrepancies.

### Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to how the version information is extracted and formatted. The function is expected to return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but due to the incorrect extraction and formatting, it is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the extraction process to correctly obtain only the version number from the output.
2. Update the way the return string is constructed to match the expected format.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version information based on `', version '`, we extract only the version number. This corrected version should now return the expected `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` format and pass the failing test.
