### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to extract the Fish shell version using a subprocess call and return it in a specific format. The error message indicates that the returned value is not in the expected format. This is likely due to the fact that the subprocess call is returning the version string along with additional text like "fish, version". The test case is expecting only the version number.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is not properly extracting just the version number from the output of the subprocess call. It is including unnecessary text like "fish, version".

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess call.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_parts = version.split(', ')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_parts[1])
```
