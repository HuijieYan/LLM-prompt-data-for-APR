### Analysis:
1. The `info` function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and extracting the version number.
2. The failing test is trying to assert that the extracted version matches a specific format.
3. The error message indicates that the returned version string does not match the expected format.
4. The cause of the bug is that the command executed to get the version is incorrect, leading to an unexpected string format.
5. A strategy to fix the bug is to modify the command executed to retrieve the Fish shell version.

### Correction:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the command to retrieve the version using `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the correct version format is extracted. The corrected function should pass the failing test.
