### Analysis
1. The buggy function `info(self)` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not correctly extracting the version information.
2. The failing test is setting up the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` to simulate the output of `fish --version`, but the function does not handle the output correctly.
3. The error occurs because the function is not extracting the version information properly from the output of `fish --version`, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function reads the correct output from `fish --version` and extracts the version information accurately.
5. We need to modify the function to correctly handle the output of `fish --version` and extract the version information to format the output string accordingly.

### Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip().replace('version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the `Popen` command to retrieve `fish --version` output correctly and extracting the version information accurately from the output, the corrected version of the function should now provide the expected result and pass the failing test.
