### Explanation
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing a command. However, the command executed to retrieve the version is incorrect, leading to the wrong output and causing the test to fail.

The failing test expects the shell version to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output from the function is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy in the version string causes the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. Currently, the command used is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which is incorrect. The correct command to fetch the Fish shell version is `'fish', '--version'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_str.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract just the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
