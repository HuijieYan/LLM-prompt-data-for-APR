### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and extracting the version string. However, there are a few issues identified in the implementation:
1. The command used to retrieve the version is checking for `FISH_VERSION`, which may not return the correct version string.
2. The expected output format is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the current implementation is not parsing the version correctly, leading to a mismatch.
3. The test is also asserting the command `['fish', '--version']`, which is inconsistent with the actual command in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function is not parsing the version string correctly from the command output, leading to a version string mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and ensure that the version string is parsed correctly to match the expected format in the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
