The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish version. The function is currently running 'echo $FISH_VERSION' as the command, while the test is expecting the command to be 'fish --version'.

### Bug Explanation:
- The function is not executing the correct command to fetch the version information.
- The test is mocking the output for 'fish --version' command, but the function is running 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
- As a result, the function returns the incorrect version format which causes the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to match the expected output.
- Modify the function to read the correct version format from the command output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

        # Extract the version information properly
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  

        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now return the correct version format 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected by the test, and the test should pass successfully.
