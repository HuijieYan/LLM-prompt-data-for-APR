### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the version of the Fish shell, formatted as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.
2. The provided test function is mocking the `Popen` process to return `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when called with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
3. The error occurs because the function is not correctly parsing the version string from the output of the `Popen` process. The expected version is `'3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract and format the version from the output.
5. We should modify the function to extract just the version number from the output and format it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

Now the function will correctly extract the version number `3.5.9` from the output `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` and format it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
