### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` and capturing the output. However, the command being executed (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not provide the desired output format (e.g., `3.5.9`) directly. This leads to the incorrect version extraction in the function, causing the test to fail.

The failing test is providing the expected output in the format `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, which is not being achieved due to the incorrect parsing of the shell version in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the output format of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which returns `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. This output includes additional text and formatting that needs to be cleaned before constructing the version string `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract and clean the shell version from the command output. We should only retain the version number part (`3.5.9`), remove unnecessary text, and then construct the desired formatted version string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly extract and format the shell version from the command output, allowing it to pass the failing test.
