### Potential Error Locations
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version might not be correct.
2. The decoding or stripping of the retrieved version string might not be done properly.
3. The format string used to construct the output might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the Popen call. The retrieved version string is not decoded or stripped properly, resulting in the comparison failure in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the command used in Popen to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Ensure proper decoding and stripping of the retrieved version string.
3. Update the format string used to construct the output with the correct version.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
