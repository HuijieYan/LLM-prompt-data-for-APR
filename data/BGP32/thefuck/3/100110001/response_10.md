### Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running a command and reading the output.
2. The test is mocking the `Popen` call to simulate the execution of the `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` command and returning a version output.
3. The error message indicates that the returned version does not match the expected version, likely due to the way the version output is processed.
4. The bug is most likely due to the incorrect process of reading the output from the `Popen` subprocess.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the version output is extracted and formatted. The issue is with the part of the `info` function where the reading of the output from `proc.stdout` is done.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the subprocess is read using `communicate()` function.

### The corrected version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By using `proc.communicate()[0]` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we can correctly read the output of the subprocess and strip it without any issues.
