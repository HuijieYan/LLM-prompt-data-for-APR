## Analysis:
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the Fish shell version.
2. The test is patching the `stdout.read` method of the `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. This means that the test expects the command output to be `fish, version 3.5.9\n`.
3. The error message indicates that the `info` function returns `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

## Bug:
The bug lies in the way the Fish shell version is extracted from the command output. The `info` function does not properly extract and format the version string, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to parse the Fish shell version correctly from the command output and format it accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version_str = version_bytes.decode('utf-8')
    # Extracting the version from the output
    version = version_str.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version properly parses the Fish shell version from the command output and returns it in the correct format. It should now pass the failing test.
