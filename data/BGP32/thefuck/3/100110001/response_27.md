## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'` through the `Popen` method and capturing the output. The test function `test_info` sets the expected output to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. However, the command being executed in the `info` function does not match the expected output in the test, leading to a failing assertion.

## Issue:
1. The command provided to `Popen` in the `info` function is retrieving the value of `$FISH_VERSION` but the test expects the version to be extracted from `'fish --version'`.
2. The way version information is fetched and formatted in the `info` function is different from what the test expects.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, update the `info` function to execute `'fish --version'` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and then format the output accordingly to match the expected output in the test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
    version = version_output.strip().split(' ')[2]  # Extract version from output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly extract the version information from the `fish --version` command output and match the expected output in the test.
