## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the expected version output format is not being retrieved in the function. This is evident from the failing test, which mocks the shell version as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.

## Identification of Bug:
The bug exists in the way the function is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not provide the correct format for the version, resulting in an incorrect output.

## Bug Cause:
The key issue is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is returning additional text (`fish, version ...`) along with the version number. This extra text is not expected and causes the assertion in the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, you need to update the command executed to retrieve only the version number without additional text. Potentially, we can use the `--version` flag instead of relying on the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    first_line = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = first_line.split(',')[1].strip().replace('version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are executing `fish --version` to directly retrieve the correct version information. The modified code then extracts the version number from the output for generating the correct formatted string. This modification should ensure that the function returns the correct version when called in the test.
