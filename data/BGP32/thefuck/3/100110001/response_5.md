### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `info(self)` from the `fish.py` file.
2. The test function that checks the `info()` method on the shell object is failing due to a version mismatch.
3. The `info()` function in `fish.py` is reading the output of the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but the test is setting the expected version to `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. Additionally, the command used in the Popen call is different from the version check in the test.
4. To fix this bug, we need to change the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly match the version extraction logic.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

## Corrected Version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function should correctly extract the version information of the Fish shell, and the test provided should pass successfully.
