## Analysis
1. The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command. The command used is incorrect, which results in the version string not being retrieved properly.
2. The test expects the version to be processed correctly in the `info` function, which is not happening due to the incorrect command.
3. The error message specifically indicates that the version retrieved by the function is not formatted correctly.
4. To fix this bug, the command executed by the `Popen` call in the `info` function needs to be corrected to retrieve the Fish shell version accurately.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1]  # Extracting the version string after the comma
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`, we now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, by splitting the version string at the comma and selecting the second part (index 1), we can extract the version number cleanly.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the `info` function in the Fish shell class works as intended and passes the failing test.
