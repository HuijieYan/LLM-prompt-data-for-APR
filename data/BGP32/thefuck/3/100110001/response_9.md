## Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in fish.py is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess and reading its output.
2. The test function is setting up a mock for `Popen` to return a specific version string when `.stdout.read()` is called. However, the command being run in the buggy function is different from the one expected by the test.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output obtained by the buggy function includes extra information ("fish, version") which is not expected by the test, causing the assertion to fail.
4. To fix this bug, we need to change the command being run to obtain just the version number without any additional text.

## Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version number from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By changing the command argument from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `--version`, we ensure that only the version number is captured. The modified function accurately formats the output string by including only the version number without any extra text.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
