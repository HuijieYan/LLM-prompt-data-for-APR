### Analysis:
1. The `info` method in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell.
2. The `test_info` test case is mocking the `Popen` function to return a version-like string to test if the function behaves as expected when calling `info`.
3. The error message indicates that the returned value from the `info` method is not matching the expected result due to an incorrect format of the output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the command being executed to get the Fish version.

### Bug:
The bug appears to be in the command `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'])`. This command is not properly getting the Fish shell version. Additionally, the expected version output and the actual output are not being compared correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, update the command in `Popen` to be `'fish --version'` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version. Then modify the comparison of the expected output and the actual output in the test to only check the version number.

### The Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip().split()[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` method should correctly extract the Fish shell version from the output, and the test case should pass as expected.
