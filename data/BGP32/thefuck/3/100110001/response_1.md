### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` is trying to extract the Fish version by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command using `Popen`.
2. The test is setting up the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which is different from the expected version string `'3.5.9'`.
3. The error message indicates that the extracted version contains additional text `"fish, version"` which is not expected.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to extract the Fish version.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command passed to `Popen` to get the Fish version in a correct format. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we should use `fish --version` to capture the version directly from the shell.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_full = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_full.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. We use `['fish', '--version']` command to get the full version info directly.
2. We extract the version from the returned string by splitting it at `', version '`.
3. By doing this, the extracted version will be in the correct format.

This corrected version should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
