The buggy function is extracting the version string from the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting the version string to be extracted from the command `fish --version`. This discrepancy in commands is causing the assertion error.

To fix this, we need to update the function `info` in `thefuck/shells/fish.py` to read the correct command output. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are now capturing the output from `'fish --version'` command and parsing it to extract the version string correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test as the expected output matches the output provided by the corrected `info` function.
