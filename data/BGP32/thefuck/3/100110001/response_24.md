### Analysis:
1. The buggy `info` function in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, in the failing test, the expected version format (`'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`) does not match the reported version format (`'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`).
2. The discrepancy between the expected and reported version strings indicates a problem with how the version information is retrieved and parsed.
3. The error message clearly shows the mismatch between the expected version and the actual retrieved version, highlighting the issue with the formatting of the version string.
4. To fix this bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to extract the version correctly and format it according to the expected format.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the command executed by `Popen` to `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the exact version string.
2. Modify the parsing logic to extract the version number from the retrieved output, which should match the expected format `'Fish Shell X.X.X'`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    parsed_version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number after the ',' in the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(parsed_version)
```
