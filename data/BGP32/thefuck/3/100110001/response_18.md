## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info()` is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell installed in the system.
2. The test function `test_info` sets up a mock environment using `Popen` to mimic a command execution and check if the version is correctly obtained.
3. The failing test is asserting that the output of `shell.info()` should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the obtained value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
4. The cause of the bug is that the command used to fetch the version in the buggy function is not equal to the expected command.
5. To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen in the `info()` function needs to be corrected to match the expected version output.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version from 'fish, version 3.5.9' output
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly get the Fish shell version string, and then parsing out the version number from the output, the corrected function fetches the version properly. This correction aligns with the expected version format in the failing test, thereby resolving the bug.
