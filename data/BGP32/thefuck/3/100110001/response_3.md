## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current fish shell. The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning a string that includes some extra characters from the output of the `fish` command. The failing test expects the `Popen` call to have specific arguments, but the arguments of the `Popen` call in the buggy code are different.

## Identified Issue
1. The command being run in the `Popen` call is incorrect. The correct command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. The `Popen` call is missing encoding information which might cause timing issues due to reading from stdout.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function reads the version directly from the environment variable `$FISH_VERSION` set by the fish shell. Since this variable might contain additional information like `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, it leads to an unexpected output in the `version` variable. This discrepancy results in the assertion error when comparing the actual value with the expected value.

## Bug Fix
1. Replace the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Decode the output in the `Popen` call to ensure the correct reading.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By making these changes, the correct version of the fish shell will be extracted and returned without additional information, and the test should now pass successfully.
