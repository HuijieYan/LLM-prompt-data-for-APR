## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function, `get_new_command`, is supposed to modify a command related to `git push` based on the stderr output from a `git push` command. It attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the command and replace the `push` part with the suggested upstream branch.

The failing test asserts different scenarios involving the `git push` command with variations of flags and arguments, checking if the function correctly modifies the command as expected.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The use of `upstream_option_index` variable is supposed to capture the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the command, but the logic to check for both options is incorrect.
2. The slicing operation to extract the suggested upstream branch from `stderr` might not be accurate, especially if the format of the error message changes.

## Explaining the bug

The bug arises when the function fails to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag within the command, leading to incorrect modifications. Additionally, extracting the suggested upstream branch from the error message may lead to unexpected results if the format changes.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately to correctly identify their index.
2. Improve the extraction logic for the suggested upstream branch from the error message to ensure accuracy.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now be able to correctly handle the different scenarios presented in the failing test cases.
