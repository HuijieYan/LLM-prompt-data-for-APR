1. The buggy function is supposed to modify the command for git push by removing the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument, then extracting the suggested push command from the stderr. The function then replaces the push part of the command with the extracted push command.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The handling of the --set-upstream and -u flags may not work correctly as they are being checked individually in try-except blocks.
   - The removal of the --set-upstream and -u flag and its argument might not be accurate.
   - Extracting the push command from stderr might not be robust if the response message structure changes.

3. The bug arises because the upstream_option_index is checked using two separate try-except blocks, causing issues if one flag is found but not the other. Additionally, the removal of the flags and their arguments is done incorrectly. The extraction of the push command from the stderr assumes a fixed format of the error message, causing the function to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   - Check for both --set-upstream and -u flags in one step to accurately identify their presence.
   - Replace the removal logic of flags and arguments with a more accurate approach.
   - Use a more robust method to extract the push command from the stderr message.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u flags
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested push command from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines[::-1]:
        if line.strip().startswith('git push '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git push ')[2]
            break
    else:
        push_upstream = ''

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately handle the removal of the flags and their arguments, as well as extract the push command from the stderr message in a more robust manner.
