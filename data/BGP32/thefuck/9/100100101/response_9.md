The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic to handle `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list. The issue arises when attempting to remove these options from the list. The function incorrectly removes both the option and its argument by calling `pop` twice on the same index, which causes issues since the list shrinks after the first `pop` operation.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for removing the options by only calling `pop` once at the correct index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the push upstream branch is extracted correctly from the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options when concatenating the command parts. It should also extract the correct push upstream branch from the stderr message.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
