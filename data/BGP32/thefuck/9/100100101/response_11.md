### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command based on the output from `git push` command. It searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and removes it along with its argument if found. Then, it extracts the suggested command from the stderr output and replaces the push command with it.

The potential error in the function lies in the way it searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script parts. Currently, it uses two separate try-except blocks to search for each option individually. This design leads to issues because if the first option is not found, it will still proceed to search for the second option, potentially causing index errors. Additionally, the pop operation also fails to remove the correct elements if both options are present due to double index removal.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the script parts, the removal logic does not account for this situation correctly. The function may try to pop the same index twice due to the independent search for each option. This behavior results in an incorrect final script after the removal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in a single loop. Once we find and remove either option, we should break out of the loop to avoid multiple removal attempts. Additionally, we should only remove one index to ensure correctness when both options are present.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            continue

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the function will correctly search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in a single loop, remove the first occurrence found, and then break out of the loop to avoid any further incorrect removals. This should ensure the correct modification of the command as intended.
