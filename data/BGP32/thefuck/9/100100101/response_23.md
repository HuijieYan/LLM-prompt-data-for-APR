### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments and replacing them with the correct upstream branch. The bug lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is handled and how the correct branch is extracted from the stderr output.

### Error location:
1. The if condition that checks if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 is incorrect and should be changed.
2. The extraction of the correct push target from the stderr is not accurate, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the `upstream_option_index` is always set to `-1`, whether the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are found or not. This leads to an incorrect removal of the options from the `command.script_parts`, causing issues in forming the final command. Additionally, the extraction of the correct push target from `command.stderr` is not accurate, resulting in incorrect replacement arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for finding the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts`.
2. Adjust the extraction of the correct push target from the `command.stderr` to ensure the correct target branch is obtained.

### The Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if found
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove argument

    # Extract the correct push target from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    found_line = None
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('git push '):
            found_line = line
            break

    push_upstream = found_line.partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function addresses the issues in finding and removing the options correctly and extracting the correct push target from the `command.stderr`.
