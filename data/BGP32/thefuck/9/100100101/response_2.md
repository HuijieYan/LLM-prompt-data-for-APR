### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command's script parts. It then extracts the upstream branches suggested by git from the stderr and replaces the current branch with the suggested upstream branch.

The current implementation has a bug in the handling of multiple occurrences of the flags in the command. The code only removes the flag and its argument once, leading to incorrect behavior when there are multiple instances.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the code incorrectly assumes that there will be at most one occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command. When there are multiple occurrences, the code only removes the first occurrence and its argument, which leads to an incorrect final command.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should iterate over the script parts to find and remove all occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and their corresponding arguments. This will ensure that all instances of the flags are properly handled.

### Corrected Function
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # find and remove all occurrences of --set-upstream or -u
    while '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the argument
        
    while '-u' in command.script_parts:
        option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle all instances of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags correctly, leading to the expected behavior in all test cases.
