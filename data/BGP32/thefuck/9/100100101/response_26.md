### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument, then replacing the 'push' argument with the currently configured upstream branch. However, the bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument.

### Bug
The bug lies in the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument. The script parts removal logic is flawed as it pops the elements at the same index twice, resulting in incorrect modifications to the command.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument from the command script parts. We should find the index of the flag first, then remove both the flag and its argument once.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the argument as well
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the function should correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument and return the modified git push command.
