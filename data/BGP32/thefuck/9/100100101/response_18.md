The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` lies in the handling of the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the `command.script_parts` list, as well as the extraction of the correct push command from `command.stderr`.

The main issues are:
1. Only the last occurrence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is removed from the `command.script_parts` list, not all occurrences.
2. The extraction of the push command from `command.stderr` is not robust and relies on splitting the string by newlines, which can be problematic if the error message format changes.

To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Remove all occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Use a more reliable method to extract the push command from `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove all occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    command.script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    # Extract the push command from stderr
    push_command = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_command = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return 'git ' + push_command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle multiple occurrences of the options to be removed and extract the push command in a more robust way. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
