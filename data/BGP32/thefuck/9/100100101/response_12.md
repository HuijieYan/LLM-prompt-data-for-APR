After analyzing the provided code and the failing test, the bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect logic used to handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command. The issue lies in the way the upstream option index is being handled: attempting to find both `--set-upstream` and `-u` indices independently and then directly removing elements from the script parts list.

The bug causes the function to sometimes remove the wrong elements from the `script_parts` list, leading to incorrect command construction.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the removal of the upstream option by looking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` indices separately, removing them correctly.
2. Ensure the correct extraction of `push_upstream` from the stderr message by parsing the correct part of the message.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.rules.utils import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream and -u options
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    # Remove the found indices from script_parts
    new_script_parts = [part for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if i not in upstream_option_indices]

    # Get the push_upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()

    # Construct the new command
    new_command = ' '.join(new_script_parts)
    new_command = replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return new_command
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases by correctly handling the removal of the upstream option and constructing the new command.
