### Analysis
The buggy function is trying to extract the upstream branch information from the stderr of a git push command. It also attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument if present in the command.

The potential error location is when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. The code currently tries to remove the option twice without considering if it was successfully found in the list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. The code does not check if the option actually exists in the list before trying to remove it. Additionally, the function incorrectly calculates the index to remove the option from.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove it.
2. Update the calculation of the index to remove the option to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these changes, the function should now correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and successfully extract the push upstream information from the stderr. It should pass all the failing test cases as well.
