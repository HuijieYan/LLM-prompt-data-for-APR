## Analysis
The buggy function aims to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments and replacing the "push" part with the suggested push command from git. The issues in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect logic for removing the flags and their arguments.
2. Incorrect extraction of the suggested push command from the stderr.

## Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function, the errors are primarily related to the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their respective arguments. The buggy function is trying to remove these flags from the `command.script_parts` list, but the removal logic is faulty. The implementation is attempting to remove the respective flag and its corresponding argument by calling `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice, which leads to removing only the flag itself, not the argument.

Additionally, the extraction of the suggested push command from `command.stderr` is incorrect. The buggy function is hardcoded to extract the suggested command by splitting the `stderr` string and taking the substring starting from the third line from the end, which may not always work correctly if the error message format changes.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument.
2. Modify the extraction logic for the suggested push command to make it more robust and reliable even if the format of the error message changes.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Identify the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Remove the flag and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract the suggested push command
    push_upstream = ''
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n')[::-1]:
        if line.strip().startswith('git '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split('git ')[1]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function addresses both issues by correctly removing the flag and its argument and by dynamically extracting the suggested push command from the `stderr` message. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
