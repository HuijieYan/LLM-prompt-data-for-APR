### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is located in the logic to handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option within the input command. The issue arises because the code is incorrectly handling the removal of these options from the `script_parts` list. When attempting to remove the option and its argument, the code is performing the removal operation twice, which causes the script to become incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `script_parts` list in a way that ensures it is only removed once. Additionally, we need to handle the scenario when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found in the input command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    up_option = '--set-upstream'
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(up_option)
    except ValueError:
        up_option = '-u'
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(up_option)
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument are removed only once if present in the input command. Additionally, the function now correctly handles scenarios when these options are not found in the command.
