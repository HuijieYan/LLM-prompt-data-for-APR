### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands by removing --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments from the command and appending the correct push upstream value. 

#### Issues:
1. The code uses two separate try-except blocks to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u', but it only updates the `upstream_option_index` once. This leads to the incorrect removal of the option and its argument.
2. The pop method is called twice on `command.script_parts` without checking if the index is valid, which can cause index out of range errors.
3. The calculation of `push_upstream` seems to be flawed as it directly processes the stderr message without proper validation.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the --set-upstream or -u flags and their arguments. Due to the flawed logic in populating `upstream_option_index` and directly processing the stderr message for `push_upstream`, the function often returns unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that `upstream_option_index` is correctly updated by handling both '--set-upstream' and '-u' cases properly.
2. Validate the index before using the pop method on `command.script_parts`.
3. Improve the logic to extract correct `push_upstream` value from the stderr message.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Copy to avoid modifying the original list

    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(script_parts):  # Ensure there is another argument to remove
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract the correct push upstream value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('.\n')[-2].partition('git ')[2].strip()

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Note:
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned and should now handle the input cases correctly based on the provided information. Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to confirm its functionality.
