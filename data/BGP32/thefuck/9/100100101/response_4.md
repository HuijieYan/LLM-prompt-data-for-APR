### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command passed, then extract the suggested push command from the stderr and replace the `push` command with it in the original command. However, there are a few issues causing the function to fail:
1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` is incorrect as it uses two separate try-except blocks without checking if the index is already found.
2. Removing the `--set-upstream` argument is not done correctly, leading to potential index errors.
3. The extraction of the suggested push command from stderr is done incorrectly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs, we need to:
1. Find the proper index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script parts.
2. If the index is found, correctly remove the flag and its argument from the script parts.
3. Correctly parse the suggested push command from the stderr to use in the new command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u flag
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if flag in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            break
        
    # Remove the flag and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract the suggested push command from stderr
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues and pass the failing test cases provided.
