The bug in the provided function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is being handled. The function incorrectly removes the upstream option and its argument using the value of `upstream_option_index`. The issue arises when the index for `-u` is found after `--set-upstream`, leading to the removal of the wrong index from `command.script_parts`.

To fix this bug, we need to address the following:
1. Ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are checked, and their corresponding indices are correctly handled.
2. After finding the correct index, remove the option and its argument properly from the `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    for index in upstream_option_indices:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        # Remove the argument if it exists
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and remove them along with their arguments from `command.script_parts`. This change should satisfy all the given test cases and their expected input/output values.
