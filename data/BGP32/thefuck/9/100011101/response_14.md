### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the list of script parts in the `Command` object. When the `-u` option is present, it is correctly identified in the script parts, but removing it causes an `IndexError` because the script parts list is modified while iterating through it. This leads to unexpected behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should avoid modifying the list while iterating through it. Instead, we can store the indices of the `-u` option when found and then remove them at the end. This approach will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing '--set-upstream', the next part is the argument, also remove it
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing '-u', the next part is the argument, also remove it
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the function to store the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and then removing them after iterating through the script parts, we prevent the `IndexError` and ensure proper handling of the command.
