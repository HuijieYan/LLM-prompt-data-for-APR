### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when iterating over the script parts of the command, if the `-u` flag is found, the index of that flag is stored in `upstream_option_index`. However, in the subsequent block of code, the script parts are manipulated incorrectly. When `upstream_option_index` is not -1 (meaning the flag was found), the code removes the element at `upstream_option_index`, which is the flag itself, and then tries to remove the element at the same index again, which at this point refers to an index that is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the removal of the elements after finding the `-u` flag. Specifically, the code should remove the flag and the subsequent element (the argument to the flag) if the flag is found.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

After making this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `-u` flag and its argument, removing both if present, and continue to generate the correct new command.
