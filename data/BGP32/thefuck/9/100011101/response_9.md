### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is due to how the `upstream_option_index` is being handled. The issue arises when `-u` is not found in the `command.script_parts` list, which results in a fallback value of -1 for `upstream_option_index`. This then leads to an incorrect usage of `pop()` method to remove the element when `upstream_option_index` is -1, causing the `IndexError: pop index out of range` during the function execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `-u` is not found in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove the element. This can be done by properly checking the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and only executing the removal logic if the index is valid (not -1).

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the modified logic above, the function will correctly handle cases where `-u` is not found in `command.script_parts`, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
