## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to the way the `upstream_option_index` variable is updated. The function first looks for the index of `'--set-upstream'` in the `command.script_parts` list, but then overrides the value of `upstream_option_index` with the index of `'-u'`. This causes an issue when trying to remove the elements at the index found, as it might not be correct.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle both cases of finding either `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and then using the correct index for removal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both cases of finding `--set-upstream` or `-u` correctly and remove the correct element from the `command.script_parts` list, resolving the bug.
