### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `-u` option is present in the script parts, the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of `-u`. However, later when `-u` is removed, the index is no longer valid as the list shrinks.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to adapt the logic after removing the `-u` option by adjusting the index accordingly. We can set the `upstream_option_index` to -1 after removing the option since it will be an invalid index.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now handle cases where the `-u` option is present in the script parts correctly.
