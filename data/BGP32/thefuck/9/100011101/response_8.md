## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and extract the remote and branch information after an error message occurs. Based on the error message and failing test, it appears that the function is not handling the case where `-u` is present correctly. The function is erroneously popping two elements instead of just one when `-u` is used, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
When the `-u` option is present in the command, the function incorrectly removes it twice, causing an `IndexError` due to accessing a non-existent index in the list.

## Fix
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic to pop only one element when `-u` is present in the command.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, when the `-u` option is present, only one element will be removed from the `command.script_parts` list, fixing the `IndexError` in the function.
