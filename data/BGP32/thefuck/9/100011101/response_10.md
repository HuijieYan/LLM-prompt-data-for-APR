### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function arises from how the `upstream_option_index` variable is being handled in the code. The issue is that the `pop` method is called twice consecutively after finding the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. When the `-u` option is found, the index is set correctly, but then it is overwritten if the `--set-upstream` option is not found due to the second try-except block.

This leads to the point where `upstream_option_index` holds the value of the last search, which can be -1 if neither option is present. When `-1` is used as an index to pop the elements from `command.script_parts`, it results in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace the second try-except block with an `elif` condition to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is only set to `-u` if it has not already been set to `--set-upstream`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Only replace if not already set
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
