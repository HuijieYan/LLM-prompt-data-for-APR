The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by an incorrect handling of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command script parts.

1. The function does not correctly handle the case when the `-u` option is present in the command.
2. The removal of the option and its argument is not handled properly, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop from the script parts.
3. The function does not account for the fact that the upstream branch might contain spaces, which affects the extraction of the push upstream from the error message.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Consider both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options when removing them from the command script parts.
2. Ensure that the pop operation is safe by checking the length of the script parts.
3. Adjust the extraction of the push upstream from the error message to handle cases where the branch name contains spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle the removal of the `-u` option properly and avoid the `IndexError` by checking the length of `script_parts`. It also accounts for spaces in the branch name when extracting the push upstream value.
