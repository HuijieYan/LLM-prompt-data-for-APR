The bug in the function arises due to incorrect handling of the index when attempting to pop elements from the script_parts list. If the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is present, the function should be removing it and its argument from the list. However, the current implementation is attempting to pop twice at the same index, which leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that only one pop operation is performed at the correct index. Additionally, a check for the presence of the options should be done separately to handle both cases accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' separately and removes them at the correct index. This fix should now correctly handle the provided test cases and pass the failing tests.
