### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the way it tries to remove arguments `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts`. The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. When both options are present, the index of `-u` is found after searching for `--set-upstream`, and then the same index is used to remove `-u` from `command.script_parts`, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, an additional conditional check should be added to ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are handled correctly when both are present. If both options are in the `command.script_parts`, they should be removed in two separate operations to avoid misalignment of indices.

### The corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments separately
    commands_to_remove = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for cmd in commands_to_remove:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(cmd)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            if cmd == '-u':
                option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')  # In the case both -u and --set-upstream are present
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

This corrected version will ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are handled correctly and removed from the `command.script_parts` when they are present.
