Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the runtime input/output variable values, the expected input/output variable values.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

## Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`



## Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution
