### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs due to an incorrect handling of the index for removing the `-u` option when it exists in the `command.script_parts` list. The bug leads to an `IndexError` when the pop operation is performed on the list `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index for the `-u` option is used when popping it from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we should make sure that the relevant part of the `stderr` message is extracted correctly to generate the desired `push_upstream` value.

### Corrected Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('--set-upstream ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now be able to handle both cases where `-u` or `--set-upstream` options are present, and correctly extract the upstream branch to form the new command.
