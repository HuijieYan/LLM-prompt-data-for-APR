### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands, specifically focusing on removing --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments. The bug occurs when trying to remove the specified index from the list `command.script_parts`. The error message suggests an "IndexError: pop index out of range", indicating that the index being removed is out of bounds.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the attempt to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`. If the index is found in both cases where --set-upstream or -u is present, the second try to remove that same index causes the index to be out of range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for removing the found index only once instead of trying to pop it twice. Additionally, the index should be corrected if both --set-upstream and -u options are present.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in `command.script_parts` separately. It also makes sure to pop the index from the list only once, along with its argument.
