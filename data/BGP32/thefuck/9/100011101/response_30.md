The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present in the command, then extract the necessary push information from the stderr output and construct a new command. 

The error message points to an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` twice at the same `upstream_option_index`, leading to the index becoming out of range when the second `pop` operation is executed.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the case where the `-u` option is present in the command, adjust the index accordingly, and ensure that popping elements from the list does not lead to index out of range issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto 
    # the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    options_to_remove = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in options_to_remove:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, preventing the index out of range issue. It should now pass the failing test case provided.
