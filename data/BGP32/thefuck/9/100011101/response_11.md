### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the index removal when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the command script parts. The buggy function attempts to remove the found index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when the index goes out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly remove the index of the found `--set-upstream` or `-u` option only once. We should update the index removal process to ensure that it is done safely without going out of range.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary
The bug was fixed by updating the index removal logic to correctly remove the found index only once, avoiding the `IndexError` that occurred in the buggy function. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
