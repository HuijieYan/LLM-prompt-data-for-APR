### Bug Explanation
The buggy function currently has an issue with removing the `-u` flag from the `command.script_parts` list. The function incorrectly performs the removal by modifying the list based on an index that is specific to the `--set-upstream` flag, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to remove the `-u` flag.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should first check for the presence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`. If found, it should remove the flag along with its subsequent argument. Additionally, the function should extract the argument to be concatenated with the new `git push` command. 

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected function properly handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags with their respective arguments and concatenates the correct argument to the `git push` command. This version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
