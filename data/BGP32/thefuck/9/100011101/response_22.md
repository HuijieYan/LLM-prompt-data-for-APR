### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the manipulation of the `upstream_option_index` variable, which is initialized to -1 and indicates whether the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command. However, when both checks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` fail, the `upstream_option_index` remains -1. Consequently, when `pop(upstream_option_index)` is called without changing its value, an `IndexError` occurs because -1 is out of the range of valid indices for the list `command.script_parts`. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add validation to properly handle the case when neither `--set-upstream` nor `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by updating the conditional check after both `try-except` blocks to prevent popping an element if `upstream_option_index` is still -1.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks if either of the options (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) is present in the command before attempting to remove them. This ensures that the list `command.script_parts` is not being manipulated incorrectly, preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
