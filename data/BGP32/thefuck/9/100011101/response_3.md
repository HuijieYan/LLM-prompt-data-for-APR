The bug in the provided function arises from manipulating the `command.script_parts` list incorrectly when trying to remove the `-u` option. The code mistakenly tries to pop the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts`.

To fix this bug, we need to make the following adjustments:
1. Properly handle the case when the `-u` flag is not found in the script parts.
2. Only pop the `-u` option once when it is found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_flag = '--set-upstream'
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option_flag)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle cases where the `-u` option is not present and correctly removes it when it is found, addressing the index out of range issue.
