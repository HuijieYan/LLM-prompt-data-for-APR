### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is due to improperly handling the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. When the `-u` option is detected, the function tries to remove the option itself and the corresponding argument. However, if the `-u` option is not present, an IndexError occurs because the function tries to remove elements at positions based on the index of `-u`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly check if the `-u` option is present before trying to remove it and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Ensure that there are still items to pop after removing the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function includes proper checks for the presence of the `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove it. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and ensures that the function behaves correctly for all cases.
