### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs because when the `-u` flag is parsed in the command, it removes both instances of the flag and its argument. This leads to an `IndexError` because it tries to pop an element twice in the case where there is only one occurrence of the `-u` flag.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check the index of `-u`, remove it, and also remove the element following it (the argument). This way, we are correctly handling both scenarios where the `-u` flag is present with or without an argument.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

Now the function should correctly handle both scenarios with or without an argument for the `-u` flag and pass the failing test.
