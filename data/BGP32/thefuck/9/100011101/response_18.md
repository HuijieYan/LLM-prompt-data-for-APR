## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` option and `-u` option, along with their arguments, from the provided `git push` command. It then retrieves the suggested command from the stderr output of the `git push` command and replaces the `push` part with the retrieved command.

The bug occurs when the function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The bug is triggered when trying to pop twice from the `command.script_parts` list, which can cause an IndexError if the index for either option is repeated or out of range.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not found in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we must accurately determine the index of the option to ensure that popping from the list does not lead to an IndexError.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if 0 <= upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

## Summary
The corrected version of the function now accounts for cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option may not be found in the `command.script_parts` list. It also ensures that the removal of the options and their arguments from the list is done safely without causing an IndexError. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function perform as expected with the provided test cases.
