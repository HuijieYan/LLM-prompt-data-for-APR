## Bug Explanation
The bug in the code arises from the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list. When the `-u` option is detected in the script parts, the code tries to remove the `-u` flag from the list. However, after removing the `-u` flag at `upstream_option_index`, the list is modified, which shifts the indexes of subsequent elements. When trying to remove `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` a second time, it references a new index, which may not exist after the previous removal.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` without disrupting the index positions. One approach would be to sort the index removals reversely (start from the end and move towards the beginning) to prevent shifting of elements that may lead to non-existent indexes.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()

    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            option_index = command_parts.index(option)
            command_parts.pop(option_index)
            command_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument too
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments without causing index out of range issues.
