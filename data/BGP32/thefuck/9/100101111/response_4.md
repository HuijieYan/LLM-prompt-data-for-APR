The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to wrongly handling the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. The incorrect removal is causing issues in generating the new command.

### Error Explanation:
The main issue in the current implementation is that after finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, it is being immediately removed. This leads to an incorrect removal of the next argument as well. Additionally, the `push_upstream` value is extracted incorrectly from `command.stderr`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Find and remove the correct index for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option without affecting the next argument.
2. Extract the `push_upstream` value by properly parsing the required string from `command.stderr`.
3. Replace the `push` argument properly without introducing any extra arguments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    # Find the index of upstream option and remove it properly
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index(option)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if upstream_option_index < len(script_parts):
                script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the next argument if present
    
    # Extract the correct push_upstream value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace('git push --', '').strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and generate the correct new command based on the input `command`. It should pass the failing test cases provided and resolve the GitHub issue mentioned.
