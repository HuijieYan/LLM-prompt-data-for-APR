### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is responsible for extracting the push upstream branch suggested by git and replacing the push command in the given input with this suggestion. However, the bug causes issues when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the input command. The bug arises from incorrect removal of these flags causing an offset in the command parts array.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command array. This leads to an incorrect concatenation of the suggested push upstream branch with the input command. In the failing test cases, the bug causes the suggested push command to be appended incorrectly, resulting in failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the command array.
2. Adjust the index handling for accurately extracting the push upstream branch suggestion from the stderr.
3. Reconstruct the new command string by replacing the correct push command with the extracted suggestion.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract git push upstream branch suggestion
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Construct the new command
    new_command = " ".join(script_parts)
    if push_upstream:
        new_command += ' ' + push_upstream

    return new_command
```

Now, with the corrected logic in place, the function should handle the removal of flags correctly and generate the new command string accurately based on the push upstream branch suggestion. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the reported GitHub issue effectively.
