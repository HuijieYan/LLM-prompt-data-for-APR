### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the list of command parts. Additionally, the incorrect extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr message causes the resulting command to be constructed incorrectly, leading to failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command parts list.
2. Extract the correct upstream branch from the stderr message to construct the new command with the correct format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u
    new_parts = []
    found_option = False
    for part in command.script_parts:
        if found_option:
            found_option = False
        elif part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            found_option = True
        else:
            new_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().split()[4] + " " + command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().split()[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above corrections in the function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test cases should now pass successfully.
