### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the command. It attempts to remove these flags and their arguments and then extract the suggested push command from the stderr.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect indexing and removal of the flags and arguments in the `command.script_parts` list, resulting in unexpected behavior.
3. The failing test cases and the observed behavior indicate that the function is not correctly handling the removal of flags and their arguments in all cases. The expected push command is not being constructed accurately.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the flags and their arguments are removed correctly from the `command.script_parts` list and that the push command is constructed properly based on the stderr message.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect indexing and removal of the flags and their arguments in the `command.script_parts` list. The conditions to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are not handled properly. Additionally, the extraction of the push command from `command.stderr` is not accurate.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments from `command.script_parts`.
2. Extract the push command string accurately from `command.stderr` without hardcoding index values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find and remove the --set-upstream or -u flags and their arguments
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(command.script_parts) and command.script_parts[i] != 'git':
                command.script_parts.pop(i)
            break

    # Extract the push command from the stderr message
    extracted_push_command = command.stderr.split('git ')[-1].strip()  # extract the part after 'git' in stderr

    return f"git push {extracted_push_command}"
```

By making these corrections, the function should now accurately handle the removal of flags and their arguments, as well as correctly construct the push command based on the stderr message.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u`.
