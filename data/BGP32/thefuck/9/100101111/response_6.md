### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed to the `git push` command, removing these options and their arguments before suggesting the corrected command.
2. The bug seems to arise from incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable, which is not properly updated when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present.
3. The function fails to correctly detect and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, leading to incorrect suggested commands.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are correctly detected and removed from the command script parts before generating the corrected command.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Update the code to properly handle cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present by checking for both, and removing them along with their arguments.
2. Make sure to adjust the logic for identifying the `upstream_option_index` for both options.
3. Then, concatenate the remaining parts of the command script without the removed options to generate the correct command.

### Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Handle cases where both --set-upstream or -u options are present
    upstream_option_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    if upstream_option_indexes:
        for index in reversed(upstream_option_indexes):  # Remove from the end to prevent index issues
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option and its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the logic to handle multiple occurrences of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, the corrected version of the function should now provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
