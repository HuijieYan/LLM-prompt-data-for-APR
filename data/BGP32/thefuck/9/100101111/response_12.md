### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands and modify them by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, and replace the push command argument with one extracted from the stderr of the command.

The issue seems to stem from how the upstream option removal is handled, potentially causing incorrect modifications to the command script.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The handling of `upstream_option_index` reassignment after the first search might result in the incorrect index value for the `-u` option.
2. When removing the upstream option, the subsequent removal operation may remove the wrong argument, affecting the final resulting command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issues identified, we need to:
1. Ensure correct handling of the index assignment for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. Adjust the removal of arguments closely following the identified index to avoid removing unintended arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    upstream_option_indexes = [index for index, part in enumerate(command_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    for upstream_option_index in upstream_option_indexes:
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we first find all occurrences of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and remove them all from the `command_parts`. This ensures all related options are eliminated. Then, we extract the push upstream argument from the `stderr` as before and construct the new command using `replace_argument`.
