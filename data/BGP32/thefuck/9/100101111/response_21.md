### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding value from the `command.script_parts` list. It then retrieves the suggested command to push upstream from the `command.stderr` and replaces the old push command with the new one. 

The bug arises from how the `upstream_option_index` is handled. When `-u` is present in the command, the value of `upstream_option_index` should be updated to the index of `-u`, but currently, it only gets assigned the index of `-u` (if found) without considering if `--set-upstream` already updated it.

### Bug
In the current implementation, if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command, the index assigned to `upstream_option_index` by `-u` will overwrite the correct index assigned by `--set-upstream`. This leads to the incorrect removal of `-u` and its argument, causing the suggestions to be inaccurate.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `-u` is present in the command, we only consider updating the `upstream_option_index` if it hasn't been set by `--set-upstream` earlier in the process. This can be achieved by checking the initial value of `upstream_option_index` before assigning it the index of `-u`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that if `--set-upstream` has already updated the `upstream_option_index`, then `-u` won't overwrite it, providing the correct suggestions for the `git push` command in varying scenarios.
