### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to process the `git push` command output to suggest a corrected push command with the upstream branch set. The bug occurs in handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments when present in the input. The code attempts to find the index of these arguments and remove them, but there are issues with how this is done. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value seems faulty.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect output due to flawed handling of the upstream arguments removal and the `push_upstream` extraction. The script attempts to remove the found argument index twice and fails to properly determine the `push_upstream` value. This results in incorrect suggestions for the push command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Refactor the logic to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments.
2. Ensure the `push_upstream` extraction is accurate to form the correct final suggestion.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract correct push_upstream command
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-2].split()[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correctly identifying and removing the upstream arguments and extracting the `push_upstream` value from the stderr, this corrected version of the function should now output the expected corrected push command suggestions.
