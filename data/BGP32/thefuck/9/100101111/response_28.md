### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is supposed to modify the input command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments if present. However, the current implementation has a logical error in removing the options and their arguments. The issue occurs because the buggy function incorrectly calculates the `upstream_option_index` when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` are presented in the command's `script_parts`. The buggy function incorrectly removes the options and their arguments, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. We should identify the correct index of the option before removing it from the command's `script_parts`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the index of the options correctly, remove them along with their arguments, and return the modified command string.

By using this corrected version, the tests should pass as expected, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
