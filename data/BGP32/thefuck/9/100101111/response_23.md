### Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle Git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and then extracting the suggested push command from the stderr message.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.
3. The bug causes the function to fail in cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is done correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is in the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The issue can be outlined as follows:
- In each `try` block for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, the index is updated unconditionally, leading to the second check always overwriting the first, resulting in only `-u` being handled correctly.
- After removing the option and its argument, the indexing logic is incorrect for removing the following argument. This could lead to an incorrect command being generated.

### Proposed Fix
1. Remove the second `try` block for identifying the `-u` option index and combine the condition for both cases.
2. Adjust the deletion of arguments to handle both the option and its argument properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index and command.script_parts[upstream_option_index].startswith('origin'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version ensures that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are handled correctly, and the command arguments are removed consistently. This version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases successfully.
