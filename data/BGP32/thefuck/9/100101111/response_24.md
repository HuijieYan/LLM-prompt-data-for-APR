### Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is responsible for handling the `git push` command, specifically removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument if present and constructing a new command with the correct format.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly remove both the flag and its argument, leading to incorrect output commands.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect removal of the flag and its argument without accounting for both cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove both the flag and its argument, then construct the new command with the proper format.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now correctly handle the removal of the flag and its argument, ensuring that the output command is in the correct format as expected in the failing test cases.
