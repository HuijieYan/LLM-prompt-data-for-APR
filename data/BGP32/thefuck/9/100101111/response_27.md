### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function is intended to handle a git push command, looking for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and removing them from the command accordingly. It then retrieves the push upstream information from the stderr of the Command object and constructs a new command with the updated push statement.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the upstream_option_index is being handled when searching for '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Additionally, the pop operation on command.script_parts might be causing issues as well.
3. The bug occurs because the script_parts are modified incorrectly when handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. This leads to incorrect construction of the new command with push upstream information.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly and ensure the rest of the script_parts are used properly to construct the new command.

### Bug Fix
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in script_parts:
            script_parts.remove(option)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making a copy of the script_parts list and using it to handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, we ensure that the original list is unaffected. Then, constructing the new command using the corrected script_parts list provides the expected output.
