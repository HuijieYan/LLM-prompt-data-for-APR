### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the given command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then extracting the correct push command from the stderr output. However, it fails to correctly handle the removal of the option and argument, leading to incorrect outputs.

The failing test aims to verify the behavior of the function with different variations of the `git push` command and assert the expected output. The buggy function fails to produce the correct output in all test cases.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument may not be properly handling all scenarios.
2. Parsing the push command from the stderr output may not be accurate.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs due to incorrect indexing and removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument in the `command.script_parts`. This leads to unexpected behavior when constructing the new command with the correct push command extracted from the stderr output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument are properly removed from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the push command extracted from the stderr should be accurately identified and used to construct the new command.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u with its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract correct push command from stderr
    last_line = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-1]
    push_command = last_line.partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_command)
```

By properly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as accurately extracting the push command from the stderr output, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected outputs for the failing test cases.
