### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the list of script parts. It then extracts the suggested push command from the `stderr` output and replaces the push command with the extracted suggestion.
2. The bug arises from the incorrect removal of the flag and its argument in the script_parts list and the incorrect extraction of the suggested push command from the `stderr`.
3. In the failing test cases, the expected output does not align with the actual output due to a faulty handling of script parts and extracting the correct push command.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function fails to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the command script parts list. As a result, it removes the wrong elements leading to incorrect output.
- The extraction of the suggested push command from the `stderr` output is incorrect, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the script parts list.
2. Correctly extract the suggested push command from the `stderr` output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        # Remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        else:
            return command.script

        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)

        # Extract the suggested push command
        split_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
        for line in reversed(split_lines):
            if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
                push_upstream = line.strip()
                return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    return command.script
```

### Changes Made:
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the script parts list.
2. Improved extraction of the suggested push command from the `stderr` output to ensure the correct value is extracted.

By applying these changes, the function should now properly handle the input cases and provide the expected output.
