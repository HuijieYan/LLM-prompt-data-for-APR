### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process a `Command` object related to a Git push command. It looks for specific flags (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) in the `script_parts` of the command and removes them. Then, it extracts the suggested Git push command from the stderr and replaces the original push command with this suggestion.

The buggy behavior seems to be related to the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable to remove the flags. Additionally, the logic for extracting the suggested push command from `stderr` might need improvement.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function can be explained by the wrong removal of flags based on the calculated `upstream_option_index`. The logic for detecting the presence of `-u` is currently incorrect, causing issues with flag removal. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested push command from `stderr` is not precise, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in `script_parts`.
- Properly adjust the removal of the flag based on the identified index.
- Extract the suggested push command from `stderr` accurately to get a valid replacement suggestion.

### Corrected Function
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function should accurately identify and remove the flag, as well as extract the correct suggested push command from the stderr. This should align with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
