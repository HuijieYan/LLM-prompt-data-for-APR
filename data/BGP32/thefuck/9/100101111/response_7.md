### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is supposed to modify the command script parts based on specific conditions related to git push commands with --set-upstream or -u flags.
2. The bug appears to be related to how the upstream_option_index is handled and how the push_upstream variable is extracted.
3. The bug causes incorrect modification of the command script parts, leading to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves correctly adjusting the upstream_option_index, removing the unnecessary parts from the command script, and extracting the push_upstream value accurately.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('    git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u flags and their arguments, as well as extract the push_upstream value accurately for generating the new command suggestions.
