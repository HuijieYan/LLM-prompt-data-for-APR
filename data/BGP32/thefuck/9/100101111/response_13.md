## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are passed to a `git push` command. It attempts to remove these flags and their argument, then parse the suggested command from the error message to replace the `push` argument with the extracted suggestion.

The issues in the current implementation are:
1. The code does not correctly handle the removal of the inferred `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags.
2. The extraction of the suggested command is brittle because it relies on a fixed position in `stderr` based on assumption.

As a result, the buggy function fails to process the input commands correctly and does not provide the expected suggestions.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation stems from incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags. The function incorrectly removes these flags and their arguments based on arbitrary indices without proper error checking. Additionally, the parsing of the suggested command from the error message is fixed on the assumption that it will always be in the same position, which is not a safe approach.

To fix this bug, the function needs to:
1. Properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags.
2. Implement a stable and accurate method to extract the suggested command from the error message.

## Proposed Fix:
To resolve the buggy behavior, we need to enhance the error handling and parsing logic of the function. Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_flag_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_flag_index = command_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command.script

    # Remove the flag and its argument (if present)
    if len(command_parts) > upstream_flag_index+1:
        command_parts.pop(upstream_flag_index+1)
    command_parts.pop(upstream_flag_index)

    suggested_command = command.stderr.partition('git ')[-1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', suggested_command)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified by properly handling the removal of the flags and implementing a safer method to extract the suggested command.

By updating the function with the provided fix, the failing tests should now pass, and the behavior aligns with the expected output. This fix resolves the reported GitHub issue (#538) as it addresses the incorrect suggestions for `git push -u origin` scenarios.
