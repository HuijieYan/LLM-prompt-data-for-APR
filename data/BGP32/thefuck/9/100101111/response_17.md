### Errors in the Buggy Function:
1. The code does not correctly handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`.
2. The code incorrectly uses `command.script_parts.index` to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, causing issues with removing the options.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to handle the scenario where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. It also tries to remove the values based on the index, causing misalignment in the script_parts list.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and handle the case where both are present appropriately.
2. Instead of directly removing elements using the index, use a different approach to modify the `script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u options and handle both cases
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    # Get the push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the scenarios where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list correctly. It removes each option individually and then constructs the final command using the push_upstream extracted from the stderr. This should resolve the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.
