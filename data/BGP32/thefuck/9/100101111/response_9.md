### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then replace the `push` part of the command with the correct push upstream suggestion.
2. The error location is in removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The bug is caused by incorrectly removing the options and arguments from the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to incorrect suggestions being generated.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the options and their arguments correctly and then retrieve the correct push upstream suggestion.
5. The correction involves properly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and arguments from the `command.script_parts` list by modifying the index handling and pop operation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):

    filtered_parts = []
    skip_next = False

    for part in command.script_parts:
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            skip_next = True
        else:
            filtered_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(filtered_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. It then retrieves the correct push upstream suggestion and replaces the `push` part of the command with this suggestion. This fix should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
