### Analysis
1. The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command. Then it extracts the push command suggested by git from the stderr and replaces the original push command with this updated command.
2. The buggy function encounters an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from `command.script_parts` using `pop()` method.
3. The failing test cases aim to cover scenarios with different input script_parts of the `Command` object and expect the correct push command to be generated.
4. The bug occurs because when removing an element using `pop()`, the same index is used twice after the index has been removed, causing the second pop operation to raise an `IndexError`. A potential fix is to adjust the index accordingly after the first element removal.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that once an element is removed from the list, the index adjustment takes place to avoid operating on the already removed element.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The correction involves updating the index adjustment logic to ensure that the index is recalculated after each element removal. Now the function should be able to handle pop operations without raising an `IndexError`.
