### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to parse a git command and modify it before returning a new command as a string. The function checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the command and removes them along with their arguments. Then, it extracts the suggested git push command from the error message and returns a string with the modified git push command.

The issue arises in the removal of the arguments corresponding to `--set-upstream` or `-u`. The code does not handle removing the argument index correctly, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to `pop` from the `command.script_parts`.

### Potential Error Location
The error occurs in the following lines:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The same index `upstream_option_index` is being used twice, leading to an `IndexError` when the second `pop` operation is executed.

### Bug Explanation
When the test tries to run `assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))`, the `command.script_parts` ends up being `['git', 'push', '-u']`. The buggy function tries to remove both `'-u'` and its corresponding argument by finding the index for `-u` and removing that index twice. This leads to an IndexError when the second `pop` operation tries to remove an index that is out of range, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we only pop the element once by checking if the index is valid before executing the `pop()` operation.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument too

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments correctly, passing all the provided test cases and producing the expected output values.
