## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the input command based on the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and return the updated command. The bug occurs in handling the removal of the found option and its argument from the `script_parts` list.

The error occurs due to directly popping the same index twice when removing the found option and its argument, causing an `IndexError` when the list gets modified after the first pop operation. This leads to incorrect behavior and results in a failing test.

## Bug Cause
When the function tries to remove the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`, it pops the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access out of bounds index after the first pop.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove the option and its argument by popping only once for each. This can be achieved by making sure that the index of the option and its argument are removed separately with correct checks to avoid out of bounds errors.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is still within bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the bug causing the `IndexError` should be resolved, and the function should pass all the previously failing test cases.
