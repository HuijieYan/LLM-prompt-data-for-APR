### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify the `git push` command based on the stderr message received. It tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command and then extract the upstream branch information from the stderr message to replace in the command.

The bug occurs when trying to remove the detected option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. The code tries to pop the item at `upstream_option_index` twice, which may lead to an `IndexError` if the option is `-u` since the same index is overwritten twice in separate try blocks. 

### Bug Explanation
The failing test is with the input `git push -u`, where the `--set-upstream` option should be added to the final output. However, due to the IndexError encountered in the buggy function, the removal of the option and its argument does not work correctly. The buggy function removes the argument successfully but tries to pop the index again, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we can store the found option index as `upstream_option_index` once, and if an option is found, remove it and its argument. This will prevent the `IndexError` that occurs due to multiple attempts of popping the same index.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

After applying this correction, the function should work as intended and pass all the expected test cases.
