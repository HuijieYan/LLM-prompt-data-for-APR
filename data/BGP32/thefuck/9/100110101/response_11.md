### Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. Then, it extracts the suggested command from the `stderr` passed in and replaces the `push` argument with the extracted command.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts`.
3. The failing test cases aim to verify the correct behavior of the function when dealing with different variations of the input command and `stderr` messages.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the removal of options is handled and ensure that the appropriate parts of the command are extracted from the `stderr`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is popping elements from `command.script_parts` without checking the validity of the index, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an index out of range. This issue arises when attempting to pop the same index twice, resulting in reducing the length of the list below the required index for the second pop operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the removal of options more robustly, ensuring that we only consider valid indexes when popping elements from the list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is still within range after pop
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
