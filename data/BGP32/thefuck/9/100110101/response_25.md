## Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command string based on certain conditions related to upstream options in a git command.
2. The function attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and removes it if found.
3. The function then extracts a part of the stderr message passed to it in the `push_upstream` variable and uses it to construct the new command.
4. The error occurs when the function tries to pop an index that does not exist in the `command.script_parts` list.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function tries to pop the same index twice in case an upstream option is found (index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`). When the second pop operation is performed, it throws an `IndexError` because the index that was popped in the first operation is no longer valid.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, adjust the logic so that the index is popped only once for the upstream option found to avoid the issue of accessing an index out of range.

## The Corrected Function
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the function to pop the index only once when an upstream option is found, we ensure that the operation does not try to access an index that is out of range, resolving the `IndexError` issue.
