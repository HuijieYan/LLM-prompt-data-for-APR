### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command entered by the user related to `git push`, specifically removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument if present, and appending a fixed suggested argument to the command.

The bug occurs when the function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` flag and its argument. The issue arises from the incorrect logic used for removing the elements at the `upstream_option_index` position in the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case `test_get_new_command`, specifically for the command `git push -u`, the `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified as `2` (indicating the position of the flag `-u` in the `script_parts` list).
2. When attempting to remove the flag `-u` and its argument using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, the element at index `2` is correctly removed, updating the list to `['git', 'push']`. 
3. However, the subsequent `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` as initially set mistakenly attempts to remove another element from index `2` in the updated list `['git', 'push']`, which results in an `IndexError` since the list now contains only valid indices `0` and `1`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, ensure that after removing the first element at `upstream_option_index`, the subsequent removal should target the same index as before (`upstream_option_index`) since it has been updated by the first removal action.

### Corrected Code
Here we present the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument corresponding to -u
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correctly handling the index removal logic, the function will now remove both the flag `-u` and its argument when necessary, thus preventing the `IndexError` and successfully addressing the bug.
