### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument from the command parts list and then extract the push command suggested by Git from the stderr.
2. The bug occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is not found in the `script_parts` list, leading to an incorrect usage of index in the pop operation.
3. The error message indicates an IndexError occurring in attempting to pop an element using an out-of-range index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is used for popping the elements from the list based on the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.

### Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the index is within bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking if the index is within the bounds of the list before popping the element at that index, we prevent the IndexError that was occurring. This fix ensures that the function will handle cases where the option or argument should be removed correctly.
