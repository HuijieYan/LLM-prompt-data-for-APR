### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument and then replace the 'push' command with the output from the stderr message.
- The buggy function relies on the index method to find the '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list, which results in an `IndexError` if the item is not found.
- The buggy function then uses the last line of the stderr message to extract the correct 'push' command.
- The buggy function fails to handle cases where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not passed, leading to an `IndexError` in one of the test cases.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the index method is being used to find the position of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list, and if either of these options is not present, it results in an `IndexError` since the index is not found.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to find their indices. Additionally, we need to handle the case where these options are not present to prevent the `IndexError`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By checking if the options are present before attempting to remove them, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works as expected.
