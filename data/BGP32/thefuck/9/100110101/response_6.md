## Analysis
The buggy function aims to modify the command passed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments. It then extracts the suggested push command from the last line of the stderr. There are several issues in the function that lead to the IndexError:

1. The pop operation is called in two subsequent lines, increasing the index value each time, which can make the index out of range.
2. The push command extraction from stderr is done incorrectly.

## Bug Explanation
In each case, the buggy function encounters an IndexError. The cause lies in the two successive `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` lines. When the function removes an element from the list, the remaining elements' positions shift. This causes the indexes to be out of date, leading to an attempt to access indexes that are out of range.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we must address the issue of removing the elements from the list. One way to do this is to rearrange the logic to determine the index and remove the elements correctly. Additionally, the extraction of the push command from stderr should be modified.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    updated_command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    try:
        upstream_option_index = updated_command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        updated_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index+1)
        updated_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = updated_command_parts.index('-u')
        updated_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index+1)
        updated_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    revised_command = ' '.join(updated_command_parts)

    # Extract the push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(revised_command, 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the index removals are handled correctly, preventing the IndexError. Additionally, the push command extraction from stderr is adjusted to capture the correct value. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
