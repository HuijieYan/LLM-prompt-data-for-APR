### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a Git push command based on the stderr output. The function is attempting to identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and then extract the Git push command suggested in the stderr to generate the new command.

The bug occurs because when attempting to remove the option and its argument, the function tries to pop the same index again, leading to an `IndexError`. This error happens in cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` exist in the command, and the code pops the same index twice.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test where `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)` is passed to the function, the command includes both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options.
- When the code tries to remove the options using `pop(upstream_option_index)` twice without adjusting the index after the first pop, it leads to an `IndexError`.
- The second attempt to pop the same index causes the list to be shifted, making the index invalid for the second pop operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that once an option and its argument are removed, the index is updated correctly to point to the next element.
- We can achieve this by tracking the number of elements removed as we iterate over the command parts and adjust the index accordingly.

### The Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    for idx in reversed(upstream_option_indexes):
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Justification
- The corrected function iterates over the command parts and identifies indexes of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, storing them as `upstream_option_indexes`.
- It then iterates backwards over these indexes and pops the elements one by one, keeping track of the removals correctly.
- By adjusting the indexes as elements are removed, the corrected function ensures that no `IndexError` occurs when modifying the command.
- The function structure still captures the desired behavior of removing options and constructing the new Git push command based on stderr.
