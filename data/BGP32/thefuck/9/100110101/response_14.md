### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command for a git push operation based on the current branch and upstream tracking branch. It tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command arguments and then generates the new command with the appropriate upstream tracking branch that was suggested in the error message.

The error occurs when the function tries to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list using the same index twice. This leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range, as seen in the failing test case.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the following line:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The function is trying to pop the same index twice which causes an `IndexError` when the index is no longer valid.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the element once after finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Additionally, we should account for scenarios where these options might not be present in the command.

### Revised Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected and fixed version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop only once

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After fixing the bug with the corrected function provided above, the function should pass the failing test cases, generating the correct new command based on the input conditions.
