### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the `command` argument in a specific way based on certain conditions, such as removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The function then extracts relevant information from the `command.stderr` to construct the new command.

The bug in the function is related to an indexing issue when trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts` based on certain conditions.

### Bug Explanation
1. For the failing test case `test_get_new_command`, when the `command` argument is `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)`, the `command.script_parts` list is `['git', 'push', '-u']`.
2. The buggy function tries to find the index of `'-u'` in `command.script_parts`, and when it finds the index, it attempts to remove the element at that index twice.
3. The issue arises because the element is removed twice for the same index, causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from that index the second time.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that each element is removed only once based on the condition. If the element is found, it needs to be removed without attempting to remove it again. This can be achieved by different means, such as adjusting the index handling or using a more suitable method to remove elements based on conditions.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the element only once
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the adjustments described above, the corrected function should now handle the conditions properly and not cause an `IndexError` when removing elements from the list. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and ensure the expected input/output values are met.
