### Identification of Potential Error Locations
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is always initialized to `-1`, which might cause issues when trying to check if the index is `-1` or not.
2. The usage of `pop()` to remove elements from `command.script_parts` could be problematic if the index is out of range.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the provided function arises due to the incorrect handling of index retrieval and popping elements. When the code attempts to remove elements at the index stored in `upstream_option_index`, it causes an `IndexError` if the index is out of range. This leads to the failing test cases observed in the test file.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Initialize `upstream_option_index` to `-1` only once before checking for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options.
2. Check if the index is valid (not equal to `-1`) before attempting to remove elements using `pop()`.
3. If the index is valid, remove the element at that index only once.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check to avoid out-of-range index
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes proper handling of the index and element removal, ensuring that it does not lead to an `IndexError`. This version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
