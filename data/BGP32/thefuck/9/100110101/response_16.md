### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is intended to handle the `git push` command and modify it based on the specific error message received.
2. The function tries to identify the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the command and removes them if present. Then, it extracts the suggested command to push upstream from the error message.
3. The bug occurs when checking for the index of the flag and the subsequent pop operation on the script parts list. The index obtained is being used twice leading to an index out of range error.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for removing the flag and its argument needs to be corrected to handle cases where the flag is found and is not found in the script parts.

### Bug:
The bug stems from the repeated use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` after the first usage of it. This leads to an `IndexError`, as the index `upstream_option_index` is already popped in the first occurrence itself.

### Fix:
Modify the logic to handle the cases when the flag is found, remove it and its argument only once. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if argument is present
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
