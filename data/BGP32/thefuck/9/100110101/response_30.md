### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by extracting the push destination from the stderr message in the command. The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is being updated and how the upstream argument is being extracted from the stderr message.

1. The bug occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of `'-u'`, which removes that index as well as the next item (`'-u'` and its argument) when popped. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an already removed index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to:
- Check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately.
- Update the extraction logic of the `push_upstream` to get the correct argument without removing or modifying any elements of the `command.script_parts`.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    try:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly extract the push destination without removing unnecessary elements from the `command.script_parts`. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
