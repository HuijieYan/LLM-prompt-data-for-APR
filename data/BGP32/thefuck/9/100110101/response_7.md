## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command based on the stderr output from a git push command. It is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command and add the correct upstream branch and remote.

The bug occurs when trying to remove the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Depending on which flag is present in the command, it incorrectly removes the element at the same index twice.

In the failing test, when `git push -u` is passed, the function incorrectly accesses and alters the `script_parts` list. This results in an `IndexError` since the index exceeds the length of the list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the found index once and handle the case where the flag is not present correctly to avoid the `IndexError`. We can achieve this by checking if the index is valid before attempting to remove the element.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if the next element is within bounds before removing
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding the condition `upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts)` before removing the element, we ensure that the index is within bounds before attempting to remove the element. This fix prevents the IndexError in cases where the flag's argument is the last element in the list.
