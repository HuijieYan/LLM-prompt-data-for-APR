### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify the input command string by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments. It then extracts the command to be pushed upstream from the stderr. The issue arises from an incorrect double pop operation on the `command.script_parts` list when the option index is found.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` followed by `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. When `upstream_option_index` is found, the first pop operation shortens the list, resulting in an incorrect index for the second pop operation. As a result, it raises an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only pop once from the list to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument. We also need to handle the case when the flag and its argument are not present in the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git
    upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By removing the second pop operation in the corrected function, the function should now handle the input cases correctly without causing an `IndexError`.
