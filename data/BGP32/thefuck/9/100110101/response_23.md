## Analyzing the Bug
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a Git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument along with its parameter and replace the command with the suggestion provided by Git. The bug arises from how the indices are handled when trying to remove the upstream options.

### Bug Identification
1. The bug occurs when trying to remove the upstream option from the list `command.script_parts`.
2. The `pop` method is being called twice on the same index, which is the culprit for the `IndexError`.
3. The buggy function is unable to handle cases when the `-u` option is present in the `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Explanation
1. When the `-u` flag is included in the command, the function correctly finds the index of `-u`.
2. However, after removing the element at the index of `-u`, it tries to remove the next element, which leads to an `IndexError` due to the list being modified.
3. This results in the function failing for cases where the `-u` option is included.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the removal of the upstream option by considering the cases where `-u` and `--set-upstream` are present in the command script parts. By ensuring that the index adjustment is appropriate after an element is removed, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. Additionally, we need to accommodate the different scenarios where the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are combined with other arguments in the command.

## Bug Fix and Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By iterating over both possible options (`--set-upstream` and `-u`) and handling their removal correctly, the corrected version ensures that the command modification retains the expected behavior. This fix should address the `IndexError` and make the function handle all test cases effectively.
