### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to manipulate the command parts for a git push command. It searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments in the command and removes them, then constructs a new command with the correct push upstream configuration based on the stderr message provided.

The error occurs when trying to remove the `-u` option from the command if present. The function incorrectly attempts to pop the element at the index twice, causing an `IndexError` when the list gets empty after the first removal.

### Bug
The bug in the code arises from the repeated use of the `pop` method on the same index, removing the element but not updating the index properly. When the index is reused, it points to a wrong position leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of removing the elements corresponding to `-u` in the command. Instead of removing the same element twice, we should remove it once, updating the `upstream_option_index` variable to reflect the correct position for further operations.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now the corrected function should handle the removal of `-u` option correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
