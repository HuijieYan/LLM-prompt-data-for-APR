### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command if present, and then extract the pushed branch information from the `stderr`. The issue seems to be related to incorrectly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option without considering its argument.

### Identified Issues
1. The code does not handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command.
2. Incorrectly removing the argument associated with the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is found in the `command.script_parts`, it directly removes these options from the list without considering the associated argument. This leads to incorrect command transformation where the expected pushed branch information is not extracted.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present and handle them accordingly.
2. Remove not just the options but also their associated argument from the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = script_parts.index(option)
            if len(script_parts) > option_index + 1:
                script_parts.pop(option_index + 1)  # Remove argument
            script_parts.remove(option)  # Remove the option itself
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By implementing the corrections above, the function should now handle both options and their associated arguments correctly, leading to the extraction of the expected pushed branch information.
