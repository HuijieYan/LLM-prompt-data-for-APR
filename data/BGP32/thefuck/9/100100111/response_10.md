The buggy function has a few issues:
1. The logic to determine the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command script is incorrect.
2. The code to remove the option and its argument is invalid.
3. The extraction of the suggested command from the stderr message is not precise.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and get the correct index.
2. Remove the option and its argument correctly.
3. Extract the suggested command accurately from the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('    ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and fulfill the expected input/output values.
