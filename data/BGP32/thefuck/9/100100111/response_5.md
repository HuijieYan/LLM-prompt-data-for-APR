### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments before parsing the command to generate a new command. However, the bug is caused by how the indexes of these options are stored and used. This leads to incorrect indices for removing the options when they are found.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from how the `upstream_option_index` variable is used to store the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts`. When searching for `-u`, if it is not found, the previous `upstream_option_index` value is retained, leading to incorrect removal of the options later on. Additionally, when removing the option and its argument, the same index is used twice, which results in skipping the argument for removal.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that each search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` is distinct and if one option is found, it should not reuse the index from the other search.
2. When removing the options and their arguments, remove the argument first before removing the option to maintain correct index positions post-removal.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = None
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is None:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        arg_index = upstream_option_index + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(arg_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After addressing the indexing issues and ensuring correct removal of options and their arguments, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results mentioned for each scenario.
