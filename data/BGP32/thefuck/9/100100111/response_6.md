### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function aims to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. Then, it fetches the suggestion from the `stderr` output and replaces the `push` with the obtained suggestion.
2. The potential error lies in the handling of finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list, removing them if found, and extracting the suggestion from the error message.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` assignment and removal of the option argument. This leads to an incorrect access to the `push_upstream` value in the return statement.
4. To fix the bug, we need to:
   - Correctly retrieve the indices of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
   - Remove both the option and its argument if found.
   - Extract the correct suggestion from the `stderr` message.
   - Replace the `push` part with the obtained suggestion.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u in command.script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Remove the option and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct suggestion from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace 'push' with the obtained suggestion
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By implementing these corrections, the function should now handle the removal of the option and its argument correctly, as well as extract the suggestion accurately from the error message. This fix should resolve the bug and satisfy all the expected test cases.
