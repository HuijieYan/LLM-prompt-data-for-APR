### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is aiming to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command's script parts. It then extracts the pushed upstream branch from the stderr output and replaces the argument with the actual upstream branch in the new command.
2. The bug lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is updated. The second block should not overwrite the first block's result, leading to incorrect index handling.
3. The current implementation always considers the last occurrence of the `-u` option, which leads to incorrect removal and parsing behaviors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle both cases separately by checking for both options `-u` and `--set-upstream` in the script parts. We also need to handle cases where the pushed branch comes after the options in the script parts.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        try:
            # Check if the next part is not another flag
            int(command.script_parts[upstream_index])
            # Handle the case where the branch comes after the flag
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        except (IndexError, ValueError):
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly handling both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options in the command script parts. It also considers cases where the branch to be pushed comes after the flag in the command.
