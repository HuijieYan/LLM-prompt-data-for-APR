### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for git push by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options if present, and replacing the "push" argument with the suggested push upstream value.
2. The function tries to find the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script parts, and if found, removes them from the script parts. It then extracts the push upstream value from the stderr and replaces the "push" argument with this value.
3. The bug occurs because when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present, the second try block overwrites the index obtained from the first try block. Subsequently, the `pop` operation uses the same index position twice.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options if they are present in the command script parts.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Update the function to correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options if they are present.
2. Utilize a single try block to find the index of either option and then remove both of them if found.
3. Extract the push upstream value as before from stderr and replace the "push" argument with it.

### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the second occurrence
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the `get_new_command` function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and provide the expected behavior in the test cases.
