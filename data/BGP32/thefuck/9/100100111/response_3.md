### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the input command and its argument if present. Then it extracts the relevant information from the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object to construct the new command based on the extracted data.

The potential error locations in the function are the handling of the removal of the flags and their arguments from `command.script_parts` and the extraction of the `push_upstream` information from the `command.stderr`.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect index handling when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments. The buggy function's removal logic does not account for both flags being present in the command, resulting in incorrect behavior. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` does not accurately depict the actual desired output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the removal of both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags and their arguments.
2. Correctly extract the `push_upstream` information from the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their arguments if present
    cmd_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in cmd_parts:
        idx = cmd_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        cmd_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the flag
        if idx < len(cmd_parts) - 1:
            cmd_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the argument
    if '-u' in cmd_parts:
        idx = cmd_parts.index('-u')
        cmd_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the flag
        if idx < len(cmd_parts) - 1:
            cmd_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the argument

    # Extract push_upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(cmd_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these adjustments, the function should now handle multiple occurrences of `-u` or `--set-upstream` flags and their arguments correctly. It also extracts the `push_upstream` information accurately.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values as specified in the cases provided.
