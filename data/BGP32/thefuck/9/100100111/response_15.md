### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments before constructing the final command to be executed.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The usage of `try-except` to search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options might lead to unexpected behavior. If `-u` is found after `--set-upstream`, the index of `-u` will override the previous index of `--set-upstream`.
   - The removal of elements using `pop` based on the index obtained from the above search logic.
   - The assumption made while extracting the desired command from stderr using `partition` might be prone to errors if the format changes.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the issue in handling different cases of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options. The code doesn't properly handle the situation where both options are present or their order is different relative to each other. The function fails to construct the final command correctly leading to incorrect output.
4. To fix the bug, a more robust approach is needed to handle both options distinctly without conflicts even if they appear in a different order. This can be achieved by explicitly traversing through the script parts and maintaining the correctness of the command construction.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    command_index = -1
    upstream_index = -1

    for i, part in enumerate(script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            command_index = i
            if part == '-u':
                upstream_index = i
                break
            upstream_index = i + 1

    if command_index != -1:
        if upstream_index != -1:
            if upstream_index > command_index:
                script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
                script_parts.pop(command_index)
            else:
                script_parts.pop(command_index)
                script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version explicitly handles the uniqueness of `-u` and `--set-upstream`, ensuring that they are processed in the right sequence without any conflicts. Additionally, it constructs the final command accurately by avoiding misplaced removals and considering edge cases.
