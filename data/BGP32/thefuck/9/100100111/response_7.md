### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to process the output of a `git push` command and extract the suggested push command with the necessary `--set-upstream` option. The function looks for occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and removes them, then extracts the push suggestion from the stderr output.

### Identified Error Locations
1. The error seems to be in the manipulation of the `upstream_option_index`, which is incorrectly checked for inequality with `-1` instead of `< 0`.
   
### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect logic of checking `upstream_option_index` against `-1`. Since the intention is to detect whether the option was found (i.e., index greater than 0), the condition should be `upstream_option_index < 0`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition for detecting the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` by changing `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` to `if upstream_option_index >= 0:`.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:  # Fixed condition
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

Applying this fix should address the bug and make the function correctly process the command and return the expected results for the test cases provided.
