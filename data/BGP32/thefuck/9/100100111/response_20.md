### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is designed to handle cases of git push commands where it needs to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command.
2. The function tries to locate the position of these flags in the command's script parts and removes them if found. It then extracts the suggested git push command from the stderr message.
3. The bug seems to arise from the incorrect manipulation of the script parts after removing the flag and its argument.
4. The failing test cases suggest that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the flags and generating the new command.
5. The fix needs to ensure proper handling of the removal of flags and accurate extraction of the suggested git push command from the stderr message.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect manipulation of script parts after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument. This leads to discrepancies in generating the new git push command.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the script parts.
2. Extract the suggested git push command accurately from the stderr message.
3. Ensure that the script parts are updated with the extracted command to generate the correct new command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        flag_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        flag_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        flag_index = -1
    
    if flag_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures the proper removal of the flags and arguments, as well as accurate extraction of the suggested git push command from the stderr message.
