### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to process the output of a `git push` command and adjust the command based on a specific error message it expects. The buggy function looks for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the command and removes it along with its argument. It then extracts the suggested command from the error message and replaces the `push` argument with it.

### Issues
1. The logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is incorrect. The code removes the flag and its argument in a way that may lead to index errors.
2. The extraction of the suggested command from the error message is problematic.
3. The logic for replacing the `push` argument with the suggested command needs adjustment to handle different scenarios.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the program to fail in properly extracting the suggested command when the `-u` flag is present with an additional argument. This leads to incorrect replacements and error conditions.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag with its argument.
2. Extract the correct suggested command from the error message.
3. Enhance the logic for replacing the `push` argument with the suggested command to meet expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            upstream_option_index = i
            break

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip().split('--set-upstream ')[-1]
    return " ".join(command.script_parts).replace('push', push_upstream)
```

Now, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issues reported in the GitHub bug.
