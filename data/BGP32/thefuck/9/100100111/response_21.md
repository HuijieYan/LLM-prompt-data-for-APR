### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` specifically deals with retrieving a new command based on the `stderr` output of a git push command.
2. The function locates the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command's script parts and removes it along with its argument if found. It then extracts the push command from the `stderr` and replaces the `push` argument with it in the original command.
3. The bug likely occurs due to improper manipulation of the `upstream_option_index` variable, leading to incorrect removal of elements from `script_parts`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both potential option indexes are checked, and only the correct index is used for removal. Additionally, the extraction of the push command from `stderr` needs to be accurate.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect removal of elements from `script_parts` when extracting the push command.
- In cases where the option to remove is found at index `0`, the subsequent removal at the same index causes an issue.
- This leads to incorrect command modification and mismatch with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and determine the correct index for removal based on which option is present.
2. Extract the push command more reliably from the `stderr` without relying on a fixed position.
3. Adjust the logic to remove the correct element(s) from `script_parts` to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indexes = []
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_indexes.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_indexes.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))

    if upstream_option_indexes:
        for index in upstream_option_indexes:
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_command_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ', 1)
    push_upstream = push_command_parts[-1] if push_command_parts else ''

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

Now, the corrected version of the function should handle the removal of options properly and extract the push command accurately from the stderr based on its position. This should align the function with the expected behavior and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
