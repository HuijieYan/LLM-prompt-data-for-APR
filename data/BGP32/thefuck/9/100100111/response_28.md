### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to modify the user's input of `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its corresponding argument if present in the command. It then extracts the suggested command from `stderr` and replaces the argument of `push` with it. The function is failing to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the input command.

### Error Cause
The bug in the function is that it uses two separate `try` blocks without checking if the `upstream_option_index` was already updated in the first `try` block. So if `-u` is present but `--set-upstream` is not, the function will still overwrite the `upstream_option_index` set by the first `try` block. This leads to losing the index of the option intended for removal.

### Fix Strategy
1. Remove the individual `try` blocks and use a single `try` block to handle both cases.
2. Adjust the logic to properly pop the items at the correct index when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function will handle both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` properly and adjust the `upstream_option_index` accordingly. This should ensure that the function works as expected in all scenarios.
