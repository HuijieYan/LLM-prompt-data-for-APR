### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push command suggestions when a specific error message is encountered.
2. The function looks for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command script, removes them, and then extracts the corrected command from the error message.
3. The bug seems to be related to erroneous removal of the options '--set-upstream' or '-u' from the command script.
4. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly.
5. The expected behavior is to remove these options if they exist in the command script before forming the corrected command.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command script. The function fails to correctly determine the index of these options in the list of script parts and to remove them properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly identify the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and remove them from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Extract the corrected command by parsing the error message `command.stderr` to get the desired push command.
3. Ensure that the function forms the corrected command by replacing the 'push' argument with the extracted push command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u options if present in the command script
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above changes to the `get_new_command` function, it should now correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and generate the corrected git push command based on the error message. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
