### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and its argument. It then retrieves the suggested git push command from the stderr and replaces the `push` argument with this suggested command.
2. One potential error location is the handling of `upstream_option_index`, which might not be correctly updated if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present.
3. The bug arises due to the incorrect removal of the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This causes issues when extracting the suggested git push command from stderr and replacing the argument.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, handle cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle the above scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_short_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_short_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_short_option_index != -1:
        i = upstream_short_option_index
        # Remove both -u and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(i)
        command.script_parts.pop(i)
    elif upstream_option_index != -1:
        i = upstream_option_index
        # Remove --set-upstream and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(i)
        command.script_parts.pop(i)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the function to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, the bug is fixed. This corrected version ensures that the options and their arguments are removed from the `command.script_parts` list, allowing for successful extraction and replacement of the git push command.
