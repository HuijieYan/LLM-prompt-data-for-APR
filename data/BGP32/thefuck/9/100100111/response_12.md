### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to handle git push commands with --set-upstream or -u flags. The buggy function searches for these flags in the command arguments, removes them along with their arguments, and then appends the suggested push command obtained from the stderr message.

The issue mentions that command suggestions for `git push -u myfork` are incorrect, indicating a bug in handling such cases.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `-u` flag in the git push command. The buggy function incorrectly removes the `-u` flag from the command without considering its position and argument.

The buggy logic to remove the `-u` flag:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

The bug lies in the above code segment, where both the flag and its argument are removed separately, leading to incorrect parsing.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case `test_get_new_command`, when the command is `git push -u`, the buggy function incorrectly removes the `-u` flag and its position, causing an issue in constructing the new command.
2. This prompts the buggy function to suggest an incorrect output missing the necessary arguments, failing to produce the expected command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around handling the `-u` flag specifically. The buggy function should correctly identify and process the `-u` flag and its argument as a single entity when modifying the command.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag along with their argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index_of_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index_of_u)
        if len(command.script_parts) > index_of_u:  # Ensure there is an argument after -u
            command.script_parts.pop(index_of_u)  # Remove the argument after -u

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Changes Made
1. Modified the logic to correctly handle the `-u` flag and its argument.
2. Search for `-u` flag in `command.script_parts` and extract the correct command by the position of `-u`.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the `-u` flag correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
