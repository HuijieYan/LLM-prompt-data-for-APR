### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to process the output from a `git push` command and manipulate the command string accordingly. It specifically removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument since these are already included in the message from Git. Then it extracts the necessary information for reconstructing the command using the output message.
   
2. The potential error locations are:
   - The conditions for checking the existence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are implemented incorrectly.
   - Incorrect indexing and popping of elements from `command.script_parts`.
   - The extraction of the push upstream information from `command.stderr` is error-prone.

### Bug Explanation:
The main cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the upstream option removal and the extraction of the push upstream information. The current implementation does not accurately identify and handle the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command string, leading to incorrect popping of elements. Additionally, the extraction of the push upstream information from `command.stderr` may not always work as expected, resulting in incorrect suggestions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
2. Refactor the code to accurately manage the `command.script_parts` list, ensuring correct indexing and popping of elements.
3. Validate the extraction of the push upstream information from `command.stderr` to provide accurate suggestions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if an argument follows the option
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues, ensuring accurate removal of upstream options and proper handling of the `command.script_parts` list. It maintains the extraction of the push upstream information for constructing the new command string.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output values as specified in the test cases and GitHub issues.
