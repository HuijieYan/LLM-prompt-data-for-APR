### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command for pushing upstream in Git by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command script parts. It then extracts the suggested git command from the stderr and replaces the `push` argument with the extracted value.
2. The potential error lies in how the script handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument.
3. The bug occurs because the script incorrectly removes the element at the found index twice, causing the script parts to shift incorrectly. This results in incorrect extraction of the push command from the stderr.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing the flag and its argument from the command script parts.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    upstream_option = '-u'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly, ensuring that the script parts are adjusted accurately before extracting the suggested push command from the stderr.
