### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` handles the `git push` command and is supposed to modify the command based on the error message in the stderr to suggest the correct `git push` command with `--set-upstream origin master`. The bug occurs as it incorrectly handles removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command script parts.

### Identified Error Location
The location where the bug occurs is in the condition where the `upstream_option_index` is checked for `-1` incorrectly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the function to not remove the `-u` flag properly from the `script_parts`, leading to incorrect suggestions. This is evident from the failing test cases and the expected variable values for different inputs.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, when removing the `-u` flag, we need to update the index correctly. Also, errored messages should be handled properly by identifying `origin master` to create the new command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Get the correct `origin master` message from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version, it should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
