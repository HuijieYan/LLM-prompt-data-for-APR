### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `get_new_command`, is intended to modify the `command.script_parts` list by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present. It then extracts the desired push command from the `command.stderr` for use in constructing the new command.
2. The potential error locations are:
   - Incorrect usage of the `pop` method to remove elements from the `script_parts` list.
   - Incorrectly defining the `push_upstream` variable by extracting the desired push command from the wrong part of the `command.stderr`.
3. The bug arises due to the incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list elements while trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and the associated argument. Additionally, the extraction of the desired push command from the `command.stderr` string is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug:
   - Correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `script_parts` list.
   - Extract the desired push command from the correct position in the `command.stderr` string to obtain the correct result.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct elements are removed from the `script_parts` list and extracts the desired push command from the correct position in the `command.stderr` to generate the new command accurately.
