The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` flag and its argument `-u` from the command if they are present. Then, it extracts the suggested git push command from the stderr of the `command` object and replaces the argument with the extracted suggestion.

There are a few potential error locations in the code snippet provided:
1. When searching for the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, it might incorrectly override the value of `upstream_option_index` if the second search is successful.
2. The pop operations after finding the index will remove elements from the `script_parts` list, potentially causing issues with the subsequent command construction.

The bug stems from the fact that once the `command.script_parts` list is modified by removing elements using `pop`, the index positions no longer correspond accurately to the original command. Additionally, the desired push upstream suggestion is extracted from the `stderr` based on assumptions about its position in the split list, which may not always work as expected.

To fix the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Use the conditional statements to check and remove the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately, ensuring that the proper index is removed without overlap.
2. Instead of assuming the position of the git suggestion in the `stderr`, find it based on known keywords like `'use'` and `'git push'`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function `get_new_command`:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream flag if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    # Remove the -u flag if present
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Find the push upstream suggestion in stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'use' in line and 'git push' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split('use')[-1].strip()
            break
    else:
        # Fallback if suggestion not found
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should properly handle the removal of flags from the command and extract the git push suggestion from the stderr based on recognizable patterns. The function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values provided.
