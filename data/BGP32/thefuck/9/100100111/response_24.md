### Analysis:
1. The buggy function aims to modify a git push command to remove any `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and its argument, then replace the 'push' command with the branch name suggested by git. 
2. The potential error locations can be in finding and removing the upstream options from the command, specifically popping elements from the command parts.
3. The bug arises because the code is popping elements from `command.script_parts` twice when an upstream option is found, which leads to an INDEX error. The expected output should contain the correct branch name suggested by git without the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of upstream options correctly without causing an index error and then replace the 'push' command with the suggested branch name.
5. The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find and remove the upstream options if present
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    # Get the suggested branch name from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-2:]

    return f"git push {' '.join(push_upstream)}"
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output with the suggested branch name by git.
