### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command and replacing the `push` argument with the output obtained from the `stderr` message. The code currently has a bug where it attempts to remove the specified flag and its argument but fails to do so correctly. This results in incorrect new command suggestions.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug lies in the logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command. The code currently checks for the index of both flags independently and then tries to remove them using the same index, leading to issues.

### Bug Cause
The main bug occurs because the code attempts to find and remove the same index for both flag `-u` and `--set-upstream`. Due to this, the removal logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect removal or double removal of the values from the `command.script_parts`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code should check for both flags separately and ensure that if either flag is found, both the flag and its argument are removed correctly. Additionally, the logic for extracting the correct `push_upstream` value should be reviewed to ensure accurate extraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)      # Remove the flag

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for each flag separately, removes the flag and its argument correctly, and then proceeds to extract the correct `push_upstream` value.

By implementing this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the flags and present the appropriate new suggested command.
