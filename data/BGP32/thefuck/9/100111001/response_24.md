## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and then construct a new command by replacing the `push` argument with the actual push command suggested by git. The bug occurs when trying to remove the identified option from the `command.script_parts` list. The function is attempting to pop twice using the same index, which results in an `IndexError`.

## Bug Explanation
1. The first issue is that when discovering the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, if `-u` is found after `--set-upstream`, the index is updated for `-u` and overwrites the previous index for `--set-upstream`.
2. When trying to remove the identified option from the list, the function mistakenly attempts to pop twice with the same index, leading to the `IndexError` since the list becomes shorter after the first pop operation.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to address both issues mentioned above. We need to keep track of the indexes of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately. Additionally, when popping elements from the list, we need to ensure we only pop once for each index without trying to pop the same index twice.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    # Remove the found option from the list
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if upstream_option_index_u != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)

    # Retrieve the push command suggested by git
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
