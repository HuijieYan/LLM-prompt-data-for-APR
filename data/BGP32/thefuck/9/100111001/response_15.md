### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from incorrectly handling the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. When either of these options is found in the `script_parts` list of the `command` object, the function attempts to remove them by using the `pop` method. However, the function erroneously attempts to remove the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that each found index is only removed once from the `script_parts` list. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that each found index is removed exactly once from the `script_parts` list, avoiding the `IndexError` that occurred in the buggy version.
