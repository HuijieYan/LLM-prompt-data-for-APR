### Explanation:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The first `pop` operation after finding the index removes the option, but the subsequent `pop` operation at the same index causes an `IndexError` because the list has been modified, and the index is no longer valid.

### Fix:
To correct this issue, we should only remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` once and then construct the new command accordingly. Additionally, we should handle both cases (--set-upstream and -u) properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Since we removed the option once, we need to update the index if necessary
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u' or command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '--set-upstream':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
