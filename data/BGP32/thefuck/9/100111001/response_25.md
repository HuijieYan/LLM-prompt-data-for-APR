### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails because when processing the `'-u'` argument, it tries to remove the two elements related to the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list, but the second `pop` operation is causing an `IndexError` since the list length is insufficient after the first `pop`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the second `pop` operation only occurs if there are still elements in the list to remove. Additionally, the logic for removing `'-u'` should account for the case when `'-u'` is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By implementing the corrected version above, the issue with the double `pop` operation is resolved, and the function should now handle the `-u` option correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
