### Bug Reason:
The bug in the function is caused by the misuse of popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list. When the `--set-upstream` option or `-u` option is found, the function tries to remove them and the subsequent argument by popping elements from the list. However, the bug occurs because if `-u` is found after `--set-upstream`, the same index is used to pop elements, which results in an `IndexError` because the list is modified during the first pop operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function should first check for `--set-upstream`, remove it and its argument; then check for `-u`, remove it and its argument. This way, each option and its argument can be safely removed without affecting subsequent operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should resolve the IndexError issue by properly handling the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments.
