### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a Git command by removing certain options and arguments. The issue arises from the logic that tries to remove the options `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command. The bug causes an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element that is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function tries to locate the index of `'--set-upstream'` in `command.script_parts`. If it is not found, then it tries to locate the index of `'-u'`.
2. If either one of them is found, it proceeds to remove that index element from `command.script_parts` twice. This is where the bug lies.
3. Since the second `pop` operation is trying to remove an element at the same index as the first `pop`, if only one of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, the removal is attempted twice, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should only remove the element once, irrespective of whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found. We should check if either option was located and only perform the removal operation once.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the Git command, ensuring that the removal operation is performed only once if either option is found. This fix should address the `IndexError` and make the function behave as intended.
