### Problem Analysis
The main issue in the buggy function is the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` when processing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The function is trying to remove the option from the `script_parts` list when it is found, but there are two problems:
1. The code removes the option twice when found, leading to an IndexError when the list is emptied.
2. The index value retrieved from `command.script_parts.index()` is not properly checked if it actually exists in the list.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)`, the buggy function incorrectly tries to remove the `-u` option from the `script_parts` list twice, causing an IndexError because it was already removed. This behavior leads to the function incorrectly constructing the new command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to:
1. Remove the duplicate `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line.
2. Check if the index value `upstream_option_index` is valid before trying to remove the option.
3. Adjust the index if `-u` is found so that we remove both the option and its argument.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        # Adjust the index to remove both the option and its argument
        upstream_option_index += 1
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, providing the expected new command for git pushes.
