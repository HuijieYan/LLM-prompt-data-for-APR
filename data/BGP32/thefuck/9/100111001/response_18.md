### Issue Analysis
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from a list using an index that is out of range. This occurs because the code is not handling the case where the `-u` flag is not present in the `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to check if the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found before trying to remove elements from the `script_parts` list. If the index is not found, we should skip the removal step.

### Updated and Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly handle cases where the `-u` flag is not present in the `command.script_parts`, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. This should allow the function to pass the failing test.
