### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from how the `upstream_option_index` variable is handled when the `-u` option is present in the `command.script_parts`. In the buggy implementation, when the `-u` option is found, the corresponding index is stored in `upstream_option_index`, and then the same index is used twice for popping elements from `command.script_parts`. This causes an `IndexError` since the same index is popped twice, leading to it being out of range after the first pop operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when we find an index for either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, we remove it only once from `command.script_parts` to avoid the `IndexError`. We can achieve this by removing the duplicate `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line from the code.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list without causing an `IndexError`.
