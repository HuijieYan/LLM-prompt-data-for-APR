### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command. The code is trying to pop the same index twice, which results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command. Instead of popping the same index twice, we should only pop it once after identifying the correct index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Assesment
The corrected version of the function fixes the bug by correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command without causing an `IndexError`. This version should pass the failing test cases provided.
