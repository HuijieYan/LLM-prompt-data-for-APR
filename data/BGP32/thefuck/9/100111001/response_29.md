The bug in the provided function occurs because the same index `upstream_option_index` is used for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. The second occurrence of finding `-u` overrides the index found with `--set-upstream`, leading to an incorrect removal operation and causing the `IndexError` when attempting to pop the same index twice.

To fix this bug, we need to handle `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, ensuring that the correct index is removed from `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        # Check if --set-upstream index was not set to avoid overriding it
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Need to update the index after the first pop operation
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct index is removed for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, avoiding the `IndexError` that was encountered previously.
