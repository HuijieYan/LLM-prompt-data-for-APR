### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is failing due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list in the if condition block. The issue lies in the incorrect logic of popping the same index twice within the `if` block.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to pop the element only once if the index is found during the checks for '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Since we are popping the option itself along with its argument, popping it twice results in an IndexError. Therefore, we should adjust the popping logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the popping of the option and its argument correctly, resolving the IndexError and passing the failing tests.
