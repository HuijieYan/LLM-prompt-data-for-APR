### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command. The function attempts to remove both the option and its argument by calling `pop` twice on the same index. However, if the option is `-u`, the index for the argument removal is incorrectly updated after the first removal attempt, causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove an item that is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that after removing the option, we adjust the index accordingly before attempting to remove the associated argument. This adjustment needs to consider that the script parts list will shift elements after the first pop operation, hence requiring a potential decrement of the index. Additionally, we need to address the discrepancy in handling the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

        # Adjust index if the previous option was -u
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) and command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'push':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should handle the removal of the option and its argument correctly and should pass the failing test cases.
