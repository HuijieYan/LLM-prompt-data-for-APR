### Bug Analysis
The primary issue in the buggy function lies in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The code incorrectly sets this variable to -1 initially and then attempts to modify its value based on the presence of specific command arguments ('--set-upstream' or '-u'). However, the logic for updating this index is flawed:

1. The code checks for '--set-upstream' first but does not break after finding it. Therefore, if '-u' is also present, the index ends up being set to the position of '-u', overriding any previous setting.
2. The subsequent lines that attempt to remove the argument and its corresponding value from `command.script_parts` use the same index twice, causing an IndexError if '-u' is found after '--set-upstream'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issues identified, the following changes need to be made:
1. Check for '--set-upstream' first and update the index immediately without continuing to search for other flags.
2. Ensure that if an index is found, it is used for removal operations without modifying it before both removals are complete.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Check for -u after handling --set-upstream
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function retains the logic for removing '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags and their arguments while addressing the index manipulation and removal operations causing the IndexError.
