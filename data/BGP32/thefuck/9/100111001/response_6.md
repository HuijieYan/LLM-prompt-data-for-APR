### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a Git command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing the `push` part of the command with another section retrieved from the error message. The bug occurs when trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`, leading to an `IndexError` as the second pop operation fails due to the reduced size of the list.

### Bug Explanation
1. The first try-except block tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` in the list of command parts. If found, it updates `upstream_option_index` with the index.
2. The second try-except block tries to find the index of `-u` in the list of command parts. If found, it updates `upstream_option_index` again with the index.
3. If `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` (meaning either `--set-upstream` or `-u` was found), two consecutive pop operations are attempted on `command.script_parts`, causing the IndexError if both were found.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to adjust the pop operation by only popping once if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the command. Not popping twice as the current version of the function does.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the pop operation and only popping once when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, we prevent the IndexError and provide the expected corrected behavior for the function.
