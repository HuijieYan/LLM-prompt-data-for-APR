The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the problematic logic used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The incorrect removal and double removal of the found index lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element beyond the available range after the first removal.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust how we remove the identified index from the list. It's essential to remove only once and check the validity of the index before attempting to remove it.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version removes the identified index only once and checks for its validity before removing it to avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring previously. Now, this function should correctly process the input and pass the failing test cases.
