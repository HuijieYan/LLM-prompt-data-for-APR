### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to an incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The function attempts to remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice, which results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the upstream option index is found, it is only removed once from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` by ensuring that the element at the `upstream_option_index` is popped only once.
