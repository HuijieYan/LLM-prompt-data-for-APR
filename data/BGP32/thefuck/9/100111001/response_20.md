### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is attempting to remove an element from `command.script_parts` twice when it finds the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. This leads to an `IndexError` when the second `pop` operation tries to remove an element that does not exist due to the first `pop` operation. 

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to remove the correct element only once. By only popping the element once, we ensure that the index remains valid.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the correct element is removed and should pass the failing tests.
