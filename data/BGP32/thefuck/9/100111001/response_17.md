### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect handling of removing the `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug leads to an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when trying to pop an index that is out of range, causing the function to fail the test.

When the function tries to remove the `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, it only removes the flag correctly but leaves the argument behind. This leads to an inconsistency in the number of elements in the list, causing the subsequent pop operation to reference an index that no longer exists.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the flag and its argument are correctly removed from the `command.script_parts` list when the `-u` flag is present.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Identify the index of the -u flag in the script_parts list
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option = '-u'

        # Find the index of the -u flag and remove it along with its argument
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            
    # Extract the required push upstream information
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Create the new command by replacing the push argument
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now remove both the `-u` flag and its argument correctly, resolving the `IndexError` and passing the failing test cases.
