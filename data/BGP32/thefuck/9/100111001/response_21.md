### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to incorrect usage of the `pop` function on `command.script_parts` list. The code tries to remove an element at the same index twice, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test `test_get_new_command`, when the input `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)` is passed to the `get_new_command` function:
   - The script_parts value is `['git', 'push', '-u']`
   - The command.stderr value contains information about setting the upstream branch: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`
2. The function starts by indexing the '--set-upstream' option or '-u' option in `command.script_parts`. If it finds either of them, it tries to remove it from the list.
3. In this specific case, when the '-u' option is found at index 2 in `command.script_parts`, it removes it. Then in the next line, it tries to remove again at the same index, which doesn't exist anymore, causing an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should only remove the element once from `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by removing the element only once when either '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is found in the script_parts.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from `command.script_parts` only once, resolving the `IndexError`.
