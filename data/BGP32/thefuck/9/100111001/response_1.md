### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument before suggesting a new command by extracting the branch information from the stderr output. However, the bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag twice if it's found, which leads to an `IndexError` because the index is already removed.

### Bug Explanation
1. When the function encounters the `-u` flag at index `upstream_option_index`, it correctly removes it in the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.
2. The next line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` tries to remove the same index again, which causes an `IndexError` since the index is already removed.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug and prevent the `IndexError`, the second `pop` operation should only be executed if the first one is successful. One approach is to adjust the index if the first `pop` operation is successful. Here's how the fix can be implemented:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fix ensures that each flag and its argument are only removed once to avoid the `IndexError` while still achieving the intended behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the function has been provided above. By applying this fix, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
