### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the fact that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list, the second removal attempt is not taking into account that the first removal has modified the list's indices. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the same index again.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update how the indices are handled when removing elements from the `command.script_parts` list. After removing an element at a particular index, we need to adjust the next index accordingly to prevent an `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):  # Remove elements in reverse order to avoid index issues
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the `reversed` function when iterating over the indices to remove in `upstream_option_indices`, we ensure that the removal of elements does not affect the index positions for subsequent removals. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
