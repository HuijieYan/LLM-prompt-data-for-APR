### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding argument from the command script parts. The issue occurs when the `-u` option is present in the command, resulting in the removal of the option without the following argument. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the next element, as the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing both the option and its argument. Instead of directly removing elements by index, we should find the indexes of the options and directly remove the option and its argument in a single step. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the argument follows the option as a separate element.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_short_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_short_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream

        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    if upstream_short_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_option_index)  # Remove -u

        if upstream_short_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### This corrected version of the function should now handle the removal of the options and their arguments correctly, ensuring that the index is within the bounds of the script parts list.
