### Analysis
1. The function aims to modify the `command.script_parts` list by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` followed by its argument.
2. The function then extracts the relevant information from `command.stderr` to construct the new command.
3. The error occurs when trying to remove the command options from the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError`.
   
### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to trying to remove the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when the function tries to pop the same index again.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if an option is found at `upstream_option_index`, we only pop that index once, not twice.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is valid before popping
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes proper checks to avoid popping the same index twice and makes sure that the index is valid before the second pop operation.
