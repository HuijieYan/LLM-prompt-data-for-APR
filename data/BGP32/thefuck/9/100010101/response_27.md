### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to process a `git push` command and extract the argument that specifies the upstream branch. The function removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command since this information is contained in the error message. The bug occurs when attempting to remove both the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop from a position that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because after removing the flag at the specified index from the `command.script_parts` list, the subsequent removal at the same index should not be attempted since the list would have shifted after the first pop operation. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove from an index that is out of range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first identify and remove the flag from the `command.script_parts` list. Then, we should update the `upstream_option_index` if the flag was found and shifted the remaining elements in the list. This ensures that we handle the removal of the flag and its argument correctly.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        upstream_arg_index = upstream_option_index + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_arg_index)  # Remove the argument first
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Then remove the flag

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This updated function should now handle the removal of the flag and its argument correctly, avoiding the `IndexError` that occurred before. The corrected function is expected to pass all the test cases provided.
