### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the command script and its argument if present. It then retrieves the suggested push command from the stderr message and replaces the `push` part of the command with the retrieved push command.

The error message is an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an index out of the range of `command.script_parts`. This error can happen if the indexes are being accessed or manipulated incorrectly.

### Bug
The bug occurs when multiple upstream flag indexes need to be handled. The code checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags but fails to handle the scenario when both are present in the script parts. As a result, it raises an `IndexError` when attempting to pop the elements out of `command.script_parts`.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to consider handling both cases where `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags may exist in the `command.script_parts`. We need to adjust the logic to handle the situation where both flags are present.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    upstream_flags = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for flag in upstream_flags:
        try:
            upstream_index = script_parts.index(flag)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # Remove the flag
            script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # Remove the argument of the flag
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, this corrected function should handle both cases where `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags exist in the script parts list. It should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
