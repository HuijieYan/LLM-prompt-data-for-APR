### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is not handling the case when the `-u` option is passed in the `git push` command correctly. The function is trying to remove `-u` using the `index` method but ends up causing an `IndexError` due to the incorrect use of the `pop` method.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case, when the `git push -u` command is passed to the function, it successfully finds the index of `-u` in `command.script_parts` and then attempts to remove it using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. 
2. However, when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, the `pop` method is called twice consecutively at the same index, causing an `IndexError` on the second call.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check both `--set-upstream` and `-u` indices separately.
2. If either of these indices is found, remove the corresponding option.
3. Adjust the index for popping, ensuring that removal of the option does not affect the subsequent element positions.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function will now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, ensuring that the expected behavior is maintained for all cases mentioned above.
