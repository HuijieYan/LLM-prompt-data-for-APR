### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command based on the error message provided in the `stderr`. The function first tries to find the indices of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `script_parts` of the command. If found, it removes them. Then it extracts the suggested git push command from the error message in `stderr` and replaces the "push" argument in the original command with this suggested command.

The main issue causing the bug is in the removal of elements from `command.script_parts`. After removing an element at index `upstream_option_index`, the list shifts to the left, which changes the index of the other option (`-u`). When the function tries to remove at `upstream_option_index` for the second time, it references the wrong index leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the removal operation in `command.script_parts`. The function tries to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, leading to incorrect indices and the `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the element at `upstream_option_index` once if an option is found. We can use a list to store the indices of the options found and then pop them at the end in reverse order to avoid index shifts.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    options_to_remove = []
    try:
        options_to_remove.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        options_to_remove.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    except ValueError:
        pass

    for option_index in reversed(options_to_remove):
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes storing the indices of options to remove and then removing them in reverse order to prevent index shifting issues. This fix should handle the cases provided and pass the failing test.
