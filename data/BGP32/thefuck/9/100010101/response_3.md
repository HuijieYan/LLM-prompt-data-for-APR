## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git command by removing "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and its argument from the command. The bug occurs when trying to pop the elements at the `upstream_option_index` twice, which leads to an `IndexError` due to removing elements that are already out of range.

## Bug Reason
1. The function tries to remove the `upstream_option_index` twice when it only needs to remove it once.
2. If there is no occurrence of "--set-upstream" or "-u" in `command.script_parts`, then the `upstream_option_index` remains -1. We should check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before performing any pop operations.

## Fix Strategy
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before trying to remove elements from the list.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected version includes a check before popping the elements based on the `upstream_option_index`. This revision ensures that only one removal operation is performed if needed.
