### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to modify the `command.script_parts` list by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. However, there are a few issues causing the function to fail:
1. The code is using `upstream_option_index` variable as a check for the existence of the option, but it's initialized to `-1` and never updated correctly based on the index found during the search for '--set-upstream' or '-u'.
2. The pop operation is called twice on `command.script_parts` inside the condition, which might lead to an `IndexError` depending on the position of the option in the list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `upstream_option_index` value based on the index found for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options.
2. Check if the found index is not equal to `-1` before attempting to remove the option from the script_parts list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check boundary before popping
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present at different positions in the `command.script_parts` list.
