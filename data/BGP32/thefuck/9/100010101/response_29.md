### Correction Strategy
The bug in the given function arises from the fact that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are being checked separately, but only one index removal is being attempted. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the second index if both options are present. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that every found index is removed.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    while upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
