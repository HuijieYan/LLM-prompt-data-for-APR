### Explanation:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process the command output in order to correct git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command script.
- The bug occurs because in the case where `-u` is present, although the first `try` block successfully finds and removes `--set-upstream`, it also incorrectly indexes up to `-u` in the second `try` block. This causes an `IndexError` when attempting to remove elements at an index higher than the available length of the list.
- The bug is specifically due to trying to remove elements twice at the same index when handling the `-u` option, thus raising an `IndexError` due to accessing an out-of-range index.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `pop` operation happens only once for each detected option, whether `--set-upstream` or `-u`. We can achieve this by updating the logic of populating the `upstream_option_index` variable and handling the removal operation.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the removal operation within each block and handling the absence of either option correctly, we ensure that elements are removed only if found, preventing the `IndexError` during the pop operation.
