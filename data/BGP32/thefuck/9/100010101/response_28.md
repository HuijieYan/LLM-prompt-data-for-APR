### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and its argument. Then, it extracts the last line of the `stderr`, which contains the suggested git command for setting up the upstream branch.
- The bug occurs when trying to remove the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. It results in an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.
- The expected behavior is to correctly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, extract the suggested command, and replace the `push` part of the original command with the extracted value.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by attempting to pop twice at the same index when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found. This leads to an `IndexError` because the list becomes shorter before the second pop operation.

### Fix Strategy
- We can change the logic to remove the option and its argument with a single pop operation.
- If `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, we remove both the option and its argument by popping once.
- We also need to handle cases where the option is not found and set the correct `upstream_option_index` before attempting to pop.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version should now handle the removal of the option and its argument correctly, avoiding the `IndexError` and passing all the test cases.
