### Analysis
1. The function `get_new_command` aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `script_parts` list of the command. Then, it extracts the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` of the command, which is the desired command to be executed after modifications.
2. The bug occurs when trying to pop the same index twice from the `script_parts` list, which leads to an `IndexError`.
3. The bug happens because when the index of `--set-upstream` is found, the subsequent `pop` command removes an element, shifting the indexes. Then, if the index of `-u` is found which occurs at the same index as the previously removed element, popping it again at the same index causes the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if one of the options is found and removed, the search and removal of the other option should not start from the initial index, but rather the remaining command parts after removing the first option. This will prevent the index shifting issue and avoid the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    
    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument
    command_copy = script_parts.copy()
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_copy.index('--set-upstream')
        command_copy.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command_copy.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command_copy.index('-u')
            command_copy.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            command_copy.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_copy), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function fixes the bug by making sure that the script parts are copied and manipulated separately for each option removal to prevent index conflicts. This enables the function to handle both cases with correct index removal and concatenate the final command as expected.
