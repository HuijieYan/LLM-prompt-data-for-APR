The buggy function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. However, the bug occurs because the same index is accessed twice for popping when `-u` is present, leading to an `IndexError` as the list length changes after the first pop operation.

To fix this bug, we need to avoid accessing the same index twice for popping. We should only pop once for each occurrence of the flag.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only perform the second pop if the list still contains the flag
        if command.script_parts.count('--set-upstream') > 0 or command.script_parts.count('-u') > 0:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the pop operation is performed only when the flag is present in the modified `command.script_parts` list. This fix addresses the `IndexError` that occurred due to accessing the same index twice for popping the list.
