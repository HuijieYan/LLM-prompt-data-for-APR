### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to extract the command to push to an upstream branch from the stderr output of the `git push` command. The issue lies in the removal of the option `-u` or `--set-upstream` from the `script_parts` list. The buggy function is erroneously accessing the index of the option and then removing it. In the failing test case, the index goes out of range due to an incorrect pop operation, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because whenever the `--set-upstream` option is found, it is removed from the `script_parts` list, but the immediate action following this (which would remove the index containing `-u` as the option) is based on the same updated index, which results in erroneous index removal causing the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that index removal update for `-u` follows directly after removing `--set-upstream` if it exists in the `script_parts` list. This will prevent the index from going out of range.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # updated correctly here
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # adjusting for proper index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the removal of the upstream options without causing the index error seen in the failing test case.
