### Analysis
- The buggy function is intended to modify the git push command based on the stderr output from git.
- The function is trying to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list to remove them.
- The bug occurs when the script_parts list does not contain the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, leading to an IndexError when trying to pop elements from the list.
- The function then extracts a string from the stderr to get the correct push command.
- The bug triggers when the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found in the script_parts list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the way the function is searching for the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Instead of using two separate try-except blocks, use a single try-except block with both searches.
- Check if the index is found before trying to pop elements from the list.

### The Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is valid
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
