### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument before generating the corrected command. The bug arises when trying to remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice if found in the script parts, leading to an `IndexError` due to out-of-range indexing.

#### Error Cause
The error originates from removing the `upstream_option_index` element twice in the `command.script_parts` list, assuming that the index will remain the same even after the first removal. This assumption leads to the second `pop(upstream_option_index)` attempt targeting an incorrect index, causing the IndexError.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that if an `upstream_option_index` is found in the script parts list, we only remove it once. After removing it once, we should not repeat the removal action. This adjustment will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):

    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function addresses the bug by checking if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the script parts list before attempting to remove them. Additionally, it ensures that each option is only removed once, avoiding the IndexError scenario.
