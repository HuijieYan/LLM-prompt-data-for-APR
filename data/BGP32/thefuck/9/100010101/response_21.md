## Analyzing the buggy function
- The buggy function's main purpose is to extract the necessary information from the `stderr` of a `git push` command and construct a new command based on that information.
- The function checks if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the command. If found, it removes them and their corresponding arguments.
- The function then extracts part of the `stderr` message to construct the new command.

## Identifying potential error locations
1. The use of `upstream_option_index` to determine the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` might lead to incorrect removal of these options.
2. Accessing the `stderr` message and splitting it might not always yield the expected output, especially if the format changes.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` based on the index obtained from `upstream_option_index`. The pop operations can cause an index out of range error if called multiple times for the same index.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of elements more carefully. Additionally, we should ensure that the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` message is done in a robust manner.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        return None
```

This corrected version handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly and guards against errors while extracting `push_upstream` from the `stderr` message.
