### Analysis
The buggy function aims to modify a git push command based on the error message provided in the stderr. It extracts the necessary information from the stderr message and updates the command accordingly. The main issue causing the error is the incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect index handling while attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list. When removing the options like '--set-upstream' or '-u', the code pops elements from the list but doesn't consider updating the index position accordingly. As a result, it tries to pop an element using the outdated index, leading to an IndexError.

### Fix
To fix this bug, the code needs to update the branch index correctly whenever an element is popped from the list. This adjustment ensures that the index remains valid after each removal. Also, we need to check if the `-u` option is present in the command to ensure proper handling.

### Updated Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument associated with the option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this updated code, the function should handle the removal of options and arguments correctly, ensuring that the index is updated accordingly. This revised version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for different scenarios.
