## Bug Analysis
The buggy function has an issue with populating the `upstream_option_index` variable correctly. It always assigns the value of `-1` initially and then proceeds with two try-except blocks to update this value based on the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script parts. However, since the second try block unconditionally runs, it overrides the value set by the first try block, leading to incorrect handling of the presence of `-u`. Also, once the index is found, the function pops twice from the script parts list regardless of the fact that the same index is popping twice, which results in an IndexError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the second try block to execute only if `-u` is not found in the script parts.
2. Correctly handle popping from the `command.script_parts` list by removing the second pop action as it's unnecessary.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Update this line
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Update this line
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        #pop only once as the same index is referring to both --set-upstream and -u
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By incorporating the suggested changes, the corrected function should now properly handle `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the command script parts without causing IndexError and return the expected new command string.
