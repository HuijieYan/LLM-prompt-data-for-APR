### Analysis
- The buggy function aims to parse the output of a Git push command to extract the push command with upstream information.
- The function searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the command arguments and removes them.
- The function then extracts the push command with upstream details from the stderr of the command.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when the function tries to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts` list. If the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found, the function tries to pop elements at the index of `upstream_option_index`. However, the function incorrectly pops twice, which causes an `IndexError` when the index goes out of range on the second pop operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- When removing elements from the list, we should only pop once, as each pop operation shifts the index of elements in the list.
- Correctly determine the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag, and then remove only that element from the list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function iterates over the `upstream_options` list to check and remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags if they are present in the command. This modification ensures that only one element is removed from the list when the flag is found.
