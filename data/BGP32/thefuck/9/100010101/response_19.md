### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to the erroneous logic in the function where it attempts to pop elements from `command.script_parts` without ensuring that the index is valid. This results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before popping elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to correctly identify the push command that needs to be replaced in the new command.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # Extract the push command and create the new command
    push_command_index = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].find('git')
    push_command = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3][push_command_index:]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_command)
```

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary check to ensure valid index before popping elements and correctly extracts the push command from the command error message.
