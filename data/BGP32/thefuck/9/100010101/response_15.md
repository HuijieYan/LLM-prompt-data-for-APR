### Analysis
- The buggy function is designed to handle Git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command for further processing.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an element from a list.
- The buggy function fails to properly handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command.
- The expected output involves removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then constructing a new `git push` command using information from the error message.

### Bug
- The bug lies in the lines where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is trying to remove the detected option and its argument. When the option is not found, the `upstream_option_index` remains at its initial value of -1, causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element at the index -1.

### Fix Strategy
- Check if `upstream_option_index` is greater than or equal to 0 before trying to remove elements to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:  # Check if option is found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected version includes a check to only remove elements if the `upstream_option_index` is greater than or equal to 0, preventing the `IndexError`.
