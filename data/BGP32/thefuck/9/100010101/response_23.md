### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the `-u` option is present in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop the last element.
2. The loop to check for the presence of `-u` overwrites the value of `upstream_option_index` instead of using a condition to append it.
3. The `push_upstream` variable extraction relies on the assumption that the required string is always in the same position in the stderr, which may not always hold true.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the loop to correctly determine the presence of `-u` without overwriting the `upstream_option_index`.
2. Handle the extraction of `push_upstream` string more reliably by looking for user-specific git commands.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = ''
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split('git ')[-1].strip()
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the presence of the `-u` option, ensures the extraction of `push_upstream` is more robust by searching for git push commands in stderr, and should pass all the input/output test cases provided.
