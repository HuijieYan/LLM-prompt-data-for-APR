### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands and modify them based on the output received. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` an element from `command.script_parts`. This error occurs when the `upstream_option_index` variable is set incorrectly.

The function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and its argument and then extract the suggested push command from the error message to build a new command. However, the error occurs because after finding the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, it incorrectly tries to remove it twice. This leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range in the list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic related to removing the option and its argument. After finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, we should only remove it once. We also need to handle cases where the index is not found. Additionally, we should verify the output format of `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` to ensure that the extraction of the correct push command is performed properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    vote_list = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for opt in vote_list:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only remove once, not twice
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version ensures that the removal of the option and its argument happens only once if found. This version should now handle different cases correctly and pass the failing test scenario provided.
