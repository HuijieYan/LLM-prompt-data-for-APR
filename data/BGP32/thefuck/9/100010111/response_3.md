### Analysis:
1. The buggy function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the `script_parts` list of the `Command` object.
2. The function then extracts the last relevant line from the `stderr`, which contains the correct push command.
3. The function would then replace the `push` command in the original `script_parts` list with the correct push command.
4. The error occurs when trying to remove an element from the `script_parts` list using `pop()` function since it may attempt to remove the same element twice.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `upstream_option_index` variable is being assigned the same value for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. This leads to the incorrect removal of the same index from `script_parts` list twice, causing an `IndexError` when trying to `pop()` the same index twice.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and remove the corresponding index only once. Additionally, we need to ensure that the index exists before attempting to remove it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version first checks if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options exist in the `script_parts` list. Then, it removes the index corresponding to the found option only once. This fixes the bug and ensures the correct push command is generated based on the stderr information.
