## Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands, specifically focusing on removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments before suggesting a new command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to access an element beyond the range of the list `command.script_parts`.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The `pop` operation on `command.script_parts` is causing the IndexError when attempting to remove elements based on the `upstream_option_index`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function is trying to pop elements based on an index that may not exist in the list. When the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present, the index value remains unchanged (-1), leading to the attempt of popping an element at index -1.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is a valid index within the range of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to pop elements based on it.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    # Remove the option and its argument from script_parts if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract the new push command without the option and its argument
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes a loop to search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, handles the removal of the option and its argument based on a valid index, and ensures that the pop operation is within the bounds of the list.
