## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `get_new_command`. It is designed to modify the `command` argument by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and its argument, if present. It then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr and uses `replace_argument` to generate the corrected command.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` while trying to use `pop()` on `command.script_parts`. This error occurs when trying to pop an item from an empty list or an index out of range.
3. The cause of the bug is that after removing `-u` or `--set-upstream` from `command.script_parts`, the pop operation is attempted again for the same index, leading to an `IndexError`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the pop operation is only executed once for the correct index.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

## Correction
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function properly handles removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument only once. This should resolve the `IndexError` causing the failing test case.
