## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to handle suggestions for correcting the `git push` command. The function first checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command, then removes them. It then extracts the necessary information from the stderr to construct the corrected command.

From the error message and test cases, we can see that the function fails when trying to pop an item from `command.script_parts` with an index that is out of range. This error occurs when handling the `-u` option in the command.

## Bug Cause

- The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `-u` option in the command.
- The buggy function expects the index of `-u` and then removes it twice when found, which leads to an `IndexError` when `-u` is the last item in the `command.script_parts`.
- The function `script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` should only be called once after finding the index of `-u`.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the function handles the `-u` option in the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    remove_set_upstream = False
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        remove_set_upstream = True
    elif '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        remove_set_upstream = True

    if remove_set_upstream:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using a boolean flag `remove_set_upstream`, we ensure that we only pop the `'-u'` or `'--set-upstream'` once if found, preventing the `IndexError`.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and handle the `-u` option correctly.
