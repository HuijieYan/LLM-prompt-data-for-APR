### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is passed in a `git push` command. It is supposed to remove these flags and their arguments from the list of command parts and then extract the suggested push command from the error message.

The bug causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts` based on the `upstream_option_index`, which represents the index of the found flag (`--set-upstream` or `-u`). This error occurs because both `--set-upstream` and `-u` index removal is attempted unconditionally, even if only one of them is found. In case of finding the `-u` flag, an index error occurs because the element has already been removed with the `--set-upstream` logic.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should ensure that if one of the flags is found (`--set-upstream` or `-u`), we remove it and its argument only once. Additionally, if multiple flags are present, we should remove the appropriate elements based on the index found for the flag to avoid errors related to index out of range.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index_set_upstream = None
    try:
        upstream_option_index_set_upstream = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    upstream_option_index_u = None
    try:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index_set_upstream is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_set_upstream)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_set_upstream)
    elif upstream_option_index_u is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function appropriately handles the scenario when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the `git push` command. It ensures that the index out of range error is avoided by popping the elements based on the correct indexes.
