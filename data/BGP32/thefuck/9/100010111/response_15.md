### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to process git push commands and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, then suggest a new git push command.
2. The error occurs due to the presence of two pop operations that remove the upstream_option_index element, which would lead to an IndexError if the element does not exist.
3. The error message indicates an IndexError when trying to pop an item from the command.script_parts list. This issue arises because the upstream_option_index is incorrectly used to remove elements without checking their validity, resulting in an out-of-range index error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the upstream_option_index is checked before removing elements. If the index is valid, then pop the elements from the list in a safe manner.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks to ensure the index is valid for both removal operations, avoiding the IndexError.
