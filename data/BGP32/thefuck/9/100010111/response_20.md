The bug in the function `get_new_command` is related to the handling of the `-u` argument. The function incorrectly removes both the option `-u` and its argument, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element that does not exist in the list. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the `-u` option and its argument.

I will modify the function to correctly handle the `-u` option and its argument, ensuring that only the option is removed without its corresponding argument. Additionally, the function will extract the correct push command suggestion from the stderr message that includes the upstream branch information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support


@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it but keep the argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
       script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function addresses the bug by correctly handling the removal of the `-u` argument and extracting the push command suggestion from the stderr message. The function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values based on the given input scenarios.
