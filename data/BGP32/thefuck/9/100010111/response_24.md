### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list if found. Then, it tries to extract the suggested git command from the `command.stderr`, specifically the line `-3` from the end.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts` list using the same index twice. The error message indicates an `IndexError` for trying to pop an index that is out of range.
3. The bug is caused by the improper handling of the index `upstream_option_index`. In cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present, a wrong index is used to pop elements from the list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present correctly. We should remove each option individually from the list to avoid index out of range errors.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to pop only once for each occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Ensure that popping is done correctly for each matching index.
3. Adjust the condition for removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` to handle both cases independently.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments separately.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '--set-upstream':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        elif command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function should handle both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` correctly and no longer throw an `IndexError`.
