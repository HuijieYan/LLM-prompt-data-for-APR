### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to modify the command for `git push` based on the stderr output. It looks for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and removes it along with its argument.
- The bug occurs when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` at an incorrect index, resulting in an `IndexError`.
- The expected output should be `"git push --set-upstream origin master"` for all cases when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the command.
- The provided cases cover scenarios with different combinations of command arguments.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug arises due to incorrect pop index calculation when `-u` is present in the command.
- When `-u` is found, it sets `upstream_option_index` to its index. However, instead of immediately removing both the option and its argument, it attempts to remove the same index twice.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the logic for removing the option and its argument to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases correctly.
- Ensure that when either option is found, both the option and its argument are removed from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version ensures that both the option and its argument are removed correctly. This update should resolve the pop index out of range issue.
