## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle situations where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. However, the implementation has a bug in removing these options and their arguments. The bug arises when attempting to remove the `-u` option because it pops twice, leading to an `IndexError` due to going out of bounds.

## Bug Explanation
- The buggy function is designed to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts`.
- If either option is found, they are removed along with their argument, assuming it is present next in the list.
- The bug occurs specifically when `-u` option is found. After successfully removing the `-u` option once, the function continues to attempt to remove it again, causing an index out of range error because the list has changed.
- This bug prevents the function from correctly constructing the new command by removing the necessary arguments and options.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Ensure that after successfully removing the `-u` option, the function checks whether the index is still valid before attempting another removal.
- Remove unnecessary double pop operation on the same index to avoid the out of range error.
- Handle the case where the argument for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in an appropriate manner.
- Ensure the correct construction of the new command without any extraneous options.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there still elements to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the removal logic and adding a check to ensure that the index doesn't go out of bounds, we address the bug present in the original function. This corrected version should now handle the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments without causing any index out of range errors.
