### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the git push command and modify the command accordingly. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop a script part based on the index without checking if it's within the valid range. The function is failing to correctly process the command and extract the necessary information for the new command construction.

### Bug
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of the index `upstream_option_index` when it is found. The code mistakenly attempts to pop twice from the same index, which causes the `IndexError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before attempting to pop elements.
2. Adjust the extraction of the `push_upstream` string from the `stderr` message to include the correct slicing for the final command suggested by `git`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Justification
1. We now check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before popping script parts, preventing the `IndexError`.
2. Adjust the slicing of the `push_upstream` string to correctly extract the final command suggested by `git` from the stderr message.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the git push command and provide the expected outcome for the test cases.
