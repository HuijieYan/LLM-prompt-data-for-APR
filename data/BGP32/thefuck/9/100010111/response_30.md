### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to handle the case when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is passed and modify the command accordingly. It then extracts the new command suggestion from the stderr and replaces the relevant part of the command.
- The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range" occurring in the function.
- The function seems to be trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the `upstream_option_index`, leading to the error.
- The correction needed is to ensure that the elements are popped only if they exist in the list.

### Fix Strategy
- Check if `upstream_option_index` is within the bounds of the list before popping elements.
- Change the logic to correctly handle the case where `-u` is in the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index+1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function first checks if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 and also if the next index is within the bounds before popping the elements. This ensures that no IndexError occurs.
