### Analysis:
- The buggy function is supposed to modify the input git command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options along with their arguments. It then extracts the git push suggestion from the stderr output.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the function, specifically when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`.
- The function is not correctly handling the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the command.
- The function should handle cases where the option appears multiple times.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function always tries to pop an element from the index found, regardless of whether it exists or not.
- In some cases, the index value `upstream_option_index` remains `-1`, indicating the option was not found. If this index is used for popping elements, it results in an `IndexError`.

### Proposed Fix:
- Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before trying to pop elements.
- Adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where the option is not found.
- Consider handling cases where the option appears multiple times.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before attempting to pop elements. It ensures that popping only occurs if the option is actually found in the command.
