## Analyzing the buggy function

- **Error Message**: The error message indicates an `IndexError` when calling `pop` on a list with an index that is out of range.
- **Expected Input/Output Values**: The function should parse the command script and stderr to construct a new git push command without `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue (#538) describes the incorrect suggestions for `git push -u myfork` after a certain change (#538) was merged.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. Incorrect handling of `upstream_option_index` when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are not found.
2. Incorrect removal of elements in the command script parts list without checking if they are available or not.
3. Parsing of `push_upstream` from the stderr could be problematic.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of the index for the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. When these are not found, the function proceeds to manipulate the script parts list assuming they exist, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements. Additionally, parsing `push_upstream` from the stderr could also be faulty.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. Ensure robust handling of the index finding process for `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Check if the elements to be removed exist in the list before performing operations like popping.
3. Verify the extraction of `push_upstream` from stderr to avoid potential errors.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the handling of `--set-upstream` and `-u` indexes is proper, checks the existence of elements before manipulating the list, and correctly extracts the `push_upstream` value from stderr.
