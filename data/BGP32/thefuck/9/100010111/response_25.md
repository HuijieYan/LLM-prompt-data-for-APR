### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands and modify them accordingly. The function looks for the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option in the command and removes it along with its argument if found. The function then extracts the corrected push command from the stderr message.

The error occurs when trying to pop the same index twice in case the "-u" option is found. This leads to an IndexError, indicating that the index is out of range.

The expected behavior of the function is to correctly identify and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option from the command script parts and then generate the new fixed push command based on the stderr message.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the selected index once to prevent the IndexError. Additionally, we need to verify the logic for handling both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the selected index is only popped once and handles both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options correctly. The function should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue.
