### Analysis:
- The buggy function is aimed at generating a corrected git push command by removing unnecessary flags like --set-upstream and -u that are already included in the stderr message returned by the original git push command.
- The function is currently encountering an IndexError when trying to remove elements from the command.script_parts list. This error occurs because it tries to pop the same index twice, which can lead to going out of range.
- The expected output is to remove the unnecessary --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument from the command and then construct a new git push command using the push_upstream string extracted from the stderr message.
- The failing test is because when there is a flag -u in the command.script_parts list, it erroneously tries to pop the same index twice.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to popping the same index twice from command.script_parts when dealing with the -u option. When -u is found, the code erroneously pops the same index again, leading to an IndexError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct how the script removes the -u or --set-upstream options. We can keep track of whether any of these options were found in the command and only pop the respective index once if detected.

### The corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug by properly handling the removal of the -u or --set-upstream option and its argument. It should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
