## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle a git push command by adjusting the arguments based on the presence of certain flags like --set-upstream or -u.
2. The error message is `IndexError: pop index out of range` which indicates that the index used in the `pop` function to remove elements from `command.script_parts` is out of range.
3. The function fails to consider the scenario where the `-u` flag is present in the command, resulting in the attempt to remove element twice (which leads to the IndexError).
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command, consequently adjusting the index removal logic. 

## Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Check if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command.
2. If either is found, remove the flag and its argument from the script_parts list.
3. Extract the target push upstream value correctly.
4. Replace the unnecessary flags with the correct push upstream value.

## The corrected function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their argument if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By considering both flags separately and adjusting the removal logic accordingly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
