### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify the command to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present. The bug occurs because after removing the flag, the function attempts to remove it again.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by attempting to remove the flag at index `upstream_option_index` twice, even when it's already been removed once.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove the argument from `command.script_parts`.
2. If -1 is not returned, remove the argument once and update the value of `upstream_option_index` to -1 so that if the flag occurs multiple times, only the first occurrence is removed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        upstream_option_index = -1

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function now properly handles the case where the flag has been removed once. The function only removes the flag at the first occurrence and updates the index to prevent multiple removal attempts.
