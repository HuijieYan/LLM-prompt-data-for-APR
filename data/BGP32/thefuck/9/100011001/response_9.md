### Issue Analysis
The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range` at `thefuck/rules/git_push.py:27`. This error occurs because the function is trying to remove elements from a list using the `pop` method with an index that is out of range. 

Looking at the buggy function:
1. The function checks for the index of `--set-upstream`, and if not found, it checks for the index of `-u`.
2. When either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, the function attempts to remove the element at the found index twice, which may lead to an out of range index error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when an option (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) is found, it is only removed once from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to handle cases where an option is not found, to prevent the index error.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break  # Exit loop if option is found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Verification
After implementing the fix, the function should now handle the removal of the option correctly without causing an index error. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
