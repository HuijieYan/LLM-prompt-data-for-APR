The bug in the function is caused by the IndexError when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. The error occurs because when the `-u` flag is found, two elements are popped from the list consecutively, which might cause the index to go out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only one element is popped when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This version addresses the bug by only popping one element from `command.script_parts` if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found. This ensures that the index doesn't go out of range.
