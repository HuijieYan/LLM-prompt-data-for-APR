### Potential Error Locations
1. The variable `upstream_option_index` is initialized to -1, but it is not being properly updated if '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags are found in the `command.script_parts`.
2. The code block that removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and their arguments from `command.script_parts` seems to have an issue as it is attempting to pop the same index twice, leading to an IndexError.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the script incorrectly attempts to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts` when removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument. If either '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag is found in the `script_parts`, the first `pop` operation removes that flag, and then the second `pop` operation tries to remove the argument associated with that flag, causing the IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should:
- Update the condition for checking if '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags are present in `command.script_parts` properly.
- Ensure that if either flag is found, only one element is removed from `command.script_parts`, not both.
- Handle the case where the flag argument may be located in the next index after the flag itself.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and their arguments, ensuring that it does not attempt to pop an out-of-range index, thus passing the failing test.
