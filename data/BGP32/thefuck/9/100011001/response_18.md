### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `-u` flag is found in the `command.script_parts`, the index of that flag is stored in the variable `upstream_option_index`. However, when removing both the flag and its argument using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, the index becomes out of range for the second pop operation, which leads to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove each element once, and adjust the index accordingly. One way to do this is by storing the index of the flag and its argument in separate variables and then removing each one individually.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
        # Adjust the index since the previous pop operation shifts elements
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now handle the removal of the `-u` flag and its argument without causing an `IndexError`.
