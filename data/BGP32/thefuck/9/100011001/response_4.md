### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to remove an argument from the command script_parts based on the presence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`. It then tries to extract the push command suggested by `git` from the stderr and replace the argument with it. However, there are a couple of issues causing the function to fail:
1. The function is attempting to pop twice from the script_parts list instead of just once, leading to an `IndexError`.
2. The `push_upstream` extraction is incorrect, as it is assuming the push command is the third last line in the stderr, which may not always be the case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the pop operation by only popping once from the script_parts list.
2. Update the extraction of the push command from the stderr by finding the correct line.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if opt in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(opt)

    # Extract the push command suggested by git from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = None
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream_start = line.find('git push --set-upstream')
            push_upstream = line[push_upstream_start:]
            break

    if push_upstream is not None:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream.strip())
    else:
        return None
``` 

The corrected function makes sure to only remove the upstream argument once and properly extracts the push command suggestion from the stderr message.
