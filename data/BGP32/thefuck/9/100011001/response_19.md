### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs when trying to remove the '-u' flag from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug is caused by the fact that after removing the '--set-upstream' flag, the index of '-u' in the list is no longer accurate, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove it.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the element at the correct index in the `command.script_parts` list. We can achieve this by only removing the element at `upstream_option_index` if it is not equal to -1, which means the flag was found in the command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only remove the element at index if it was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

### Testing the Corrected Version
The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
