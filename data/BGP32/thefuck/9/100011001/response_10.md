The bug in the function is caused by the fact that the `upstream_option_index` is being set to -1 initially and then being updated without checking if it has already been updated once. This leads to both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options being removed from `command.script_parts`, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to remove `-u` again.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is still -1 before updating it in the second `try` block. Additionally, we should only remove the option once from `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the removal of the `-u` option correctly and output the expected command.
