### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the `command.script_parts` list. If the option is found, it is attempted to remove it twice, which leads to an `IndexError` when the second `pop` operation is executed. This error occurs because after the first `pop` operation, the list size decreases, and the index of the second `pop` operation becomes out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index removal is done only once if the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is found in the list of script parts.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

### Updated Explanation
I have modified the code to remove the second `pop` operation from the script parts list if either `-u` or `--set-upstream` is found. This change ensures that the removal operation is only done once and avoids the `IndexError` that was occurring before. Now the corrected function should handle the input correctly and pass the failing test.
