### **Analysis:**

The buggy function is designed to extract the command to push changes upstream in a Git repository. The function looks for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the input command, removes it, and then extracts the suggested push command after examining the stderr output from Git.

However, the bug in the function is caused by mistakenly attempting to remove the same index from `command.script_parts` twice when the `-u` flag is found, which leads to an `IndexError` because the index is removed the first time it is encountered.

The failing test is specifically failing when the `-u` flag is present in the command because of this mistake.

### **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, the code should correctly remove the found index once and not attempt to remove it again. This can be achieved by updating the logic inside the `if` block to only remove the index once. We should also update the logic for finding the index of `-u` to correctly search for both options and take the appropriate action when found.

### **Corrected Version:**

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### **Explanation:**

The corrected version of the function ensures that the index is removed only once when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the list of script parts. It correctly handles both options and updates the index only once, preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy version.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and successfully extract the push command from the stderr output.
