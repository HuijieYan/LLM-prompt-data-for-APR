### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command input and then extract the push command with the upstream branch information from the stderr message.

The bug occurs because when the code tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, it removes it twice from the `command.script_parts`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` from an index that is out of range.

In the failing test case, the `command.script_parts` initially contains `['git', 'push']`, and the `upstream_option_index` is set to `-1`. After trying to find the index of `-u`, it retains the value `-1`. When the code executes `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, it tries to remove an element at index `-1`, hence causing the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument once from the `command.script_parts` list. This can be achieved by simply checking if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before trying to `pop` the elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if index is found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version checks if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before attempting to remove elements from the list, addressing the `IndexError` issue identified in the bug.
