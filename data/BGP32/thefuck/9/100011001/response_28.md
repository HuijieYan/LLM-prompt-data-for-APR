### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect removal of elements from `command.script_parts` list. When `-u` flag is present in the command, it is trying to pop the same index (upstream_option_index) twice, which results in an `IndexError` because the list is modified after the first pop operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their corresponding argument from the `command.script_parts` list in a single operation rather than trying to pop one index twice.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the flag
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument associated with the flag
            break  # Exit loop if flag is found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By fixing the removal of flags and arguments together, the function now correctly handles scenarios with both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
