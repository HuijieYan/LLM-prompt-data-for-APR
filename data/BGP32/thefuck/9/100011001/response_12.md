### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command and its argument and then construct a new command by replacing the `push` argument with the appropriate upstream branch.
- The bug is caused by the removal of the `upstream_option_index` twice from `command.script_parts`.
- When the `-u` option is present in the command, it sets `upstream_option_index` to the index of `-u`. If both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, it will only consider the index of the `-u` option.
- Trying to remove the `-u` index again from `command.script_parts` results in an `IndexError` because it has already been modified in the case of multiple flags.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the `upstream_option_index` once from `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by using a conditional check before removing the index. If the `-u` option is found, we should remove its index and then break from the loop.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break  # exit the loop when a flag is found
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected version of the function includes a loop to check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags. It removes the index of the first flag found and breaks out of the loop to prevent multiple deletions.
