The bug in the function is caused by the double pop operation on the `command.script_parts` list when the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found. The double pop statement `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is trying to remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice, causing an `IndexError` when the list becomes empty after the first pop operation.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the second pop operation on `command.script_parts` and ensure we only pop the element once.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and properly handle the pop operation without causing an `IndexError`.
