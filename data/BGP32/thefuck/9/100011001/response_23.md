### Analysis
- The buggy function is trying to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list to remove them. However, it is not correctly handling the scenario where one of these options might not be present in the `command.script_parts` list.
- The `IndexError` is occurring when trying to `pop` from the `command.script_parts` list with an index that is out of range, which happens when one of the options is not found in the list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options will always be present in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` an index that is out of range.

### Fix Strategy
1. Handle the scenario where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found in the `command.script_parts` list to prevent the `IndexError`.
2. Ensure that the `push_upstream` variable extraction from `command.stderr` is correct and handles edge cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command
    # suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
