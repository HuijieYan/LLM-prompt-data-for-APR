The bug in the provided function is due to an incorrect index being used to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The code attempts to pop twice from the same index, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop an empty list.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of popping the elements in the `if` block:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indexes):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the code iterates over all possible indexes of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them in reverse order to avoid the `IndexError`.

With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test case provided.
