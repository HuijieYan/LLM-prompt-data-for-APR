### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect manipulation of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The issue occurs when the `-u` option is present in the command. The function tries to remove the `-u` flag twice from `command.script_parts`, leading to an `IndexError` because the list is modified before the second pop operation. This causes the index to be out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of the `-u` flag properly. Instead of popping the same index twice, we should only pop it once. We also need to make sure that if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, we only remove them once each.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # If both --set-upstream and -u are present, remove the other one
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adjusting the removal of the `-u` flag and ensuring it is handled correctly in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
