### Bug Analysis
- The function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list, but it is incorrectly popping the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.
- The `push_upstream` variable is incorrectly extracting the push command from the `command.stderr`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. Additionally, the extraction of the push command from `command.stderr` should be corrected.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and extract the push command from the `command.stderr` as intended.
