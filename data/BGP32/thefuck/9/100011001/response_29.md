### Analyzing the buggy function

The function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from it and replacing the push argument with the actual remote and branch information. However, the function has a bug that causes an `IndexError` while trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Bug identification

The bug occurs when attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the index `upstream_option_index`. The error message indicates that the index is out of range when trying to pop a value from the list. This issue arises when the `-u` option is found in the command, leading to the error.

The function mistakenly attempts to remove the `-u` option twice instead of removing the option itself and its corresponding argument.

### Bug explanation

The buggy code attempts to remove the `-u` option twice from the `command.script_parts` list. However, when the `-u` option is found in the list, it is popped twice, causing the index to go out of range on the second attempt.

### Fix strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the removal of the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This can be achieved by ensuring that the index is stored only once and then using it to remove the option and its argument sequentially.

### Corrected code

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the argument of the option as well
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By removing the argument of the `-u` option after removing the option itself, the corrected function should now work as expected.
