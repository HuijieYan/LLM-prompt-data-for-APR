### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when the function tries to pop an element from `command.script_parts` with an index that is out of range.
- The function searches for the index of `'-u'` in `command.script_parts`, however, it only removes the element once. This causes an issue when trying to remove it again.
- The error message states `IndexError: pop index out of range`, indicating that the index being used for popping is outside the range of the list.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the `'-u'` option is found in `command.script_parts`, it is removed only once. Additionally, we should check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before removing an element from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove again for '-u' case
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the `'-u'` option correctly and avoid the `IndexError`.
