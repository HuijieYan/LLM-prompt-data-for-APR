The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command script parts, as these are already included in the output of the `stderr` property. 

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, the identified issue lies in how the script parts are handled when removing the upstream option. The function incorrectly removes the option twice instead of removing the option itself and its corresponding argument. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable is derived from the wrong source, as it is expected to extract the upstream suggestion from the `stderr` output.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately remove the upstream option and its argument when present in the script parts. The `push_upstream` variable should then be extracted from the correct source to provide the intended output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed and have an argument, remove them
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the removal of the upstream option and its argument correctly, resulting in the expected output values for all provided test cases.
