The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the incorrect removal of the `-u` option and its argument. The issue arises when the function tries to find the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream` in the `command.script_parts` list and then removes them without considering their associated argument. This leads to incorrect output values when constructing the `push_upstream` string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of handling the removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options to include the removal of their respective arguments as well. Additionally, we should update the calculation of the `push_upstream` string based on the corrected `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `get_new_command`:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    found_option = False
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if found_option:
            found_option = False
            continue
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            found_option = True
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(i)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by correctly handling the removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options along with their associated arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. It ensures that the `push_upstream` string is constructed accurately based on the updated `command.script_parts`.

By applying this fix, the function should now produce the expected output values for all test cases, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
