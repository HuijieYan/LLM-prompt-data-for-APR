The buggy function is failing to correctly identify and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command, leading to incorrect suggestions for the new command. The root cause of the bug lies in the logic of the function when handling the removal of these options.

The buggy function tries to find the index of "--set-upstream" and "-u" options in the command, but it doesn't handle the case where both options might be present. Additionally, after identifying the index of the option, it incorrectly removes the option and its argument.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options separately to make sure we remove both if they exist.
2. Adjust the removal logic to also remove the argument that follows the option.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove "--set-upstream" option and its argument
    while '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    
    # Remove "-u" option and its argument
    while '-u' in command.script_parts:
        u_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(u_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > u_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(u_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will properly handle cases where both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options are present, ensuring they are removed along with their arguments. It will address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected suggestions for the new command.
