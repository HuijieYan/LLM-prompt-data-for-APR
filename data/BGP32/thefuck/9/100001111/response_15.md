The buggy function has a logical error in handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the input command. The issue arises when trying to remove the option and its argument from the script_parts list, leading to incorrect indexing and possibly removing the wrong elements.

The correct strategy to fix the bug is to update the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the script_parts list. We should first check if either option is present in the list and then remove the option along with its argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if option_index != -1:
                # Remove the option
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
                # Remove the argument of the option if it exists
                if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                    command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
                    break  # Exit the loop after successfully removing option and argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function includes a loop to iterate over both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, attempting to remove them along with their arguments correctly. This approach ensures that the function handles all cases where these options might be present in the input command.

The updated logic in this corrected version resolves the issue reported in GitHub and should now handle the input and output values as expected for various test cases.
