### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle the `git push` command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present. It then extracts the incorrect command suggested by Git from the stderr and replaces the `push` command with the extracted value.

The bug seems to occur because the function incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag. The current implementation is not correctly removing the argument associated with the flag.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly remove the flag and its associated argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the code should ensure the index where the flag is found is correctly updated after the removal operation.

### Updated Function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Correct the removal operation
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Correct the removal operation

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The updated function now correctly removes both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags along with their associated arguments from the `command.script_parts`.
- The fix ensures that the index for the flag is correctly updated after the removal operation.
- The remaining functionality of extracting the incorrect command suggested by Git and replacing the `push` command with the corrected value remains intact.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now handle the `git push` command as expected, resolving the bug and addressing the reported issue.
