The bug in the provided `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command's `script_parts`. In the buggy version, if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `script_parts`, it removes it along with the subsequent element in the list, assuming that the next element is the argument for the flag. However, this assumption leads to incorrect behavior when there are multiple arguments after the flag.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the flag and its argument from the `script_parts` list. We should locate the index of the flag and remove it along with the next element (the argument) if it exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    flag_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for flag_index in flag_indexes:
        if flag_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will properly handle cases where there are multiple arguments after the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag, ensuring that only the flag and its immediate argument are removed from the list of command parts.
