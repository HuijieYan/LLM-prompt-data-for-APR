The buggy function has a logical error in removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command. The bug causes incorrect handling of these options and leads to an incorrect final command being generated.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to only remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option if found in the command without removing its argument. After removing the option, the function should construct the final command by joining the remaining script parts and replacing the 'push' argument with the correct 'push_upstream' value obtained from the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# Corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it but keep its argument
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            opt_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            command.script_parts.pop(opt_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly and construct the final command as expected based on the input parameters and output values specified in the test cases.
