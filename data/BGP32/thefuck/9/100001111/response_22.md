The bug in the function `get_new_command` is that it is not correctly handling the case when the `-u` option is present in the command. The function is checking for the `--set-upstream` option, and if not found, checking for the `-u` option separately. However, it should consider both cases together.

The function should be modified to check for both options together and remove them if found. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value should be adjusted to capture the correct value after removing the options.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where the `-u` option is present in the command and remove it along with its argument. The `push_upstream` value extraction should also be accurate after handling the options correctly.
