### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding value from the command passed as input. However, it has a couple of issues:
1. It incorrectly pops two elements at the same index if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, leading to potential index out of range issues.
2. It extracts the pushed upstream information incorrectly from the `stderr` field of the command.

### Bug Causes:
The bug occurs because:
1. The function incorrectly attempts to remove the argument and its value by popping twice at the same index, which can lead to index out of range errors or remove incorrect elements.
2. The extraction of the push upstream information from `stderr` is incorrect, resulting in the wrong output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value by properly utilizing the index found.
2. Adjust how the push upstream information is retrieved from the `stderr` message to ensure accurate extraction.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            value_index = option_index if command.script_parts[option_index + 1] != 'origin' else option_index + 1
            command.script_parts.pop(value_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].split()[-2] + ' ' + command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function fixes the issues by correctly adjusting the indices for popping elements and appropriately extracting the push upstream information from the `stderr` message.
