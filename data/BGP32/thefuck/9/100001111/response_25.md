### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Then, it extracts the push command from the `command.stderr` and replaces the original 'push' command with the extracted one. However, the buggy function has a logical error in how it handles the removal of the options and their arguments.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` should be `if upstream_option_index != -1:` to properly check if the index was found.
2. The lines `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` should only pop the options and their arguments once each.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function pops the same index twice, which leads to incorrect command modification and the extraction of the push command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition from `is not -1` to `!= -1` for proper comparison.
2. Remove one instance of popping the option and its argument.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected version should now properly remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument before replacing the push command with the extracted one.
