### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to parse the output of a failed `git push` command and extract the correct push command to set up the upstream branch. The function searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the input command's script parts and then extracts the correct push command from the error message. However, there is a bug in the logic that populates `upstream_option_index` and removes the incorrect arguments. The bug causes incorrect indexing and removal of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code handles the removal of arguments related to `--set-upstream` or `-u` incorrectly. When trying to find the index of `-u`, it does not consider the case when `--set-upstream` is already found. Additionally, after finding the index of the option, the code incorrectly removes the option and its argument. This leads to an incorrect final command generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Properly handle the case when `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found.
- Correctly determine the number of elements to pop when removing the found option and its argument.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the cases properly and generate the correct push command without any unexpected argument removal.
