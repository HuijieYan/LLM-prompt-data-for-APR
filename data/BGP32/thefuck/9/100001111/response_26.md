The bug in the provided function is that when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value, the function is erroneously popping two elements from `command.script_parts` regardless of whether the option is found. This leads to an IndexError when the expected values are not present on the list.

To fix this bug, we should adjust the logic of popping elements from `command.script_parts` only if the upstream option is found. Additionally, we need to consider the scenario where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option may have an argument following it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option may have an argument following it and only pops elements from `command.script_parts` if the upstream option is found. This should fix the bug identified in the provided cases and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issues described.
