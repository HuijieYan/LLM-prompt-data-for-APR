The bug in the provided function lies in the way it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command script parts. The current implementation doesn't correctly handle the removal of these arguments, leading to incorrect output in certain scenarios.

The fix strategy would be to correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command script parts. To do this, we can iterate over the command script parts, check for the presence of these arguments, and remove them along with their corresponding values when found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Iterate over the command script parts to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its value
    new_command_parts = []
    skip_next = False
    for part in command.script_parts:
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            skip_next = True
            continue
        new_command_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its value from the command script parts, providing the expected output for all given test cases.
