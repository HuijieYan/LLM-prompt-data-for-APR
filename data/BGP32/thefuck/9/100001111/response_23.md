The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is that it only removes one of the options `--set-upstream` or `-u` instead of both when they are present in the input command. This leads to incorrect output when constructing the new command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle both options `--set-upstream` and `-u` correctly by removing both instances if they are found in the input command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments from the command
    for option in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove argument for the option
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will properly check for and remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments from the command script parts if they are present. This will ensure that the new command constructed is correct and matches the expected behavior.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to suggestions for `git push -u`, ensuring that the correct suggestion is provided when using the `thefuck` command.
