The cause of the bug in the function `get_new_command` is the improper handling of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the `command.script_parts` list. The buggy function is incorrectly trying to remove both the flag and its argument by using pop twice at the same index. This approach does not work as intended, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `command.stderr` may not always have the expected format, so we should check and handle such scenarios as well.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument if present
    for index, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            # Check if there is an argument after the flag to remove
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)
            break

    if 'fatal: The current branch' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None  # Handle cases where command.stderr does not contain the expected message
```

This corrected version of the function properly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. It also includes additional handling for cases where the `command.stderr` does not contain the expected message format.

The corrected function should now produce the expected output for all the provided test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to suggestions for `git push -u origin` commands.
