Based on the information provided, it seems the bug in the function stems from the following:
1. The code is attempting to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u', but it overwrites the index value each time, leading to potential issues.
2. The pop operation to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument is not correctly handling the removal of the items.
3. The variable 'push_upstream' incorrectly extracts the suggested command, considering the last line of command.stderr without taking into account the correct format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all relevant indexes are handled correctly without overwriting, the pop operation removes the correct items, and 'push_upstream' extracts the command properly.

Here is an updated version of the function that should address the bug:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # remove the corresponding argument as well
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()[4:]  # extract the correct push command from stderr
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument, as well as extract the correct push command from `command.stderr`.

Please test this updated function with the provided test cases to ensure that it now produces the expected output.
