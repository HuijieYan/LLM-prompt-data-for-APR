The buggy function has an issue with handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options along with their arguments correctly. The function incorrectly removes both occurrences of the option instead of just the one associated with the index found. This leads to incorrect command formation in the end.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing the correct index of the option. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
            
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument associated with the option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately and removes the correct occurrence along with its argument. This ensures that the final command formed is accurate based on the input parameters provided.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases to ensure it now produces the expected output.
