### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle the case where the user enters `git push -u origin`, which triggers an error message specifying how to set the upstream branch. The function attempts to extract the suggested command from the error message and then remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option from the command. However, the function has the following issues:
1. In the initial implementation, the check for the presence of `-u` overrides the result of the check for `--set-upstream`.
2. The removal of the upstream option from the command script parts is incorrect.
3. The extraction of the push command from the error message is not precise.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option from the command script parts. This leads to incorrect handling of the provided command and ultimately results in an inaccurate suggestion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the implementation to correctly handle the cases of both `-u` and `--set-upstream`.
2. Update the removal of the upstream option from the command script parts.
3. Enhance the extraction of the push command from the error message to get the accurate command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Set of potential upstream options to check
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    push_upstream = None
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)
            push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break
    
    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # If the upstream option was not found, return the command as is
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

### Testing:
The corrected function should be tested with the provided test cases to ensure that it handles the issues correctly and provides the expected output in all scenarios.
