The bug in the function lies in the incorrect handling of removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument from the command script parts. The bug causes the function to incorrectly construct the push command when suggesting a fix.

The buggy function fails to properly handle the case where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag is included in the command script parts. It does not accurately identify the index of the flag and its argument to remove them from the script parts before constructing the new push command.

To fix the bug:
1. Properly identify the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument in the command script parts.
2. Remove the flag and its argument from the script parts if they exist.
3. Retrieve the correct push command from the stderr output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Identify the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the script parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # If the index is found, remove the flag and its argument from the script parts
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Retrieve the correct push command from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument, resulting in the correct construction of the new push command. The function should now satisfy all the expected cases provided.
