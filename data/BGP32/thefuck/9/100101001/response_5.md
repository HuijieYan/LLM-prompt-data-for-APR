### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from a `git push` command and use the suggestion provided by git for the push command. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to failing tests. 

1. The handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option removal is incorrect.
2. The extraction of the suggested push command from the stderr is not accurate.
3. The composition of the new command is incomplete.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the script parts of the command only contain `['git', 'push']`. The stderr of the command mentions the suggested `git push` command as `git push --set-upstream origin master`, which is correctly extracted by `push_upstream`. 

The bug lies in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The removal is attempted by popping the index of the option twice, which is unnecessary and results in an incorrect reconstructed command. Additionally, the reconstructed command is missing the actual push action, which leads to failing test cases.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` option to remove it only once when found.
2. Enhance the extraction of the suggested push command from stderr to ensure accuracy.
3. Include the actual push action in the reconstructed command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return f"git {push_upstream}"
```

With this corrected version, the function will extract the correct push command, remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option once, and reconstruct the new command by including the actual push action.
