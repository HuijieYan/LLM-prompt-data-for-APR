### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that the code to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is incorrect. The current implementation is trying to remove the option and its argument by popping twice from the `command.script_parts`, which is removing two elements regardless of whether they are the option and its argument or not.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the provided test case:
   ```
   assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)) == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
   ```
   - The input command is `'git push -u'` which has the `'-u'` option.
   - The expected output indicates that the `'-u'` option should be replaced with `'--set-upstream origin master'`.

2. Variables at the buggy function's return for this test case:
   - `upstream_option_index` is set to `-1`, indicating that the `'-u'` option is not found in `command.script_parts`.
   - `push_upstream` is `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, which is taken from the `stderr`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should properly check for the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, remove it along with its argument, and then replace it with the correct value extracted from `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace(' --set-upstream', '')
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly removes the option and its argument when found, extracts the correct value from `command.stderr`, and replaces the option with the extracted value, which should now pass the failing test cases.
