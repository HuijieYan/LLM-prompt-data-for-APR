### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be with how the `upstream_option_index` is being used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` may not always be accurate.

### Cause of the Bug
1. In the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts`, the `upstream_option_index` is set incorrectly, resulting in the removal of only one option instead of both.
2. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` is relying on splitting the output based on newline characters and selecting the value from a specific index, which may not be reliable if the output structure changes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the code to correctly handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present by iterating over the list of script parts and handling both cases separately.
2. Improve the extraction of the `push_upstream` value by using a more robust method that can accurately identify the necessary information.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream and -u along with their arguments
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the correct push_upstream value
    potential_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(potential_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.lstrip()
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the suggested changes above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the different cases more accurately and pass the failing tests.
