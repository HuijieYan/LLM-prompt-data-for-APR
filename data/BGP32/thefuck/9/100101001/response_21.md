### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. The code is currently attempting to remove the options by directly accessing their index in the list, which can lead to issues when both options are present or not present in the command.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section of code where the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are being removed from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Properly handle the cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present or not present in the command.
- Update the code logic to adjust the removal indices correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the `in` keyword to check for the presence of the options and `remove` method to remove them, we can ensure that the correct options are removed without the issues present in the original implementation. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
