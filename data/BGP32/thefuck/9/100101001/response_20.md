### Potential Error Location
1. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument seems to be incorrect as it currently removes the option twice in case it is present.
2. The extraction of the `push_upstream` part from the `stderr` might not be accurate, leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. The `push_upstream` extraction from the `stderr` might be flawed, leading to incorrect parsing of the necessary argument.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correct the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument to ensure it is only removed once if present in the command.
2. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` to accurately capture the necessary information.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if there is an argument following the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if there is an argument following the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these corrections, the function should now properly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as accurately extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr`, addressing the issue causing the failing tests.
