### Identified issues:
1. The code is incorrectly checking if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present in the script parts of the command but is removing them incorrectly leading to incorrect results.
2. The extraction of the push_upstream command from the stderr is not accurately capturing the required information resulting in incorrect output.

### Cause of the bug:
The upstream_option_index is being incorrectly set to -1 if '-u' is not found in the script_parts. Additionally, pop method is being used twice which might lead to issues in correctly removing the arguments.
The extraction of the push_upstream command from stderr is imprecise as it is not considering all possible variations resulting in incorrect output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the approach to check for '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the command accurately.
2. Ensure the correct removal of the options by considering the index of the found option and removing it only once.
3. Extract the push_upstream command accurately from the stderr string considering variations in text.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    # Check for '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now accurately remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command arguments and extract the push_upstream command correctly from the stderr.
