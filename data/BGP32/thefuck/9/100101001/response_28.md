### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify a Git push command, specifically removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command, and replacing it with the suggested push command based on the Git error message. 

From the provided test case and runtime values, we can see that the function fails to correctly handle the removal of the upstream option and its argument. Additionally, it doesn't appropriately extract the suggested push command from the error message.

### Bugs:
1. The function incorrectly handles the removal of the upstream option and its argument.
2. The extraction of the suggested push command from the error message is not accurate.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for detecting and removing the upstream option and its argument.
2. Improve the extraction of the suggested push command from the error message.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for index, part in enumerate(command_parts):
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            command_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command_parts):
                command_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument too

    # Extract the suggested push command from the error message
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        line = line.strip()
        if line.startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git push --set-upstream ')[2]
            break
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these adjustments in the function, the corrected version should now handle the removal of the upstream option and its argument properly, and accurately extract the suggested push command from the error message. Thus, the failing tests should pass with this corrected implementation.
