### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrectly handling the search for '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command arguments.
2. Incorrectly extracting the push upstream command from stderr.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from incorrectly searching for and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, as well as extracting the push upstream command from the stderr. This leads to incorrect output in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are correctly identified and removed from the command arguments.
2. Update the extraction of the push upstream command from stderr to get the correct value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()

    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' if present in the command arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        command_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command_parts:
        command_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the push upstream command correctly
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing tests should now pass successfully.
