### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, the script is incorrectly removing the same element twice from the `command.script_parts` list. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following section of code:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `pop` method within the `if` condition. By popping the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, it results in removing the same element twice in a row from the list `command.script_parts`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the popping strategy for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. We should only pop the element once, especially since both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options will always have an argument that should also be removed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Also remove the argument of the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the `get_new_command` function should now correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, ensuring that the output is as expected and passes the failing test cases.
