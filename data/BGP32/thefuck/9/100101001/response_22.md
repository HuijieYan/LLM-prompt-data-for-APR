### Identified Bug:

The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`. The code is not correctly removing both the option and its argument from the list when either of them is present in the `command.script_parts`. This leads to incorrect behavior when constructing the new command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`, both the option and its argument are correctly removed from the list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, each occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument will be correctly removed from `command.script_parts`, ensuring that the new command is constructed accurately.

By using this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
