### Analysis
The function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the given command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments and replacing the `push` command argument with the suggested upstream branch. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments is incorrect, as it does not handle the case when both flags are present correctly.
2. The extraction of the suggested upstream branch from `command.stderr` is assuming a specific format of the error message, leading to an incorrect value being extracted.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the function fails because the extraction of the suggested upstream branch from `command.stderr` does not match the expected value provided in the test. Additionally, the `upstream_option_index` variable does not indicate the correct index to remove the argument corresponding to `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments to handle cases where both flags are present correctly.
2. Improve the extraction of the suggested upstream branch from `command.stderr` to ensure the correct value is obtained.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested upstream branch correctly
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[1] + ' ' + command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should now handle both cases correctly and return the expected values for the given failing test.
