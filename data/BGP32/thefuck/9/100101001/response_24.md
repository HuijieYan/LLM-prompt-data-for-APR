### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify a git push command based on the output of the git push operation. It tries to remove the --set-upstream or -u option from the command and then construct a new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the suggested value obtained from the stderr of the command.

- The bug occurs in the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the `command.script_parts` list. 
- The current implementation removes the option at `upstream_option_index`, but then incorrectly removes the element again at the same index, resulting in an index out of range error.
- Additionally, the logic to extract the suggested value for the push command from the stderr is incorrect, as it does not consider the exact format of the message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Correctly remove only the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the `command.script_parts` list once.
2. Update the logic to extract the suggested push command value from the stderr appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and extract the push command suggestion from the stderr. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
