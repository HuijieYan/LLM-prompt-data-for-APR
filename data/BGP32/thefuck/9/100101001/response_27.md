### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This removal is supposed to happen because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which already includes `--set-upstream` and its argument. However, the current implementation removes the argument twice and also does not handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument is not present in the command.

### Bug Explanation:
In Case 1, with the input `command.script_parts` as `['git', 'push']` and `command.stderr` containing the suggestion for setting up the upstream branch, the function incorrectly identifies `upstream_option_index` as `-1`. This leads to not removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The `push_upstream` variable is extracted correctly from the `command.stderr`, but the resulting command constructed by `replace_argument` is incorrect.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. We should also handle cases where these arguments are not present in the command correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if present
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the flag
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove its argument
            break  # Exit loop after successfully removing the flag and its argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function iterates over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, and if found, removes the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This fix ensures that the correct command is constructed without duplicating or leaving out any arguments.
