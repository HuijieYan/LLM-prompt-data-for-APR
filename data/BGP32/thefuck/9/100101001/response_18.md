The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` variable is being updated and checked. The issue is that the second `try` block to find the index of `-u` is executed regardless of the result of the first `try` block that searches for `--set-upstream`. This means that if `--set-upstream` is found, the index of `-u` is also checked, potentially leading to incorrect index removals.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only if `--set-upstream` is not found, then attempt to find the index of `-u`.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and remove them when constructing the new command.
