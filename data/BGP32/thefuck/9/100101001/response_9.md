### Potential Error Locations:
1. The code checking for the existence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options appears to have an issue. If the `-u` option is present, it will always override the value set by `--set-upstream`. The code currently does not handle this correctly.
2. There might be an issue with how the script is parsing the output from `git push` to get the correct upstream branch.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to arise from the fact that the code does not handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command. Additionally, the method of extracting the upstream branch from stderr might not be accurate.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the command.
2. Improve the method to extract the upstream branch from the stderr of the `git push` command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation of Changes Made:
1. The code now correctly handles the case where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present.
2. The extraction of the upstream branch from stderr has been updated to `[-2]` index to match the correct line that contains the information. The `partition('git ')[2]` is used to capture the correct output containing the upstream branch.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
