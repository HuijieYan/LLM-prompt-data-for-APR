### Error location:
The bug in the function lies in how it handles removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. The function incorrectly removes the option and its argument by popping twice, which leads to an incorrect command being returned.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The function wrongly assumes that both options (`--set-upstream` and `-u`) will not be present in the `command.script_parts` simultaneously. Thus, if the first `try` block finds `--set-upstream`, the second `try` block will not execute, and vice versa. However, if both options are present, the second one will overwrite the result from the first `try` block.
2. After removing the options from `script_parts`, the function incorrectly derives the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr`, splitting it without considering variations like '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the output, leading to incorrect extraction.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of popping twice, use the index found to remove only the option detected (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) from `command.script_parts`.
2. Extract the `push_upstream` value directly from `command.stderr` based on the correct pattern matching.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from script_parts if present
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct push_upstream value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle removing the options and extracting the `push_upstream` value, providing the expected result for the failing tests.
