The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` lies in the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts. The code is currently removing the option and argument at the same index, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. Identify the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument.
2. Remove both the option and argument separately from the command script parts.
3. Extract the correct push upstream part from the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # When removing the option, also remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the correct push upstream part from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition(' ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument correctly, and extract the push upstream part accurately from the stderr, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
