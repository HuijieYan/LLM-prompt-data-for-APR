### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is trying to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are passed in the `git push` command.
2. The function searches for the index of these flags in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them if found.
3. The function then extracts the upstream branch information from the `stderr` of the command and replaces the "push" argument with it.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the upstream_option_index is handled and the usage of pop() method.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to occur because the script_parts list is modified while iterating over it to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags. This leads to incorrect indexing and removal of elements in the list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid modifying the `command.script_parts` list directly while iterating over it.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle multiple occurrences of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags.
3. Improve error handling to cover edge cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Make a copy to avoid modifying the original list

    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u flags
    script_parts = [arg for arg in script_parts if arg not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    # Extract upstream branch information from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Construct the new command by replacing the "push" argument with the upstream branch
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return new_command
```

Now the function avoids directly modifying the `command.script_parts` list and correctly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
