To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is not correctly handling the cases when the command includes '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags.
2. The function is assuming that the output of `git push` error message will always contain the information we need to construct the new command.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    git_push_output = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    push_upstream = git_push_output.partition('git ')[2]
    
    new_command = ' '.join(script_parts)
    if push_upstream:
        new_command = replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_upstream)

    return new_command
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the cases where "--set-upstream" or "-u" flags are in the command more accurately and construct the new command based on the output of `git push` command error message.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
