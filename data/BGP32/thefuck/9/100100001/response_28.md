First, let's analyze the buggy function:
1. The function `get_new_command` is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `command` object as input.
2. It looks for the indices of `--set-upstream` or `-u` within the `command.script_parts` list.
3. If found, it removes these options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.
4. It extracts the upstream branch name from the stderr of the `command`.
5. It then replaces the argument for the "push" command with the upstream branch name.

The potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The logic to find the index of `upstream_option_index` is not taking into account that the second condition might overwrite the first one which might lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The way upstream branch name is being fetched from command's stderr might not be reliable if the stderr format changes.

The bug likely occurs due to the rebinding of `upstream_option_index` when the second condition overrides the first one. This causes only the `-u` option to be recognized, leading to issues. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to set `upstream_option_index` only if it is not found previously.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, as intended.
