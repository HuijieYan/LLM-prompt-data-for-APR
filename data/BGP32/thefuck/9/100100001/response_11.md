## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. However, the bug lies in the way it handles the removal of those options. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the removal of the options, leading to incorrect output.

## Issues
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is checked using `is not -1`, which may not work as intended.
2. The removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is not handled properly.
3. The `push_upstream` variable is extracted in an incorrect manner by splitting `stderr`.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from not correctly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts`. When attempting to remove these options from the command, the function does not handle the removal of the option along with its argument correctly. This issue results in an unexpected final command output.

## Strategy for Fixing
1. Ensure correct identification of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts`.
2. Properly handle the removal of the option and its argument from the script parts.
3. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` for accurate results.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

## Updated Test
After applying the corrections to the `get_new_command` function, the provided test function should no longer fail and should produce the correct output for each `git push` command configuration.
