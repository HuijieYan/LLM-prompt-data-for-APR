The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command. The issue arises from the fact that if both options are present, the function will always remove the argument corresponding to the last option found, regardless of which option was initially detected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for removing the argument associated with the detected option. We should ensure that the correct argument is removed based on the option found. We can accomplish this by keeping track of the index of the option found and then removing the argument at that specific index.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    # Check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument based on the detected index
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if there is still another element at the index
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should now handle the removal of the correct argument associated with the detected option, ensuring that the tests in `test_git_push.py` pass as expected.
