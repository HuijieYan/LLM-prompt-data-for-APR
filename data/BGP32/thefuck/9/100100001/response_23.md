The buggy function fails to correctly handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are passed in the command. The bug is caused by the second try block overwriting the value of 'upstream_option_index' if both options are present in the command, leading to only the last option index being used for removal.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to handle both options separately and remove them from the 'command.script_parts' list. Additionally, we need to extract the 'push_upstream' from the correct line of the `stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command_parts.index(option)
            command_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the option
            command_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the correct push_upstream from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('git ')[-1].strip()

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes in place, the corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
