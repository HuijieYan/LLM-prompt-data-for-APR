## Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present. It also extracts the suggested git command from the stderr of the original command and replaces the argument in the modified command.
- The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is being updated, leading to incorrect removal of the option and its argument.

## Error Locations:
1. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is not checking both possible index findings properly.
2. The removal of the upstream option and its argument is done incorrectly, as it only pops the index without considering the argument next to it.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the function causes incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument. This leads to mismatched indices and incorrect modification of the command, causing the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly check for both option indices.
2. Modify the code to correctly remove both the option and its argument when found.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indices = []
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            upstream_option_indices.extend([upstream_option_index, upstream_option_index+1])
        except ValueError:
            pass
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function will properly find and remove both the option and its argument when present, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
