## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the command script parts list. The issue occurs when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command, as both conditions modify the `upstream_option_index`, leading to only the last flag being removed. This results in incorrect command construction.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only the first occurrence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is removed from the command script parts list. We can achieve this by using separate `if` conditions for checking the presence of these flags, updating the upstream option index only if it has not been set before.

## Corrected version of the `get_new_command` function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By fixing the logic to handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly, the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
