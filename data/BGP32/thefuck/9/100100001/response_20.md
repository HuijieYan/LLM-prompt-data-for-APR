## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present, and then replacing the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch. The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is being updated and the incorrect removal of elements from `command.script_parts`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that when processing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, the code is removing the elements from `command.script_parts` incorrectly. It is popping the same index twice, which may lead to missing arguments in the resulting command.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument correctly. We should remove both the option and its argument at the correct index once. Also, we need to ensure that the `push_upstream` is extracted correctly to replace the `push` argument in the final command.

## Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split('\'')[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and argument and properly extracting the `push_upstream`, we can ensure that the function works correctly and passes the failing test.
