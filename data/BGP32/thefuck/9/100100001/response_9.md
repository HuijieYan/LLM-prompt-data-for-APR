## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present, then constructing a new command by replacing the argument with the push destination extracted from the stderr of the original command.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument may be causing index out of range errors if the options are not present in the `command.script_parts`.
   - Extracting the push destination from the third last line of the `stderr` might cause issues if the stderr does not have enough lines or the information is not as expected.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument in the `command.script_parts` list. If these options are not present, the index error occurs when trying to remove them. Additionally, parsing the `stderr` for the push destination assumption is faulty, as the assumption about the third-to-last line containing the push destination might not always hold true.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of directly trying to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u`, first check if they exist in the list before attempting to remove them.
2. Use a more robust method to extract the push destination from the `stderr` to ensure the correct destination is obtained.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are passed and remove them
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    # Extract push destination from stderr
    push_destination = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith('Push'):
            push_destination = line.split()[-1].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_destination)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the command and extract the push destination more reliably from the `stderr`.
