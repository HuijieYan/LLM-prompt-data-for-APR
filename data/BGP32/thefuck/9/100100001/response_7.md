The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, then extract the suggested push upstream branch from the `stderr`, and finally replace it in the command.

The bug in the function is that it incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The code is popping the same index twice and not correctly removing both the option and its argument.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` option and its argument when found in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it's good to handle cases where the index is out of range.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command

    # Check if the index is within range before removing
    if upstream_index < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        if upstream_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass as the bug causing incorrect removal of the option and its argument has been fixed.
