### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and replacing the push action with the upstream branch being pushed to.
- The function uses `command.script_parts` to manipulate the command parts, extracts the upstream branch name from the stderr output of the command, and then replaces the push action with the received upstream branch.
- The bug seems to be related to how the script parts are manipulated and the extraction of the upstream branch.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The removal of the `-u` argument is not working as expected.
2. Incorrect extraction of the upstream branch from stderr.

### Bug Cause:
1. When removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument, the index removal logic in the code is flawed due to popping twice without adjusting the index properly. This causes misalignment in the command parts.
2. The extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr might not always be accurate, leading to incorrect replacement in the command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument to ensure correct index manipulation.
2. Improve the extraction of the upstream branch from stderr for accuracy.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # The remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there is an argument to be removed
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)  # Replace the push action with upstream branch
```

### Test Result:
After applying the corrections to the `get_new_command` function, the failing test should now pass without any issues.
