Fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("--set-upstream")
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("-u")
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split("\n")[-3].strip().partition("git ")[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), "push", push_upstream)
```

Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the original function `get_new_command` is that it only removes the `--set-upstream` option from the command, but it doesn't handle removing the argument that follows the option. This results in incorrect command reconstruction. The function also incorrectly handles the removal of the `-u` option.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately in the `command.script_parts`.
2. If either option is found, remove both the option and its argument.
3. Update the index manipulation to correctly remove both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.

By implementing the corrected version of the function as shown above, the bug should be resolved and the function should now pass the failing test.
