The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few issues:
1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` is incorrect. It uses two separate try-except blocks, which will always set `upstream_option_index` to the last value found (either `--set-upstream` or `-u`). This will not correctly identify the index of the desired option.
2. The double pop operations on `command.script_parts` after finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` are incorrect and may lead to removing multiple elements from the list.
3. The calculation of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` assumes specific positioning in the split result, which is risky.

To fix the bug:
1. Use a single try-except block to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` while handling both cases.
2. Use `remove` function to remove the element at the correct index instead of using `pop` twice.
3. Modify the logic to extract `push_upstream` in a safer way from `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u in command.script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # If the option is found, remove it
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    # Extract push_upstream
    push_upstream = ""
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith("git push"):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the logic of finding and removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` correctly and extract `push_upstream` more reliably from `command.stderr`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
