The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect handling of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The code tries to find the index of the option using `index` method, but instead, it should use `enumerate` to iterate through the script parts and find the index. Additionally, when removing the option and its argument, the code is using the same index for both removals, which is incorrect.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Find the index of the option in script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            upstream_option_index = i
            break

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The corrected function should pass the failing test provided.
