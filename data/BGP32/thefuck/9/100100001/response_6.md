There are a couple of potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is flawed as it replaces the index if either of the options is found, resulting in incorrect removal of arguments.
2. The logic for extracting the push_upstream command from stderr may not be reliable if the stderr format varies.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command arguments. The function incorrectly removes both the option and its argument, leading to the incorrect command formation.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to handle '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately.
2. Update the logic for extracting the push_upstream command to ensure its correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if '--set-upstream' option is present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    # Check if '-u' option is present
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        # Remove the argument associated with the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract push_upstream command more reliably from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace('\'', '')
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass successfully.
