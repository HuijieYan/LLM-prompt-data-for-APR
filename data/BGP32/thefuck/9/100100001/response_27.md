The buggy function `get_new_command` has the following issues:
1. It doesn't handle the case when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is not present in the command.
2. It doesn't extract the correct upstream information from the stderr output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    new_command = "git push"
    if push_upstream:
        new_command += " --set-upstream " + push_upstream

    return new_command
```

With the above correction, the function will now handle cases where the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is not present in the command, and it will extract the correct upstream information from the stderr output. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test provided.
