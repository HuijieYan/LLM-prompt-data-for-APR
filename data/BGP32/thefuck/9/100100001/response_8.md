## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the provided command based on the stderr output of the git command. The function tries to find and remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command arguments, if present. It then extracts the suggested upstream branch from the stderr and replaces the current upstream branch in the command. However, the bug lies in the way the `upstream_option_index` is updated and how the `push_upstream` is extracted.

## Bugs:
1. The indexing logic to find `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is incorrect. The code mistakenly overwrites the `upstream_option_index` regardless of whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, leading to potential loss of information.
   
2. The calculation of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` is also faulty. It tries to extract the upstream branch from a specific position in the `stderr`, which could potentially break if the format of `stderr` changes or there are additional lines printed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the search for `--set-upstream` or `-u` options to correctly check for both and update the index appropriately.
   
2. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` from `stderr` by finding a more robust and reliable way to extract the suggested branch, possibly using regex or a more dynamic approach.

## Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

regex = r"git push (--set-upstream|-u) (\w*)"
import re


@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find --set-upstream or -u and remove from command arguments
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)

    # Get the suggested upstream branch from the stderr using regex
    match = re.search(regex, command.stderr)
    push_upstream = None
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(2)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function uses a regex pattern to extract the suggested branch name from the `stderr` of the git command. It also correctly iterates over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options to remove them from the command arguments. This should fix the bugs and make the function work as intended.
