## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle Git push commands and modify them accordingly to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replace the "push" command with the actual branch name.

### Identified Issues:
1. The code is using two separate `try` blocks to check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The indexing of the `pop` function is incorrect as it should remove the argument after the option being removed.
3. The extraction of the branch name from the stderr is assuming a specific format which is not robust.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect indexing and handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options while manipulating the command arguments. Additionally, the assumption about the format of stderr for extracting the branch name is not accurate.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a single `try` block to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. Adjust the indexing for removing the argument after the option.
3. Use a more robust method to extract the branch name from the stderr.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for index, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            upstream_option_index = index
            
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its associated argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the branch name from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split(' ')[-1]
    
    # Replace the "push" command with the actual branch name
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By addressing the issues mentioned above, the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should now handle Git push commands correctly and pass the failing test.
