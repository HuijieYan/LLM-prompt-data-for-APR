The issue stems from how the `get_new_command` function handles the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options within the `command.script_parts`. The code incorrectly removes the option and its argument, causing the issue with generating the correct suggestion for the git push command. To fix this bug, we need to make sure that we remove both the option and its argument correctly and extract the desired push upstream command from the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is done correctly, preserving the integrity of the remaining command parts. Additionally, it extracts the desired push upstream command from the stderr message as intended.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves correctly for all the provided test cases.
