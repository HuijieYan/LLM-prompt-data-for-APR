### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to handle the command output from a failed `git push` operation and suggest the correct command to set the remote as the upstream branch. The function identifies if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options were passed in the `git push` command and removes them along with their arguments. It then extracts the correct push command from the stderr output of the failed `git push`.

### Bugs:
1. The function incorrectly removes both the option and its argument at the same index, which may cause issues.
2. The function extracts the push command from the wrong position in the stderr output, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly remove only the option and its argument when identified.
2. Extract the correct push command from the correct position in the stderr output.

### Code fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break  # Exit loop if option found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function now correctly removes the specified option and its argument if found. It extracts the push command from the correct position in the stderr output to suggest the correct upstream branch setup command. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
