### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify the command passed as input by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present and its argument. It then extracts the correct push command to be used and returns it.

### Error Location:
1. The if condition for checking if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` is incorrect as it should be written as `!=` instead of `is not`.
2. The pop operation on `command.script_parts` should be done on consecutive indices based on the identified option, but the current implementation pops the same index twice.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the flag removal and its argument, resulting in an improper final push command. The incorrect if condition check and faulty pop operations lead to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the `if` condition to check for `!= -1` instead of `is not -1`.
2. Adjust the pop operations to remove the identified option and its argument consecutively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now handle the input cases correctly based on the expected values and types provided.
