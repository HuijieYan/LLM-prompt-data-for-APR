### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to process the command output from `git push` and suggest a corrected command by removing specific arguments like `--set-upstream` and `-u`. The bug seems to lie in how the function handles the removal of these arguments and concatenation of the corrected command.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the current implementation arises due to the way the function checks for and removes the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the command. The function uses separate try-except blocks to search for each option, but the removal process is incorrect as it pops the elements from the `script_parts` list incorrectly, resulting in incorrect concatenation of the final command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using two separate try-except blocks, we should combine the logic to handle both options in a single block.
2. When removing elements from the list, ensure that the correct indices are used to maintain the integrity of the remaining elements.
3. Concatenate the corrected command properly after removing the unnecessary options.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    corrected_command = ['git', 'push', push_upstream]
    return ' '.join(corrected_command)
```

By implementing the correct removal of options and concatenation of the final command, the corrected function should now provide the expected output for all the test cases provided.
