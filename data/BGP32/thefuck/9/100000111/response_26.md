### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify git push commands by removing certain options and arguments. The main issue arises when trying to identify the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option within the command script parts. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where both options are present. Additionally, the extraction of the 'push_upstream' value from the stderr output may not be reliable.

### Identified Bug
1. Incorrect handling of multiple occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options within the script parts.
2. Extraction of 'push_upstream' from stderr may not retrieve the expected string reliably.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the function only considering the last index found for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the script parts. This causes issues when both options are present. Additionally, the extraction of 'push_upstream' relies on assuming a fixed position within the stderr output without proper verification.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use a loop to search for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options within the script parts and handle the removal of all occurrences properly.
2. Improve the extraction of 'push_upstream' by searching for the specific pattern in the stderr output.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            while True:
                upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git push ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to handling multiple occurrences of options and improves the extraction of 'push_upstream' from the stderr output. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
