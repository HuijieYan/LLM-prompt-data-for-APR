### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to modify the git push command suggested by the `thefuck` tool by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options as they are already provided by the initial git push output. The function then constructs the new git push command using the remaining parts of the original command and the output provided.

### Identified Error:
The main issue in the buggy function is with the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The current implementation removes the options and their arguments incorrectly, leading to an incorrect command generation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their associated arguments from the command script when they are present. This leads to the concatenated new command being constructed incorrectly, including parts that should have been removed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and arguments from the command script.
2. Retrieve the correct push upstream information to construct the new command without the removed options.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract the corrected git push command from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options along with their arguments from the command script and construct the new git push command correctly based on the provided output.
