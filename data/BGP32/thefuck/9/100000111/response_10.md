### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument from the command arguments list if present. Then, it extracts the suggested git push command from the stderr message to be used in constructing the new command.

### Bugs:
1. The conditions to check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` are not properly handled. If one is found, the code should stop looking for the other as both can't be present simultaneously.
2. Removing the elements should consider the index of the elements properly.
3. The extraction logic for the `push_upstream` variable assumes a fixed format of the error message, which may not always be the case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditions to handle `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately.
2. Adjust the index used for removing elements properly.
3. Enhance the logic for extracting the suggested git push command to ensure it's more robust.

### Code Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    
    parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for part in parts[::-1]:
        if part.strip().startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = part.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break
    else:
        # If the suggested command is not found, fallback to a default message
        push_upstream = 'origin master'
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the command arguments properly, remove the unnecessary options, and extract the suggested git push command more reliably.
