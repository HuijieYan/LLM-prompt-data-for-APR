The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The code does not correctly handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present in the command.
2. The index removal from the `command.script_parts` list is incorrect as it removes both the option flag and its argument instead of doing it once.
3. The extraction of the 'push_upstream' value from `command.stderr` is not robust and may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is in the `command.script_parts` list and remove it properly.
2. Improve the extraction of the 'push_upstream' value from `command.stderr` to ensure correct parsing.
3. Update the 'push_upstream' value using the extracted information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are in the script_parts list and remove them properly
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('fatal: ')[1].split('.')[0].split('use\n\n')[1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the different scenarios correctly as described in the expected input/output values and satisfy the GitHub issues raised.
