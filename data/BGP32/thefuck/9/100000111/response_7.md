### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify the `git push` command by replacing the push argument with the push upstream value extracted from the stderr of the command. It also attempts to handle cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the command and remove them.

### Error:
1. The code handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags incorrectly. If both flags are present, it removes only one of them, which can lead to an incorrect command.
2. The function incorrectly calculates `upstream_option_index`. Even if `-u` flag is found, it still searches for `--set-upstream`, causing issues with subsequent removal logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code logic to correctly remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags when identified.
2. Correct the calculation of `upstream_option_index` to prevent unnecessary removal of arguments.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove both occurrences and their arguments.
    command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Extract the push upstream value from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected code ensures that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are removed when present in the command. It also correctly calculates `upstream_option_index` without disrupting the removal logic.
