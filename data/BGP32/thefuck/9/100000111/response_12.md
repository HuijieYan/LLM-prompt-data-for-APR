### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands and modify them accordingly. The function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command, as they are already implied by the actual git command output. Additionally, it extracts the suggested command from the stderr of the command.

### Error:
1. The code does not correctly handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command, leading to index errors.
2. The logic to extract the push command from `command.stderr` is flawed, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The first error mentioned results from the index removal process of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags. If both exist, popping at the same index causes the second occurrence to be skipped. The inconsistency in parsing `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` causes the incorrect push command to be generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags from the command script_parts.
2. Refine the logic to extract the suggested push command from the stderr of the command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove both --set-upstream and -u flags and their arguments
    command_script = command.script_parts.copy()
    while '--set-upstream' in command_script:
        upstream_index = command_script.index('--set-upstream')
        command_script.pop(upstream_index)
        command_script.pop(upstream_index)

    while '-u' in command_script:
        upstream_index = command_script.index('-u')
        command_script.pop(upstream_index)
        command_script.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[-3:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_script), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```

This corrected function addresses the issues mentioned, ensuring proper removal of flags and their arguments. It also refines the parsing of the push command from the stderr to generate the correct output.
