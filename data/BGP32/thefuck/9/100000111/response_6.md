The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing the push destination with the suggestion provided by the Git error message. However, the bug lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is determined and used to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The key issues in the buggy function are:
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is assigned twice and overwrites its value when checking for `-u`, resulting in incorrect index identification.
2. The removal of the element at the identified index is incorrect because it shifts the subsequent elements and may lead to removing the wrong element.

To fix the bug, the `upstream_option_index` should be correctly set by checking both options `--set-upstream` and `-u`. Then, the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` should be adjusted to prevent shifting of elements.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = {'--set-upstream', '-u'}
    
    remove_indices = []  # Store the indices to remove
    for opt in upstream_options:
        try:
            opt_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            remove_indices.extend([opt_index, opt_index + 1])  # Add both the option and its argument index to the list
        except ValueError:
            pass

    for idx in sorted(remove_indices, reverse=True):
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Remove the elements in reverse order to prevent shifting

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list without shifting other elements. It then retrieves the desired push suggestion from the Git error message to construct the new command. The function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
