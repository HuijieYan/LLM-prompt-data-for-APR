### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is supposed to process a git push command and extract the suggested push command provided by git when setting up the upstream branch. It tries to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option if present and then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr output.

### Error location & Bug cause

The bug occurs in the logic that removes the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option from the command parts. The issue lies in handling multiple scenarios correctly. The function does not handle the case when both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options are present in the command script_parts.

### Strategy to fix the bug

To correct this bug, we need to modify the code to handle both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options when present in the command script_parts correctly. We should also consider scenarios where these options might occur at different positions.

### Corrected Version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function now iterates over both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options, removing them and their arguments if present. This ensures that the function handles all cases where these options might occur, meeting the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
