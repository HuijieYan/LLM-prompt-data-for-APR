### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and adjust the remaining parts accordingly. However, the bug is causing issues with extracting the correct `push_upstream` value from the `stderr`.

### Error Location
The error seems to be in the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]`. Extracting using a fixed index position might not work reliably.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from assuming the position of the relevant information in the `stderr` output of the `git push` command. The hardcoded index `-3` is causing the extraction to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to find a more reliable way to extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` output. It would be beneficial to parse the `stderr` output for the exact string that indicates the correct information.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extracting push_upstream value from stderr
    push_upstream = ''
    for line in reversed(command.stderr.split('\n')):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version improves the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` output by searching for a specific string pattern rather than relying on a fixed index. This ensures that the correct information is extracted for all cases.
