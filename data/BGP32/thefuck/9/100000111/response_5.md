### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command passed to suggest an alternative git push command when a branch has no upstream branch. The issue seems to be related to handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command.

### Error Location
1. The values `upstream_option_index` should be set by checking both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, but the second check overwrites the value set by the first check if found, leading to potential issues.
2. The removal of the elements at `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts` is mistakenly happening twice, likely due to an error in removing the previous item.
3. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` might not handle cases where the expected string is not at the specific index `-3`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the command. When both options are present, the second one overwrites the index found by the first one, leading to incorrect processing. Additionally, the removal operation is also flawed, causing items to be removed twice. Lastly, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` relies on an index that may not always contain the desired information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and handle them accordingly.
2. Ensure that any removal operation is done only once for the identified index.
3. Extract `push_upstream` in a more robust way from `command.stderr` to handle variations in the output string.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    
    push_upstream = ''
    stderr_parts = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    for part in reversed(stderr_parts):
        if 'git push' in part:
            push_upstream = part.partition('git ')[2].strip()
            break
            
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options individually, remove them only once, and extract `push_upstream` more robustly from the `command.stderr` output.
