The buggy function is intended to correct the command suggested by git when the push is unsuccessful due to no upstream branch. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' from the command's script parts and deriving the push upstream value from the stderr output.

The bug is present in how the script parts are manipulated to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. The mistake is in the removal process from the script_parts list, where the index for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' is used to remove them. Additionally, there is an issue with deriving the push upstream value from the stderr output, where incorrect slicing and partitioning are done.

To fix the bug, the script_parts list should be correctly adjusted when removing '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, and the correct index should be used. Moreover, the way to extract the push upstream value from the stderr output should be corrected.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' if present in script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the push upstream value from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function adjusts the script_parts list by correctly removing '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and updates the method of extracting the push upstream value from the stderr output. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
