The bug in the function `get_new_command` arises from the incorrect handling of the upstream options `--set-upstream` and `-u`. The function is supposed to remove the upstream options along with their arguments from the command's script parts and then construct a new command with the corrected upstream branch.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly removes the upstream option's argument without considering the actual number of elements to remove from the `command.script_parts` list, leading to potential index out of bounds errors.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly identify the index of the upstream option in the `command.script_parts` list and remove the correct number of elements.
2. Extract the correct upstream branch from the `stderr` output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index + 2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the upstream option and its argument removal accurately and construct the new command string correctly.

The updated function addresses the bug and should satisfy all the expected input/output values, properly handling the upstream options and constructing the corrected command based on the extracted upstream branch.
