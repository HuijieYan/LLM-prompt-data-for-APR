### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function aims to handle Git push commands and modify them as needed. The bug occurs when the function tries to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command, which then concatenates the remaining arguments to the corrected push command suggested by Git.

The bug is in the part where it tries to find the index of the `-u` argument to remove it from the command. The bug arises from not resetting the `upstream_option_index` before checking for the `-u` argument. As a result, if `--set-upstream` is not present in the command but `-u` is present, the function incorrectly assigns the index of `-u` to `upstream_option_index`, leading to incorrect removal and concatenation of arguments in the final command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the `upstream_option_index` is correctly reset before checking for the presence of the `-u` argument.
2. Handle cases where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present correctly to adjust the arguments as expected by the Git push command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Reset the upstream_option_index to -1 before checking for arguments
    upstream_option_index = -1 
    
    try:
        # Find the index of '--set-upstream' and handle any errors
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        # Find the index of '-u' and handle any errors
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the specified argument at the found index
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract and prepare the corrected push command suggested by Git
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Adjust the push command with the new upstream if needed
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function now correctly resets the `upstream_option_index` before checking for either `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments. It accurately removes the specified argument and constructs the corrected push command without any unexpected behavior. This aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue described on GitHub.
