Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, the bug is caused by incorrect handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. The function incorrectly removes the option and its argument when it should keep them in the final command output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly account for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument in the final command output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, keep them in the final command output
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return command.script
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option by keeping it in the final command output. This change ensures that the correct command is returned based on the input parameters.
