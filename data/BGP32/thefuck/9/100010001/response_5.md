The bug in the provided function is due to the fact that the code attempts to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts` when the `upstream_option_index` is found. This causes an `IndexError` since `pop` modifies the list in place, reducing its length after the first `pop` operation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When the `upstream_option_index` is found, the code attempts to pop the same index twice:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

2. When the first `pop` operation is executed, the length of `command.script_parts` decreases, making the second `pop` operation attempt to access an index that is now out of range.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to remove the `pop` operation that is causing the `IndexError` by changing it to just remove the element at the specified index once.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will work correctly by removing the specified element at the `upstream_option_index` once and avoiding the double pop that caused the `IndexError`.
