### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to handle git commands related to pushing changes to a remote repository. The function is designed to extract the new command string based on the error message received when a push operation fails due to a missing upstream branch.

### Error Location:
The main issue causing the error is related to the `IndexError` that occurs in the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line. This error is caused by trying to pop an element from the list that is out of range, leading to an `IndexError`. This issue arises from the incorrect handling of popping elements when trying to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify the index of '-u' when it is present in the command, leading to an incorrect index for popping elements. This causes the `IndexError` as the index is out of range, resulting in the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command script parts. Additionally, the function needs to correctly extract the push upstream branch from the error message to generate the new command.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The corrected function explicitly checks if both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the command script parts before trying to get their indexes.
2. The function correctly handles the removal of these arguments by popping them from the list in the correct order.
3. This approach ensures that the index to pop elements is always within the bounds of the list, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the git push commands correctly without causing any errors.
