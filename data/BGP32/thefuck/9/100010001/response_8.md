The bug occurs because when the `-u` flag is used in the `git push` command, only the first occurrence of `-u` is removed, but then the subsequent removal attempt leads to an `IndexError` because `-u` has already been removed. This causes the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that both occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument are removed from the `command.script_parts`, if they exist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument.
    for option in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the flag
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this revised version, a loop is used to check for both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags, and if found, both the flag and its associated argument are removed effectively. This should now correctly handle commands that use either of these flags without causing an `IndexError`.
