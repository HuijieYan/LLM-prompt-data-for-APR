### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to extract the push destination from the stderr generated by a failed git push command. It first tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` in the command script parts, and if that fails, it attempts to find the index of `-u`. If either of these options is found, it is removed from the command script parts. 

The bug occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an item from a list with an index that is out of range. 

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1` block, where two `pop` operations are being attempted on `command.script_parts` without performing a check against the list length.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the code attempting to pop an index that is out of range in the list `command.script_parts`. This occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is found but then attempted to pop twice without checking to ensure that the indexes are within the valid range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check the length of the list `command.script_parts` before attempting to pop items from it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check again after first pop
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes the additional checks to ensure that the indexes being used for popping elements are valid within the range of `command.script_parts`.
