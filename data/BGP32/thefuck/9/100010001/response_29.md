### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands and modify them accordingly.
- The function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their respective arguments from the command, as the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the suggested command by git.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to call `pop` on a list with an out of range index.
- The bug occurs because the function is calling `pop` twice with the same index, which can cause an attempt to pop from an index that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause:
- The primary cause of the bug in the function is the repeated call to `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. When the `--set-upstream` flag or `-u` flag is found, the function is trying to pop twice with the same index, which results in an `IndexError` when the list is modified the first time.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to change the logic of how the flags and their arguments are removed from the `command.script_parts` list.
- We should ensure that the pop operation is done only once after finding the index of the flag.
- After fixing the removal of the flag, the function should correctly extract the push command from the stderr message and replace it in the modified `command.script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Note:
- In the corrected version, we first check if the flags exist in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to find their indexes and remove them.
- By ensuring that the removal operation is done only once after finding the index of the flag, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy version.
- The corrected function should now handle the git push commands correctly and pass the failing test.
