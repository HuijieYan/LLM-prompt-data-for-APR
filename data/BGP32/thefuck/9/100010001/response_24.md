### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range` at line 27 of the `git_push.py` file. This suggests that the index used in the `.pop()` method is going out of range when attempting to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')` and `upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')` lines may throw `ValueError` if the argument is not found in `command.script_parts`, which leads to `upstream_option_index` having the value of `-1`.
2. The subsequent `.pop()` calls without proper index checking can lead to an `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `--set-upstream` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list. Then, it falls back to searching for `-u`, which also fails. Consequently, both `upstream_option_index` values remain as `-1`. The `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` check allows the subsequent `.pop()` calls to be executed even though the index is out of range, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We should add appropriate checks before calling `.pop()` to ensure that the index to be removed is a valid index within the list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Added a check here
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Added a check here
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Impact:
The corrected version includes checks for valid index removal before calling `.pop()`, preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring. After replacing the buggy function with this corrected version, the failing test should pass successfully.
