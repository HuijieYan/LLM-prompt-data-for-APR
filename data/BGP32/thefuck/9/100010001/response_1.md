### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts. It then extracts the push suggestion from the stderr and replaces the argument in the command script parts with the suggestion.

### Error:
The error occurs when attempting to call `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice after finding the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The code only needs to remove the option and its argument once, but it attempts to remove it twice which leads to an `IndexError` when popping an element that is already removed.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` after the first occurrence of `upstream_option_index`. This way, the removal only happens once as intended.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now work as intended and pass the failing test.
