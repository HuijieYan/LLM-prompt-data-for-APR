### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range` occurring in the buggy function `get_new_command`. 
The main issue in the code is that when the `-u` option is passed in the `git push` command, it is being handled incorrectly. The script tries to `pop` elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the index where `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, assuming it always exists in the list. However, if the `-u` option is not present in the `script_parts`, it will lead to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements at an index that doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should check if the `upstream_option_index` is a valid index (greater than -1) before attempting the `pop` operation. If the `upstream_option_index` is less than 0, it means that `-u` or `--set-upstream` is not present in the `script_parts` list, and we should not perform the `pop` operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if another pop is possible
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding a check to ensure that the index is within range (`if upstream_option_index > -1`) before attempting `pop` operations and verifying another pop is possible, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
