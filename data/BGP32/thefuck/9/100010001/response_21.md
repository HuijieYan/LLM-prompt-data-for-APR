### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify a `git push` command by extracting relevant information from the `stderr` output when a push to an upstream branch fails. The function searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the input command, removes them if found, then extracts the branch names from the `stderr` message.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list using an index that is out of range. This implies that the index stored in `upstream_option_index` is exceeding the length of the list, causing the pop operation to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug lies in the removal of the `upstream_option_index` element from the `command.script_parts` list. When both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command, the program is attempting to pop the same index twice, which causes the list to shrink prematurely and raises an `IndexError` on the second attempt.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of the elements identified by `upstream_option_index`. Since it is possible that both options might be present, we should only remove the element once it is found. Additionally, we need to make sure the index has a valid value before trying to pop it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version addresses the issue by removing the pop operation associated with `upstream_option_index` inside the corresponding `try` block. This ensures that the script parts are only popped if the option is found. Additionally, the program will now properly handle the case where both options are present without causing an `IndexError`.
