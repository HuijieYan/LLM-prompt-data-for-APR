### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` using an index that is out of range. This is likely due to the same index being popped twice consecutively. The buggy function is trying to remove the argument following `--set-upstream` or `-u`, but it is not taking into account the fact that both options are essentially the same in terms of argument handling.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that when it identifies an argument index for either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, it then tries to pop it twice from `command.script_parts`, causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element after already removing it in the first instance.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that once we find the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, we only pop that index once from `command.script_parts`, accounting for the fact that both options should be treated similarly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    query_strings = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    index_to_remove = -1
    for query_string in query_strings:
        try:
            index_to_remove = command.script_parts.index(query_string)
        except ValueError:
            pass

        if index_to_remove != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(index_to_remove)
            break

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and avoid any `IndexError` being raised when popping elements from `command.script_parts`.
