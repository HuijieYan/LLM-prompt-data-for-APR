### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the git push command if present, and then extract the upstream branch name from the stderr message to suggest a corrected git push command. The error message received is an IndexError that occurs when trying to pop an element from a list using an incorrect index.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue in the buggy function lies with the logic related to removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command. The removal is done incorrectly, causing an Index error.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The program tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option using the same index twice, leading to an IndexError.
2. If the command contains both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, it will pop the same index twice, causing the list to shrink more than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix this bug involves making sure that after removing an element from the list, the correct index is considered for the next pop operation. This can be achieved by checking the length of the list before performing the second pop operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
        # Check if there is still an element at that index before attempting to pop again
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the code to account for the list length and adjusting the pop process, the function should now be able to handle the scenario without causing an IndexError.
