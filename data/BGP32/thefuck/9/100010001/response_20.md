The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect removal of elements from the list `command.script_parts`. When checking for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, the function mistakenly tries to modify the list without properly handling the case when the element is not found. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements using the stored index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` variable is only used if a valid index is found for `--set-upstream` or `-u`. Additionally, the check for `upstream_option_index` can be combined into a single check instead of two separate ones.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function now correctly checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, safely removes the elements if found, and avoids the `IndexError` encountered in the failing test case.
