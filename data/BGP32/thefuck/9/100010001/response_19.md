### Analysis:
- The buggy function is trying to extract the upstream branch information from the stderr message provided. It then constructs a new git push command based on the extracted upstream branch.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 37, which suggests that there is an issue with popping an element from the `script_parts` list.
- The issue seems to be related to popping the same index twice, causing the list index to go out of range.
- The goal is to fix the popping logic and ensure that it correctly removes the specific element from the list.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by popping the same index twice in the script. When an index is popped from the list, the list shrinks in size, causing subsequent elements to shift to the left. Popping it again at the same index triggers the IndexError as the index is out of range after the first pop operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic to pop the element once and then adjust the index for further popping.
- Ensure that the index remains within the bounds of the list after each pop operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Adjusting the index after the first pop operation
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### After implementing this corrected version, the provided failing test case should pass without any IndexErrors.
