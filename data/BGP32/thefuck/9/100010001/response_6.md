### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding argument. However, there are some issues in the current implementation:
1. The code is incorrectly trying to pop the same index twice when removing the option and its argument.
2. The `push_upstream` extraction logic from the error message is not checking for the correct index, which leads to an IndexError when trying to extract the command.

### Bug Cause:
The first issue arises because popping the element at `upstream_option_index` twice in a row, which causes an `IndexError` as the list becomes shorter after the first pop operation. The second issue is that the extraction logic for `push_upstream` is incorrectly accessing the wrong index in `command.stderr.split('\n')`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. After identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, remove only once instead of twice.
2. Adjust the extraction logic for `push_upstream` to correctly access the relevant line from the error message.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the `IndexError` by only popping the `upstream_option_index` once. Additionally, we adjusted the `push_upstream` extraction logic to access the correct line from the error message.
