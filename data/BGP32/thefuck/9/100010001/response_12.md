The error message indicates an IndexError occurring at line 27 of the buggy function (thefuck/rules/git_push.py). The issue is with the pop operation on `command.script_parts`, which is trying to pop an element out of range.

The bug occurs because the `upstream_option_index` might be set to -1 (which means the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag is not found), but the code still tries to pop from `command.script_parts` using this index.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the pop operation should only be performed once to remove the flag and its associated argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags are not found properly and avoid the IndexError.
