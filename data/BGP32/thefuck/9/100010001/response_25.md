### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` list in the `get_new_command` function.

### Potential Error Location
The issue is likely happening in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` block, specifically when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts` list.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by attempting to pop an element at `upstream_option_index` twice without reevaluating the list after the first pop operation. This leads to an `IndexError` since the list gets shorter after the first pop operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we only pop elements once they are no longer needed and update the index accordingly. Additionally, we need to make sure that the index is valid before popping the item.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        else:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function first checks if `'--set-upstream'` exists in the `command.script_parts` list. If it does, it removes it. Otherwise, it tries to remove `'-u'` if it exists. This approach ensures that we handle the removal of the options correctly without causing an `IndexError`.
