### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to parse the output of a git command and suggest a corrected command based on it. In this case, it is looking for an `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the `git push` command and removing it if found. Then it retrieves the target branch specified in the error message and replaces the push target branch in the original command.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when the function attempts to pop an element from `command.script_parts` when the index is out of range. This happens because the buggy code is not properly checking if the index exists before trying to remove the element.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by chaining two `try` blocks which both attempt to find the index of the flag (either `--set-upstream` or `-u`). When the first `try` block doesn't find `--set-upstream` and the second `try` block finds `-u`, the index of `--set-upstream` is overwritten by the index of `-u`. Since the first `try` block didn't find `--set-upstream`, the second `try` block sets the `upstream_option_index` to -1 (default value). Later on, it tries to remove the element at index -1 (which is popping out the last element), causing an index out of range error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for finding and removing the flag to ensure it handles both cases (`--set-upstream` and `-u`) properly. We should only remove the flag, if found, and its argument without overwriting the index value.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Correction Justification:
- The corrected function uses an `if-elif` condition to check for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately.
- When either of the flags is found, it removes both the flag and its corresponding argument by popping them from the `script_parts` list.
- This approach prevents the index out of range error by properly handling each flag independently.

Now, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test case without any errors.
