## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process a git push command and handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is included in the command. The function then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr output. 

The error occurs when the function tries to pop the elements at `upstream_option_index` twice. This leads to an `IndexError` when the index is already out of range after the first pop operation. 

## Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by attempting to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we should only pop the element at `upstream_option_index` once and then proceed to process the command. Additionally, we need to correctly handle the case where the `-u` flag is used instead of `--set-upstream`.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly and generate the desired new command based on the stderr output.
