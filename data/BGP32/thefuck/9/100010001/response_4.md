### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, and then replace the `push` command with the value extracted from the `stderr` message starting with `"fatal: The current branch ..."`.

### Bug Identification:
1. The `pop` function is called twice on the same index `upstream_option_index` irrespective of whether the flag was `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Since the `pop` function is called even if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is not included in the command, it raises an `IndexError`.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the second call to `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is redundant. If no `-u` flag is found, but `--set-upstream` is present, the `upstream_option_index` will be set to the index of `-u` resulting in an index out of range error on the second `pop` call.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before performing the second `pop` operation.
2. Only pop the element from the list if that index is found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':  # Check which flag was found
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Only pop if -u was found

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before performing the second pop operation.
2. Added a check to verify if the flag at `upstream_option_index` is `-u` before popping, ensuring that we only pop the `-u` flag if it was found.
