### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring in the `get_new_command` function in the script `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`. The error happens because the `script_parts` list within the `command` object does not contain the index specified for popping elements, resulting in an attempt to pop an index that doesn't exist.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the attempt to pop the same index twice:  
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
This code snippet is trying to remove the same element twice, leading to an index error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from an incorrect assumption that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag will be present in the `script_parts` list of the `command` in every case. If neither of these flags is present, the index is set to `-1`, and trying to `pop` at index `-1`, which is equivalent to trying to `pop` the last element in the list (if it exists), leads to `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before attempting to `pop` elements at that index.
2. Change `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index >= 0` to handle the case where the index exists.
3. Only `pop` the element if the index is valid.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is valid
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above corrections, the `pop` operation will only be executed if there is a valid index to remove from the `command.script_parts` list, resolving the `IndexError` that was occurring.
