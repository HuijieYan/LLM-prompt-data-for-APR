### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process a `git push` command and extract relevant information needed to construct a corrected command by removing unnecessary arguments.
2. The buggy function first tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` in the `command.script_parts` list and then inside a try block, it tries to find the index of `-u` as well. If either is found, it tries to remove them and their corresponding argument from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The specific error message points to an `IndexError` occurring on the second `pop()` function call.
  
### Potential Error Location:
The buggy part of the function is using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice, which causes the list index to go out of bounds for the second `pop()` call when the first `pop()` operation is removing the element at that index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that when an upstream option (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) is found in the `script_parts` list, it is removed once, and then the same index is used again in the next `pop()` call. This is incorrect as after the first `pop()` operation, the list gets shorter, and the indices change.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the index for the second `pop()` operation by accounting for the fact that the list has been modified after the first `pop()` operation.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument following '--set-upstream' or '-u'
        # Adjust the index for the second pop after the first pop operation
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle the provided test case without raising an `IndexError`.
