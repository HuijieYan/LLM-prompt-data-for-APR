### Analysis:
- The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command, as the remaining arguments should be concatenated onto the command suggested by git.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an item from the `command.script_parts` list, which suggests that the provided index is out of range.

### Potential Error Location:
- The problematic code is where it tries to remove elements using `pop` from the `command.script_parts` list based on the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.

### Explanation of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are not present in the `command.script_parts` list. In this case, the index of `upstream_option_index` remains as -1, which is an invalid index for a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to check if the index is valid before attempting to remove elements from the list.
- Additionally, the index for `-u` should be checked only if the index for `--set-upstream` is not found.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check for '--set-upstream'
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    # Check for '-u' only if '--set-upstream' was not found
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Check if the index is within range before trying to remove
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
        # Check if the index is within range before trying to remove
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the index is valid before attempting to remove elements, ensuring that an `IndexError` does not occur.
