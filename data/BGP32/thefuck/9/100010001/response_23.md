## Analysis:
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` is being raised due to `pop index out of range`.
- The buggy function attempts to find and remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag and its argument from the list of command parts, which is causing the index error.

## Error Cause:
- The buggy function tries to remove the same index twice if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags are present, leading to `pop index out of range` error.

## Fix Strategy:
- Instead of attempting two separate try-except blocks, a single check should be made to filter out both flags simultaneously.
- Handle the case where only one of the flags is present without causing the index error.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    flags_to_remove = [('--set-upstream',), ('-u',)]
    for flag in flags_to_remove:
        try:
            index = command.script_parts.index(flag[0])
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

## Output:
- The corrected function should now handle removing both flags correctly and pass the failing test without causing an index error.
