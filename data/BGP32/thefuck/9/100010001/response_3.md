### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range" at line 27, where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice.
2. The buggy function is trying to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list, but if the first option is not found, it proceeds to the second option without resetting `upstream_option_index`.
3. The bug is caused by the fact that if the first option is not found, the function proceeds to pop from an out-of-range index, as the index is not reset when the second option is searched.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure to reset the `upstream_option_index` if the first option is not found. Additionally, when removing elements from the list, we need to adjust the index based on the number of elements removed.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the updated version of the function, the bug should be fixed as it correctly handles the case where the first option is not found, prevents the out-of-range pop operation, and adjusts the index accordingly.
