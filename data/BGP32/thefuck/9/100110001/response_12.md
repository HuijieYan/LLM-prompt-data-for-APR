## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to process Git push commands. It aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the command if present, and return the modified command with the correct upstream branch information.
   
2. The error occurs at the line where it attempts to pop the `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts`. The bug arises due to the fact that the index is popped twice in the current implementation, which leads to an `IndexError` if the `-u` flag is present.
   
3. The failing test tries to assert the corrected command output for different scenarios, including the `-u` flag, against the expected values. The failing test specifically highlights the issue when the `-u` flag is included in the command.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the current implementation is due to popping the `upstream_option_index` twice in the `if` block. 
- Initially, in the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, the element at the `upstream_option_index` is removed, which shifts all elements to the left. 
- Then, immediately after that, the next line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` tries to pop the same index, which is now out of range due to the previous pop operation. This results in an `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary second pop operation from `command.script_parts`. 
- After the element at `upstream_option_index` is removed, there is no need to perform another pop operation at the same index.
- Instead, the logic should be adjusted to pop only once in the correct position.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the unnecessary second pop operation
        # No need to pop again after the element at upstream_option_index is removed.
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By removing the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line as corrected above, the bug causing the `IndexError` should be fixed. After this correction, the function should be able to process Git push commands correctly and pass the failing tests.
