### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command and its argument, then extract the suggested push command from the error message and return it with the correct 'push' argument. However, the bug occurs when trying to remove the argument that has already been removed in the previous step, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function encounters an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from `command.script_parts` that has already been removed in a previous step. This happens because the code attempts to remove the same index twice, resulting in the `pop index out of range` error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that after removing an element from `command.script_parts`, the index is checked again to correctly remove the next element without running into an `IndexError`. Another way to approach this is to find all occurrences of the arguments to be removed first and then remove them afterwards.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the function to remove the index after checking for the existence of the argument in `command.script_parts`, the bug causing the `IndexError` has been resolved. This corrected version should now be able to pass the failing test.
