## Analysis:
The buggy function fails to properly handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. It attempts to remove these options and their argument from the list, but it incorrectly pops the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when the index goes out of range.

## Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function attempts to remove the same index twice from `command.script_parts`.
2. When the `-u` option is present, it is found after the `--set-upstream` option index. Therefore, removing the `--set-upstream` index first causes a problem when trying to remove the `-u` index next because the list has been shifted.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the removal of both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and update the index accordingly to avoid popping the same index twice. We should also consider the case where only one of the options is present.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        jsondata.tmp=21
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), "push", push_upstream)
```

## Note:
Make sure to update the correct index if both options are present or if only one of them is present. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
