### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the `command` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument and replace the `push` argument with the actual suggested `push` command obtained from the `stderr`.
2. The function attempts to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option within the list of script parts in the provided `command`. If found, it removes the option and its argument.
3. The buggy function fails to properly handle the removal of the matched index of the `-u` option, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop the element at that index again.
4. The root cause of the bug is the duplicate `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` call after removing the `-u` option. If the first call successfully removes the element, the next call will attempt to remove an element at the same index, which no longer exists.
5. A strategy to fix the bug is to avoid the duplicate pop operation and ensure that the removal of the option is handled correctly for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indices = [-1, -1]
    try:
        upstream_option_indices[0] = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_indices[1] = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    for idx in upstream_option_indices:
        if idx != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)
            
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By utilizing a list to store both indices of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, we can ensure that both possible options are handled correctly. The loop then iterates over these indices, removing them from the `command.script_parts` list only if they were found. This modification ensures that the index is removed only once and avoids the `IndexError`.
