The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command, and then concatenate the remaining parts to suggest a new command for git push.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the `pop()` method call at line 27 of the buggy function. This error occurs when `command.script_parts` is being altered, leading to incorrect index access when trying to pop the same index twice.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when removing the relevant flag and its argument, we only perform `pop()` operation once for each occurrence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the flag and its argument, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
