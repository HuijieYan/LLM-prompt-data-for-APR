### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command based on the output of a git command. It tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The buggy function then extracts the upstream branch information from the stderr of the command and constructs a modified command using `replace_argument`.

The failing test cases are trying to validate the behavior of the function for different input scenarios. The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range" when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Error Cause:
1. The main issue lies in how `upstream_option_index` is handled. Even if `--set-upstream` is not found, it immediately tries to find `-u`, leading to potential redundancy and incorrect handling.
2. The use of `upstream_option_index` to remove elements from `command.script_parts` is problematic. If `-u` is used, it is reducing the length of `command.script_parts` by 2 instead of 1 due to duplicate `pop` operation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Keep track of whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` is already found to avoid redundancy.
2. After removing the option and its argument, adjust the index correctly for popping the element.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    try:
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream or -u option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now handle the input scenarios correctly and pass the failing test cases.
