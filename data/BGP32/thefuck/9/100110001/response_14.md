### Analysis:
1. The failing test is testing the `get_new_command` function with different `Command` instances related to `git push` commands.
2. The function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list if present, and then extract the `push_upstream` part from the `stderr`. Finally, it replaces the branch name in the command with the extracted `push_upstream`.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. This means that the index provided to `pop` is out of range.
4. The bug is causing the function to try to remove the same index twice, resulting in the index being out of range after the first removal. This happens when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present.
5. The fix involves removing only one element when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found instead of removing twice.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle cases where both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are provided in the command.
