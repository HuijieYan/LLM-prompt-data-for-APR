The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts`. The buggy function is designed to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their respective arguments from the script parts, then retrieve the push command suggested by git from the stderr, and finally replace the push command with the correct upstream branch. 

The error occurs when trying to remove the next item after successfully finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. This results in an `IndexError` because the index to be popped might not always exist depending on the initial condition.

To fix the bug, a check for the index range should be added before trying to pop the element. If the index is valid, the element can be safely removed. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index > 0 and upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts)-1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This modification ensures that the index being popped is within the valid range of `command.script_parts`. After making this change, the corrected function should be able to handle all scenarios correctly without throwing an `IndexError`.
