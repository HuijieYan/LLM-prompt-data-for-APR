## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process the `git push` command's output and modify it based on certain conditions.
2. The function searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command's parts list and if found, removes them along with their arguments. It then extracts the push destination from the stderr of the command and constructs a new command to be executed with the upstream branch specified.
3. The failing test attempts to check if the new command generated by `get_new_command` matches the expected output after processing various input `git push` commands.
4. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring when trying to remove an item using `pop` from the `script_parts` list of the command. The specific line causing the error is where the second `pop` operation is performed on the same index.
  
## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises due to the fact that after removing an element from the list using `pop`, the index positions of the remaining elements shift accordingly. 
- In this case, when `upstream_option_index` is found and an element is removed from `script_parts` list at that index for `--set-upstream` or `-u`, the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` causes the subsequent `pop` operation to attempt removal at the same index which has already changed after the first removal.
- This results in removing an incorrect item from the list or raising an `IndexError` for an out-of-range index access.

## Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, we need to ensure the correct items are removed from the `script_parts` list by handling the removal of elements properly post the first successful removal.
We can update the logic to remove elements corresponding to `--set-upstream` or `-u` separately and independently without relying on the same index position, ensuring the list is correctly adjusted after each removal.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the code as above, we ensure that the removal of elements associated with `--set-upstream` or `-u` is handled independently without causing index conflicts and subsequent errors.
