### Analysis:
1. The buggy function (`get_new_command`) is designed to process `git push` commands and modify them by removing unnecessary `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their respective arguments. It then parses the stdout to extract the desired command to be constructed.
   
2. The function contains a potential issue in the way it handles the removal of the upstream options. It uses `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice consecutively without any check, which can lead to an `IndexError` if the index is out of range.
   
3. The failing test asserts the transformed command produced by the `get_new_command` function with different input commands and expected outputs. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 due to popping items from the `command.script_parts` list without verifying the validity of the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we should first validate the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag before popping the items from the list. This includes checking if the index is within bounds before performing removal operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this corrected version, the `IndexError` caused by the invalid `pop()` operation should be resolved, ensuring that the function now correctly processes the input commands and produces the expected output.
