### Analysis:
The function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replace the argument `push` with the output from the `stderr` of the command.

### Error Location:
The error occurs at the line where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice, which is incorrect as it should be called only once. This results in an `IndexError` because the same array element cannot be popped twice.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index from the array command.script_parts twice in the if statement that checks if `upstream_option_index` is not -1.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should only call `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` once inside the if statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After correcting the function, it should now properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument once and replace the `push` argument with the output from the stderr.
