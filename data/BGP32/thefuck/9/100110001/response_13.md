### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to remove the specified flags `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the input command and its argument if present in the command.
2. The function then extracts the push command suggested by Git from the stderr output and uses it to replace the push command in the input command.
3. The failing test case `test_get_new_command` expects the function to correctly remove the `-u` option or `--set-upstream` option from the input command and replace the `push` command with the suggested one.
4. The bug occurs because the function is trying to remove the same index twice when the option index is found.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of `pop` to remove the found upstream option index. It tries to pop the index twice, which causes the `IndexError: pop index out of range` when the same index is used for popping again.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the code to ensure that the index is removed only once when found.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the identified index only once, resolving the `IndexError` that was causing the failing test.
