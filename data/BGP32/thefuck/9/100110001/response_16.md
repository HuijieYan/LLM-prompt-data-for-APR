### Analysis:
1. The buggy function (`get_new_command`) is attempting to modify the `command.script_parts` list by removing the index where `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found. 
2. The function then uses the error output from `command.stderr` to extract the relevant information for the new command. The bug lies in the incorrect handling of the pop operation on `command.script_parts`.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to `pop index out of range` in the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` which is repeated unnecessarily.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the pop operation is executed only once and also handle the case where the option index might not be found in the `command.script_parts` list.
5. The updated corrected version is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is still in bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `IndexError` should no longer occur, and the function should work as intended to pass the failing test.
