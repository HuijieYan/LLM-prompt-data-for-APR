The bug in the `get_new_command()` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from a list that is already empty. This occurs because the code attempts to pop an element from the index `upstream_option_index` twice (which is wrong) if the condition to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is met. 

To fix this bug, we should only pop the element once just below the condition check. The corrected version of the `get_new_command()` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the element once
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function will no longer raise an `IndexError` and should pass the failing test case.
