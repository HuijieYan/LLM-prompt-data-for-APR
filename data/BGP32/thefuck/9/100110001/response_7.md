### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to return a new git command with the correct format after parsing the stderr from a failed `git push` operation. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the input command and replace it with the recommended format from the error message.

The failing test is checking whether the corrected command matches the expected output for different variations of the input git push commands.

### Bugs:
1. The function is trying to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` twice which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` at that index the second time.
2. The function doesn't handle the case where the specified option `-u` or `--set-upstream` is missing from the input command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index twice, which results in an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the index of the specified option is not found, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting to pop the element at that index. We also need to handle the case where the specified option is not found by setting a default value for `upstream_option_index`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking if the options `--set-upstream` or `-u` are in the script parts before trying to find their index, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. Additionally, setting a default value of `-1` for `upstream_option_index` ensures that the function behaves correctly even if the option is not found.
