## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command based on the stderr output. The bug occurs when trying to remove the arguments `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command as part of processing. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `script_parts` list.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` block where the `pop` function is called twice without considering the adjustment of the index after the first pop operation. This leads to an attempt to pop an index that is out of range after the first pop.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code tries to remove the same index twice from the `script_parts` list. After the first `pop` operation, the length of the list decreases, causing the next `pop` operation using the same index to be out of range, leading to the `IndexError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the same index is not used twice for the `pop` operation. One strategy is to adjust the index after the first `pop` operation so that the second pop does not attempt to access an out-of-range index.

## Corrected Code:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Adjust the index in case it changes due to the previous pop operation
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adjusting the index of the second `pop` operation based on the length of the list after the first `pop`, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected code should now pass the failing test case.
