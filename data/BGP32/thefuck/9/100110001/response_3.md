### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and extracting the suggested upstream branch from the error message to replace in the command.
2. The potential error locations within the function are the removal of the `-u` option as well as the extraction of the push upstream branch from the error message.
3. The buggy function is throwing an `IndexError` when trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` twice from the `command.script_parts`. This error is caused because when the `--set-upstream` option is found, it is removed once, but then attempted to remove again.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that after removing the `upstream_option_index`, we skip removing it again if it was already removed.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != '-u':  # Check if the option was removed before
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying the correction, the function should no longer throw an `IndexError`, and the provided failing tests should pass successfully.
