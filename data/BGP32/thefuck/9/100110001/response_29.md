### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function expects a `Command` object as input, which contains information about the command that was executed.
2. The function attempts to extract the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command, remove them, and then extract the branch name from the stderr of the command.
3. The `get_new_command` function encounters an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an element from the `script_parts` list.
4. The failing test is trying to verify the correctness of the new command generated by the function with different input variations.

### Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. It checks for both options but does not account for the possibility that only one of them may be present. When both options are not present, the `upstream_option_index` remains -1, causing the pop operation to fail with an `IndexError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. We should only attempt to remove the option if it is found in the `script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

Applying this fix should resolve the `IndexError` encountered during the execution of the `get_new_command` function.
