### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` in `git_push.py` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command, as these options are already added by `git` when suggesting the command. The function then extracts the details of the suggested push upstream from the error message and returns a modified command.

The failing test is checking different variations of `git push` commands and expects the correct modified commands after the buggy function has processed them. The failing test is triggered by an `IndexError` during the removal of an element from `command.script_parts` using the `pop` method.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the buggy function is trying to remove elements using `pop` from `command.script_parts`. If the index of the element to be removed is the last element in the list, calling `pop` twice will result in an `IndexError`, as the list has been reduced to an empty list after the first `pop` operation.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only `pop` once for the correct index. We should also handle the case where neither `--set-upstream` nor `-u` option is present in the command.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This improvement ensures that we only remove the element once if found and handles the case when neither option is present in the command. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
