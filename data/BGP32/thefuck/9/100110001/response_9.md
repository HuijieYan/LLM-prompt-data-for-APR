### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input command script, assuming that it always occurs before the actual push operation.
2. The buggy function then extracts the push operation suggestion from the stderr of the command output and replaces the previous push command with the extracted suggestion.
3. The failing test is attempting to verify the behavior for different variation of the input command, based on stderr output.
4. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which occurs when trying to pop from an empty list.

### Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument (`command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`), it attempts to remove the same index again, which results in an `IndexError` when the list is empty.

### Fix:
To address this bug, we should only remove the specified index once and then adjust the subsequent indexes accordingly. Updating the logic to check if the index exists before attempting to remove it will prevent the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By applying this fix, the function will handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option correctly and avoid causing an `IndexError` when attempting to pop from an empty list.
