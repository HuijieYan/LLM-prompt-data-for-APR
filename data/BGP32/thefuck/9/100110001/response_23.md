### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to process a command to remove specific arguments (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) and then extract relevant information from the `stderr` to construct a new command. However, there are several issues:
1. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument is flawed and may lead to errors.
2. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `stderr` is incorrect, as it relies on a fixed position in the split string.
3. The `IndexError` is raised when trying to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument.
2. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` by using a more robust method instead of relying on the position in the split string.
3. Fix the IndexError by checking if the index is valid before calling `pop` twice.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command arguments
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the command

    # Extract the push_upstream value from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ""
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('git push') and 'set-upstream' not in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().replace('git push', '')

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the logic in the `get_new_command` function as shown above, the function should now accurately extract the necessary information from the input `command` and construct the new command as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
