### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `get_new_command`, is designed to modify the git push command based on the stderr output. It first tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the command script parts and then removes them from the command parts list if found. 
2. The buggy function then extracts the push upstream information from the stderr and uses it to replace the push argument in the command parts list.
3. The failing test case is focused on testing the behavior of the function when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurred due to popping the same index from the command parts list.

### Error Cause:
The bug is caused by popping the same index from the `command.script_parts` list twice when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the script. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop from an index that no longer exists in the list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing the upstream option indexes. We should only remove the found index once to ensure that we do not try to pop from a non-existent index in the list. Additionally, we should handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` might be present in the command separately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the code will properly handle multiple occurrences of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the command script parts and avoid the `IndexError` by popping the found index only once.
