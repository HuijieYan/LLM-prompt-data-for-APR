### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command based on the output of the `git push` command.
2. The function searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the input command and removes it along with its argument if found.
3. The function then extracts the `push_upstream` part from the stderr output to construct a new command.
4. The error occurs when trying to pop an element from a list using an invalid index, causing an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is due to a logical error in the handling of the upstream option index. When both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, the function mistakenly attempts to remove the same index twice.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only one removal of the upstream option index is done. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the upstream option index is not found in the command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of either '--set-upstream' or '-u' option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # Extract the push_upstream part from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should handle both cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present and construct the new command without causing an `IndexError`.
