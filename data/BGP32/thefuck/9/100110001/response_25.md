### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the element twice from `command.script_parts` if the `-u` flag was found in the command script parts. This error occurs because the index is being used twice in a row without checking the list length.
2. The failing test is checking multiple scenarios where the `get_new_command` function should modify the command to include `--set-upstream origin master` irrespective of the initial command passed.
3. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurs while popping an element from the list which is out of range.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that after successfully finding the index of the option `-u`, we only pop the element once from the list.
5. The corrected version of the function should include this fix.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # The remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By ensuring that we only pop the element once from the list when `-u` flag is found, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
