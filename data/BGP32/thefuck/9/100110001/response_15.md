### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument and replacing the argument `push` with the suggested value from the error message.
2. The buggy function has an issue where it is trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`, which is causing an `IndexError` when the flag `-u` is present in the command.
3. The failing test is checking the output of the function for different variations of the `git push` command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by popping the same index twice in the script.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the upstream option index is found, the script part is popped only once to remove the flag and its argument.
5. The corrected version of the function will handle the indexing properly to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the index pop operation properly if the upstream option is found, avoiding the `IndexError`. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
