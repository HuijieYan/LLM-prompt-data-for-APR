## Analysis:
- The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, getting the push command suggested by git from the stderr, and replacing the target branch with the correct branch name.
- The issue occurs when trying to remove the same index from `command.script_parts` twice after detecting the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. This causes an IndexError when trying to pop an index that is out of range.

## Bug:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from an IndexError caused by trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the index once if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the command.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument correctly without causing an IndexError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
