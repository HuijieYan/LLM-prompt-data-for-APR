### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, as well as extracting the remote and branch name from the stdout of the `git push` command.
   
2. The failing test provides different variations of `git push` commands and expects the modified output after the function is applied.
   
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` beyond its indexes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because after checking for the index of `--set-upstream`, if the index for `-u` is also found, the second pop operation is performed without considering that the list has already been modified by the first pop.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list only once, regardless of whether `-u` or `--set-upstream` is found. Additionally, we need to handle scenarios where these options are not present in the command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Check once for both options then proceed
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and avoids the IndexError by removing the elements only once based on the conditional checks.
