### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and then extract the target branch from the error message. However, the implementation to remove these options from the command is problematic.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`. The issue is that when we use `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, it removes an element at `upstream_option_index` from the list and shifts the remaining elements. So, the subsequent `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` tries to remove an element that no longer exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug leads to an `IndexError` because the same element is being popped twice consecutively. This behavior leads to the second `pop` operation trying to access an index that has shifted due to the first pop, eventually resulting in an out-of-range index error.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` only once by updating one of the pop operations not to be repeated. Additionally, we should handle the case when the `.index()` method does not find the specified option.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, including --set-upstream and its argument

    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function should now handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly and pass the failing test cases without raising an `IndexError`.
