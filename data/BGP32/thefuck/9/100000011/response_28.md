### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, concatenating the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git.

### Error Locations:
1. The code to check for either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not correctly implemented. The second try block for `-u` will always execute, overriding the value of `upstream_option_index` from the first try block.
2. Removing the option and its argument from `command.script_parts` is incorrect since both are removed twice.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing incorrect behavior for the `git push` command when options such as `--set-upstream` or `-u` are used. The function currently does not handle the removal of these options correctly, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and store their respective indices in separate variables.
2. Remove the option and its argument only once from `command.script_parts`.
3. Use the correct index to remove the option and argument from `command.script_parts`.
4. Address the incorrect splitting logic in identifying the suggested push upstream.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for --set-upstream or -u
    upstream_option_index_set = -1
    upstream_option_index_u = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index_set = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Determine the correct index for removal
    upstream_option_index = max(upstream_option_index_set, upstream_option_index_u)

    # Remove the option and its argument once
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Fix the logic for extracting the suggested push upstream
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to checking for options, removing them once correctly, and fixing the extraction of the suggested push upstream.
