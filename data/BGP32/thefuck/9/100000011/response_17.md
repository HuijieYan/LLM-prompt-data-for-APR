## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `get_new_command` is related to the GitHub issue #538. The issue involves a bug that occurred after a specific change (#538) was merged. The issue specifically mentions that suggestions for `git push -u myfork` were broken after the merge of #538.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The code attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command.
2. The extraction of the `push_upstream` string from the command's stderr might not be accurate.
3. The replacement of the `push` argument in the command may not be functioning correctly.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in this function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the `git push` command. The removal of these flags might not be done accurately, leading to unexpected behavior in the generated new command. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` string from the stderr and the subsequent replacement might not be reliable, resulting in incorrect suggestions.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Fix the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in a way that ensures accurate removal.
2. Verify and improve the extraction of the `push_upstream` string from the stderr to capture the intended value.
3. Ensure the replacement of the `push` argument in the command is done correctly.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
from thefuck.shells import shell

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    skip_indices = []
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            skip_indices.append(command.script_parts.index(opt))
        except ValueError:
            pass

    script_parts = [part for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if idx not in skip_indices]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[0]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
- I have modified the logic to accurately remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags by storing the indices to skip.
- Improved the extraction of `push_upstream` string from stderr.
- Used the modified `script_parts` list for generating the new command.

This correction should resolve the issue mentioned in GitHub related to the broken suggestions for `git push -u myfork`.
