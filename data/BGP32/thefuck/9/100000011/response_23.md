### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle suggestions for the `git push` command. In this case, the function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `script_parts` if present. The bug here seems to be related to how the function tries to find and remove these options.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `upstream_option_index` initialization.
2. Removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `script_parts`.
3. Extraction of `push_upstream` from `stderr`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the way the function is searching for and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The function doesn't handle the index removal correctly, leading to incorrect suggestions in scenarios where the option is present.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and then remove them from `script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` should be handled properly to ensure the correct formatting of the new command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function now correctly identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. It also extracts `push_upstream` properly from `stderr` and formats the new command accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to suggestions for `git push -u myfork`.
