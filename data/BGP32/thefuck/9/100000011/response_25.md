### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is responsible for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command given to it. However, the bug is that it doesn't properly handle the case where both options are present in the command. It simply removes the first occurrence and doesn't consider the scenario where both options can be present.

The GitHub issue describes that the suggested command should be `git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp` instead of `hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier` due to a bug introduced in issue #538.

### Error Location:
The error is in the if block where it removes `upstream_option_index` twice without validating if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are present in the command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to assuming that only one of the options `-u` or `--set-upstream` will be present in the command. When both are present, the function incorrectly removes the first occurrence multiple times.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of removing the option and its argument inside the same if block, we can first identify both `-u` and `--set-upstream` indices separately.
2. Then remove these indices separately without impacting the other option.
3. Add a check to validate if both indices are not the same, so that both options are removed properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indices = []
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    except ValueError:
        pass

    upstream_option_indices.sort()  # Sort indices to handle multiple occurrences correctly

    if len(upstream_option_indices) == 2:
        command.script_parts.pop(min(upstream_option_indices))
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_indices[0])  # Adjust index for removal

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the scenario where both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options are present in the command correctly, removing both of them to generate the desired command output.
