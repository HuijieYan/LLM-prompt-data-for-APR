### Analysis:
The buggy function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding argument from the `git push` command. However, the function contains a logic error in handling the removal of these options. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that after a specific change (#538), the suggestions for `git push -u` are incorrect.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of multiple attempts to find `--set-upstream` or `-u` index.
2. Incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from `command.script_parts`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect indexing and removal of arguments in the `command.script_parts` list. The function does not properly handle the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding argument if present in the `command.script_parts` list. It is essential to handle multiple occurrences of either flag correctly and ensure that the script parts are manipulated accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Handle the case when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' may be present
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            # If the argument follows the option, remove that as well
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Introduced a list `upstream_options` to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Utilized a loop to iterate over both options and remove them with their arguments if present.
3. Updated the logic to ensure correct removal of options and arguments from `command.script_parts`. 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
