## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument, then constructing a new command by replacing the argument of the `push` command. However, the bug lies in the logic where the `upstream_option_index` is used to identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value seems incorrect and might lead to incorrect suggestions.

## Identified issues:
1. The assignment of `upstream_option_index` to `-1` before checking for the options is unnecessary.
2. The `upstream_option_index` is potentially overwritten without considering the conditions.
3. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` might not always work as expected.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug may be causing incorrect suggestions because of incorrect logic for handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and extracting `push_upstream` from the `stderr`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
2. Refactor the extraction of `push_upstream` to ensure it retrieves the correct value for concatenation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stdout.partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Use a copy of `command.script_parts` to avoid directly modifying it.
2. Correctly check and handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
3. Extract `push_upstream` from the `stdout` instead of `stderr` and adjust the split logic for correctness.
