### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to correct the suggestion for the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing the argument related to pushing with the correct format. The bug seems to be that the function incorrectly identifies the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and does not handle it properly.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the following:
1. Incorrect usage of `is not` in the condition for checking `upstream_option_index`.
2. The removal of the elements at `upstream_option_index` should be `pop(upstream_option_index)` and `pop(upstream_option_index)`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the index when identifying the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command. The indices are not properly being removed from the `command.script_parts`, leading to an incorrect final output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command parts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the --set-upstream or -u and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    # Extract the push target from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command parts and should provide the correct suggestion for the `git push` command as intended.
