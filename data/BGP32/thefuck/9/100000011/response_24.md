### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument from the command provided, as the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes the `--set-upstream` and its argument. However, the bug is causing incorrect removal of these options and resulting in the wrong output.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is not being updated correctly when checking for the presence of `-u`.
2. The lines `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` are popping elements at the same index, which might not be correct as there could be only one element to remove.
3. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` seems incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable, which is not updated properly when checking for `-u`. Additionally, popping elements at the same index might result in unexpected behavior. The extraction of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` might not be fetching the correct value.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `upstream_option_index` variable correctly when checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Handle the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` list carefully.
3. Ensure the correct extraction of `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there is an argument to remove
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function now correctly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments. It also ensures the correct extraction of `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`, which was previously causing issues.
