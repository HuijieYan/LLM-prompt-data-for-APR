### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is responsible for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, then getting the suggested command to replace the original one provided by Git. The issue on GitHub (#538) points out that the suggestions for `git push -u origin` are incorrect after the changes made in response to issue #538.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not correct.
2. The extraction of the suggested command from the error message is not handling the correct position.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of arguments related to setting the upstream when the command is `git push -u origin`. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested command from the error message assumes a fixed position in the error message, leading to inaccuracies.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command.
2. Refactor the extraction of the suggested command from the error message to capture the correct position dynamically.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version:
1. The code now correctly removes both the option (e.g., `--set-upstream` or `-u`) and its argument from the command.
2. The extraction of the suggested command from the error message now considers the correct position by adjusting the line where the suggestion is located in the error message.

By making these adjustments, the function should now provide accurate suggestions for `git push -u origin` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
