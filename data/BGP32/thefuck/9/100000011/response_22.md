### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case when the user runs `git push -u origin` or `git push --set-upstream origin` and suggest a corrected command based on the error message generated by Git. The function tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument from the command, as they are already included in the suggestion provided by Git. Then, it extracts the suggested command from the error message and replaces the 'push' argument with that suggestion.

### Issues:
1. The error handling for finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the `command.script_parts` list is incorrect. If the first option is found, it will be overwritten by the second option.
2. The indexing of the option elements to pop them from the `command.script_parts` list is incorrect.
3. `push_upstream` extraction logic from `command.stderr` is based on the assumption of the error message structure, which may not always be reliable.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function doesn't handle the case when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present in the command correctly. Additionally, the assumption about the structure of the error message might lead to incorrect extraction of the suggested command.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Update the error handling to correctly identify both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the command and handle them separately.
2. Properly pop the identified options from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. Improve the method of extracting the push suggestion from the error message.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from script_parts
    upstream_option_indexes = [index for index, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indexes):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    # Extract suggested push command from stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if line.startswith('To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return None  # If suggestion extraction fails
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u', removes them correctly from the command, and extracts the push suggestion from the error message based on the specific error structure.
