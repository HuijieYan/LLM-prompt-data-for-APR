### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the situation where a user tries to push changes to a branch using `git push -u` with a specific upstream branch. The function is intended to extract the upstream branch name from the error message and construct a corrected command to push changes. The bug seems to be related to the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the command before constructing the new command.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is not handled correctly, leading to incorrect slicing of the script parts.
2. The index where the `upstream_option_index` is stored might not be updated correctly if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options are present.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. Since the removal of these options is not handled properly, it affects the construction of the new command. This issue has been reported in GitHub issue #538, where a user noticed incorrect suggestions being made by the function after an update.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct indices of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are identified and removed from the command. Additionally, we should handle the case when both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options are present to prevent any index out of range errors.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Checking if next element exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version incorporates a check to ensure that the next element to be removed actually exists. It also ensures that the correct indices are updated and the command is constructed accurately. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and provide correct suggestions for `git push -u` commands.
