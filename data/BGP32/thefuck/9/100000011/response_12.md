### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle suggestions for the `git push` command when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag is passed. However, the bug causes incorrect behavior as reported in the GitHub issues #538 and #558. The function attempts to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument and its value from the command. Still, the logic is flawed and leads to potential index errors and incorrect suggestion generation.

### Error Locations:
1. The function populates the `upstream_option_index` with the index of the `--set-upstream` flag and then overwrites it with the index of the `-u` flag without considering both scenarios simultaneously. This results in only the last flag index being stored, potentially causing issues.
2. The handling of populating the `push_upstream` variable from the command's stderr might not be robust and could lead to errors if the output format changes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incomplete logic for identifying and removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag and its value from the command. This incomplete logic fails to provide the correct indexes, leading to issues in generating the new command for the suggestion. The flawed `push_upstream` extraction from stderr can also contribute to incorrect outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the code logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flag scenario simultaneously and store both indexes.
2. Improve error handling while extracting `push_upstream` to ensure robust behavior.
3. Consider the input variations and edge cases for proper suggestion formation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = []
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_indexes.append(command.script_parts.index(flag))
        except ValueError:
            pass

    for index in upstream_option_indexes:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)

    # Extract the push_upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = ""
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].split(' ')[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are considered simultaneously for identification and removal.
- The extraction of `push_upstream` is improved to handle cases where the stderr format might vary.
- The function should now generate correct suggestions for `git push -u` scenarios, addressing the reported GitHub issues.
