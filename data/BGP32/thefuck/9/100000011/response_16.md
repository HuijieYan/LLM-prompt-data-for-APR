### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file is intended to generate a corrected git push command by removing unnecessary arguments like `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the user's input command. However, the bug is causing incorrect output when generating the new command.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` and `-u` arguments is not implemented correctly.
2. The index removal is done incorrectly, leading to a shift in the elements of the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The extraction of the push upstream command from `command.stderr` is relying on a specific position, which may vary based on the output format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is primarily caused by the incorrect use of the index after finding the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument. Due to the incorrect removal of these arguments, the extraction of the push upstream command may not be accurate, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the script parts list.
2. Extract the push upstream command by parsing the `command.stderr` in a more reliable way, rather than relying on a fixed position.
3. Ensure that the corrected version of the command is properly generated without unnecessary arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract push upstream command from stderr
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        line = line.strip()
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By implementing these changes, the function should correctly handle the removal of unnecessary arguments and generate the new command suggestion accurately, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
