### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to handle git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options if present. However, the bug is related to incorrect removal of these options from the command. This leads to incorrect suggestions when the command is executed, as described in the GitHub issue.


### Error Location:
The error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
2. Incorrectly selecting the index to pop while removing the options.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing incorrect suggestions because the function does not properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the git push command. This results in the wrong command being suggested to the user when `fuck` is invoked.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the indexing when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. We should ensure that only the correct index is popped when removing these options, and the rest of the command remains intact.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and provide the user with the accurate suggestion for the git push command.
