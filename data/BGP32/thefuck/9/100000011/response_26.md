### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the git command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their respective arguments from the script parts. It then extracts the push upstream suggestion by grabbing the third line from the `stderr` output and removes 'git' from it. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of the arguments and the extracted push upstream suggestion.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `upstream_option_index` to remove `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments from `script_parts`.
2. Extraction of `push_upstream` from the`stderr` output split.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`. This leads to incorrect indexing of elements in the `script_parts` list, impacting the correct generation of the new command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options with their arguments.
2. Validate the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `stderr` output to ensure correct partitioning. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their arguments from script_parts
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command_parts.index(option)
            command_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove option
            command_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove argument of the option
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract push upstream suggestion correctly
    push_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = push_parts[-3].strip().replace('git ', '')  # Extract and remove 'git '
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options with their arguments and correctly extracts the push upstream suggestion from the `stderr` output. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
