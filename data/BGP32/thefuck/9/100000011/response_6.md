## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command()` is supposed to fix suggestions for `git push -u origin`, where it removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument before concatenating the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `script_parts.index()` is not handling multiple occurrences of the flags.
2. Incorrect handling of popping elements from `command.script_parts`.
3. Misinterpretation of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of flags `-u` or `--set-upstream`. The function is not properly handling multiple occurrences of the flags in the command, which results in incorrect suggestions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a loop to handle all occurrences of both `-u` and `--set-upstream`.
2. Update the logic for removing elements from `command.script_parts`.
3. Correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` using the proper method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[1:]
    push_upstream = ' '.join(push_upstream_parts)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now appropriately handle multiple occurrences of flags `-u` and `--set-upstream`, extract the correct `push_upstream` value, and generate the correct suggestion for `git push -u <argument>`.
