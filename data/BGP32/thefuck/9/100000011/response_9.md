### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the git push command suggestion by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the suggested command. However, the bug occurs when trying to remove the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The script tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument but may not handle the index correctly if both flags are present.
2. The extraction of the pushed upstream command from `command.stderr` may not always work as expected.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the pushed upstream command from `command.stderr` might not always provide the correct output due to potential variations in error messages.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more reliable method to extract the pushed upstream command from a Git error message.
2. Adjust the logic for handling the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument to ensure correct index manipulation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()  # Adjusted to get correct pushed upstream command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to improve the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument removal, along with a more reliable way to extract the pushed upstream command from the error message.
