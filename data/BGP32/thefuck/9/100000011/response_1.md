### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The buggy function is designed to handle the suggestions for the `git push` command, specifically when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is passed. The issue mentioned in the GitHub is about fixing suggestions for `git push -u origin`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The attempt to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options using `index()` may not work as expected.
2. The manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list might not be accurate.

### Cause of the bug using the buggy function and GitHub issue information:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the command parts in the `command.script_parts` list. The incorrect removal of the upstream option and its argument leads to incorrect suggestions when using `git push -u`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly identify and remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option along with its argument from the command.
2. Ensure the correct extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr output.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Initialize push_upstream variable to None
    push_upstream = None

    # Remove '--set-upstream' and '-u' options along with their arguments
    for opt in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
        if opt in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
            if index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract push upstream command from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    if push_upstream:
        new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
        return new_command
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by correctly removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their arguments. It also ensures the accurate extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr output.
