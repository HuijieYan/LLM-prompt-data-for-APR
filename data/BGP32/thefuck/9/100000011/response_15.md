## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle the case of correcting the suggested command when using `git push -u origin`, removing the `-u` flag from the suggested command. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that prevent it from working correctly.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The check for `-u` flag removal is performing multiple `try-except` blocks, which may not correctly identify the index of the flag.
2. The removal of the `-u` flag is incorrect as two elements are popped from the `script_parts`.
3. The extraction of the suggested command from `command.stderr` is taking the incorrect index.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly removing the `-u` flag from the suggested `git push` command. This results in an incorrect command being suggested to the user when they try to use `git push -u origin` command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly identify the index of the `-u` flag in the command script parts.
2. Remove only one element from the script parts when removing the `-u` flag.
3. Extract the correct suggested `git push` command from the `command.stderr`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    # Remove the '-u' flag if it exists
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
    
    # Extract the suggested git push command correctly
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, the `-u` flag removal is fixed to remove only one element from the script parts. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested `git push` command is corrected to get the correct index from the `stderr`. This should resolve the issue with incorrect suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
