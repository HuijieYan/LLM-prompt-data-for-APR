### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments from the list of script parts in the command. The function then extracts the suggested git command output from the stderr and replaces the `push` argument with the extracted upstream branch.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options might not work correctly.
2. The extraction of the suggested git command might not handle different formats of stderr output.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options due to not handling multiple occurrences of these options properly. This leads to extracting the suggested command incorrectly from `stderr`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options independently to ensure proper removal.
2. Implement a robust method to extract the suggested command from `stderr` that handles variations in the output format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if option_index != -1:
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    suggested_command = ''
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'git push' in line:
            suggested_command = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', suggested_command)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now iterates over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options independently to remove them properly.
- It parses the `stderr` looking for 'git push' to extract the suggested command more robustly.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide accurate suggestions for the `git push -u` command.
