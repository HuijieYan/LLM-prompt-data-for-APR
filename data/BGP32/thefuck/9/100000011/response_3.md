### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to extract the push command from the stderr of the `git push` command and suggest it as the corrected command. However, the function has a bug in handling the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The bug causes the function to remove the wrong arguments from the command, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Identified potential errors:
1. The logic to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is incorrect.
2. Incorrect usage of `pop` to remove the elements at the identified index.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command arguments list. Subsequently, when trying to remove the identified index using `pop`, it removes the wrong arguments from the command, leading to an incorrect suggestion.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command arguments list and then remove only that particular argument and its corresponding value, rather than removing the identified index twice. We also need to handle the case where the required option might not be present in the command arguments list.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    up_option = '--set-upstream'
    short_up_option = '-u'
    
    if up_option in command.script_parts:
        up_option_index = command.script_parts.index(up_option)
    elif short_up_option in command.script_parts:
        up_option_index = command.script_parts.index(short_up_option)
    else:
        up_option_index = -1

    if up_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(up_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(up_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, I have updated the logic to correctly identify the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list. If the option is found, I remove only that specific argument and its value by adjusting the index positions accordingly. This will ensure that the correct arguments are removed and the suggestion is accurate based on the `git push` command output.
