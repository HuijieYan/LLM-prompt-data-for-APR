The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option while trying to remove it from the command arguments. The function currently only removes one occurrence of the option and its argument, but in the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command, it fails to remove both.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is incorrect and needs to be adjusted to capture the correct string.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove all occurrences of --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments
    script_parts = list(command.script_parts)
    script_parts = [part for i, part in enumerate(script_parts) if i not in {i, i+1} for i in {i for i, v in enumerate(script_parts) if v in ['--set-upstream', '-u'}]
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command arguments, leading to the correct output and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub reports.
