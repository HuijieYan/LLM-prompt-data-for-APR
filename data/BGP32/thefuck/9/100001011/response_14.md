### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to modify the `push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing it with the correct `push` command. However, there are issues with how it handles the removal of these options and calculates the correct `push_upstream` value. The function is not correctly identifying and removing the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function arises from the way it handles checking and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. The function tries to remove the option and its argument but does not account for the correct position of these elements. This results in incorrect modification of the `push` command and subsequently incorrect suggestions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately identify the position of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument in the `command.script_parts` list. Once identified, we can correctly remove these elements and generate the correct `push_upstream` value for the replacement. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for --set-upstream or -u option and remove if found
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the correct push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function iterates through both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, correctly identifies their positions in the `command.script_parts` list, removes them with their corresponding arguments, and then generates the correct `push_upstream` value for the replacement.
