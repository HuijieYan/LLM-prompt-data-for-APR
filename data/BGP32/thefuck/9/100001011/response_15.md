### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands and remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument before suggesting a correction for the command. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the removal of these flags and their arguments.

### Error Location
The error is occurring when trying to remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Also, the extraction of the push_upstream value from the stderr output seems incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug appears to stem from how the code handles the removal of the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument. If the -u flag is found, it's trying to remove it twice, leading to an incorrect manipulation of the script_parts list. Additionally, the extraction of the push_upstream value is not correctly partitioning the git command from the stderr output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the function removes the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the push_upstream value needs to be adjusted to accurately capture the git command suggested in the stderr output.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if flag in command.script_parts:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove the flag
            # Check if the flag has an argument
            if flag_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will properly handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument and extract the git command from the stderr output to suggest the correct command for git push.
