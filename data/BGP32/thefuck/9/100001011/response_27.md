### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to process a git push command and modify it by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present and suggesting a correct git push command based on the error message. The bug seems to be related to how the function identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag.

### Bug Identification
The bug in the function lies in how it handles removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag. The function currently removes the flag and its argument using the same index. However, if the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command, the function may skip removing one of them incorrectly. This leads to an incorrect command suggestion.

### Bug Cause
- In the provided case, the `upstream_option_index` is set to `-1` initially.
- When trying to find the index of `--set-upstream`, it would fail due to the flag only being `-u`. Thus, it goes into the second `try` block to find the index of `-u`.
- If both flags are present in the command, only the last found flag will be removed since both `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` are using the same index.
- The incorrect removal of the flag leads to an incorrect push command in the return statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Separate the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags.
- Use the correct indexes for removing the flag and its argument.
- Ensure that both flags are properly handled in case they appear together.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Remove the flag and its argument separately
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
        # Check if the flag has an argument to remove
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By separating the removal of the flag and its argument, the corrected function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly and provide the accurate git push command suggestion.
