### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags if present in the command script parts. Then, it extracts the suggested push command from the stderr and replaces the push command with it. However, the bug occurs due to how it handles the removal of the flags in the `script_parts` list.

### Error Location:
The error is located in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable and the removal of the flag arguments from the `script_parts` list.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The code incorrectly removes the flags from the `script_parts` list causing issues with the subsequent index access.
2. The command.stderr extraction doesn't handle cases where there is no suggested push command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper removal of the flag arguments from the `script_parts` list without causing index out of range errors.
2. Implement a check for cases where the command.stderr might not contain the suggested push command to avoid errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_split = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_split) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_split[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return None
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of removing flag arguments and safely extracting the suggested push command from the stderr. It also includes a check for cases where the stderr might not contain the expected information.
