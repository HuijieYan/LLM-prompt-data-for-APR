### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument, then suggest a corrected version by replacing the `push` command with the correct upstream branch. The issue seems to be related to handling the upstream branch suggestion correctly.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the function is that it tries to find the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately but does not handle the case where both flags might be present. Additionally, it incorrectly calculates the `push_upstream` value, causing the incorrect return value.

### Bug Cause
1. If both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present, the function does not handle removing both correctly.
2. The parsing of the `push_upstream` value is incorrect, causing an incorrect suggestion.

### Proposed Fix
1. Update the code to check if both flags are present and handle the removal of both cases properly.
2. Correctly parse the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` to suggest the correct upstream branch.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # Find the indices of both flags, if present
    upstream_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u']
    # Remove both flags and their arguments if found
    for idx in reversed(upstream_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        if idx < len(command.script_parts):  # remove the argument as well
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)

    # Get the correct upstream branch
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code now properly handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments. It also parses the correct upstream branch, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
