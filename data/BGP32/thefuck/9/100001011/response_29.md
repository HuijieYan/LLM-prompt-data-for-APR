### Fixing the bug
The buggy function is not correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the input command. The issue stems from how the function calculates the `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent removal of the elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the assignment of `push_upstream` is incorrect.

#### Cause of the bug:
1. The function always sets `upstream_option_index` to either `-1`, the index where `--set-upstream` is found, or the index where `-u` is found. This can lead to incorrect removal of elements from `command.script_parts`.
2. The calculation of `push_upstream` is incorrect as it assumes a fixed format for the command's stderr output.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of using two separate try-except blocks to find the indices of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, use a single conditional statement to identify either of the options.
2. Update the logic to extract the correct `push_upstream` value from the stderr output of the command.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the command
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)

    # Extract the upstream branch from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().split()[-1]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the input command and extract the appropriate upstream branch from the stderr for generating the new command.
