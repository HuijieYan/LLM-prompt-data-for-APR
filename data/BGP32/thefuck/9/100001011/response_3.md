### Analyzing the buggy function
The `get_new_command` function is supposed to modify a given git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments and replacing the `push` command with the upstream branch. However, the implementation seems to have a bug as it is not handling the removal of `-u` correctly based on the provided runtime information.

### Potential error locations
1. The logic for handling the removal of the `-u` option may not be properly implemented.
2. Handling of the index for `-u` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug
Based on the runtime values and the expected outcome, the function fails to correctly identify the index of the `-u` option in the `command.script_parts`. As a result, the subsequent removal logic targeting the index is not functioning as intended. This leads to incorrect output where the `-u` option along with its argument is not properly handled, resulting in a flawed new command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the correct index of the `-u` option is identified in `command.script_parts`.
2. Adjust the removal logic to correctly handle the `-u` option and its argument.
3. Verify that the replacement of the `push` command with the upstream branch is working as expected.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there's an argument after '-u'
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation
- Added a check to ensure that the upstream option index is valid before trying to pop the corresponding argument.
- Adjusted the condition for checking the `upstream_option_index` to make sure the removal of the argument after `-u` is done correctly.
- This corrected version should now handle the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments while replacing the `push` command with the upstream branch as intended.
