### Explanation:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument in the git push command. The function is trying to remove these arguments from the command but is not doing it correctly, leading to the incorrect output.

In the given runtime example, the `command.script_parts` contains `['git', 'push']`, and the `push_upstream` value is `'push --set-upstream origin master'`. This indicates that the function is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` argument from the command.

The bug is related to how the function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command, and the incorrect handling is leading to the wrong output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command before constructing the new command. We should also ensure correct indexing and removal of the argument from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            break

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over `command.script_parts` to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument correctly. We then proceed to extract `push_upstream` for constructing the new command. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
