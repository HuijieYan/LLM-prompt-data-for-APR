### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list and then extract the suggested git push command from `command.stderr` to be used in creating a new command.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that it incorrectly extracts the suggested git push command from `command.stderr`. Instead of extracting only the command, it also includes the `--set-upstream` part in the extracted value, leading to incorrect suggestions.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the incorrect extraction of the push command from `command.stderr`.
2. Update the extraction logic to only consider the correct part of the stderr that contains the suggested git push command.
3. Make sure to handle cases where the branch name contains spaces by extracting the correct part of the stderr considering this possibility.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested git push command correctly
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ""
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'git push' in line:  # Find the line that contains the suggested push command
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git push ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should accurately extract the suggested git push command and provide the correct output when resolving the issue described in the GitHub posts.
