### Analysis
The buggy function aims to process a git push command by extracting the suggested push command from the stderr output and replacing the 'push' argument with that suggestion. However, the bug occurs when the function tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command script parts as it does not handle the case where both are present simultaneously.

### Error Location
The error lies in the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command script parts.

### Bug Cause
In the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the command script parts, the function incorrectly removes the same index twice, causing an error in the subsequent logic to extract the push suggestion from the stderr.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present correctly. Instead of blindly popping the same index twice, we should ensure that if the second check for '-u' is executed, it should not remove the same index again.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts and '-u' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        else:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version handles the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present correctly, ensuring that the index removal is done only once and addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
