The buggy function is designed to modify a git command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument and then replacing the 'push' command with the retrieved command from the stderr of the input `command`. The bug seems to be in the logic that removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument from the git command.

The issue arises when the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of '-u' in the `command.script_parts`, and then it is immediately overwritten if '--set-upstream' is also present in the `command.script_parts`. The bug causes the function to remove only one occurrence of the flag and its argument, leading to incorrect command modification.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags along with their arguments are removed from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we should consider the case where either of those flags is not present in the `command.script_parts` by using `if` condition instead of `try-except`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove both occurrences of it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly remove both occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`, ensuring that the modified command is correct and consistent with the expected behavior.
