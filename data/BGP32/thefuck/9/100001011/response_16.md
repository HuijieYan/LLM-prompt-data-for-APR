### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, the GitHub issue
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to process a git push command and adjust its arguments based on certain conditions. It extracts the branch names and other details from the given command and reassembles it into a corrected form. The GitHub issues indicate that there are problems with suggested corrections after recent changes (#538) were merged.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The logic for handling `--set-upstream` or `-u` options might not be correctly removing them from the command.
2. There might be an issue with extracting the push_upstream value from the command's stderr.

### Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the runtime input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information
The bug arises when trying to adjust the git push command with `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The incorrect removal of these options and the erroneous extraction of push_upstream values lead to incorrect suggestions for the command, as evidenced by the GitHub issue reports.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are properly removed without causing index out of range errors.
2. Validate the extraction of push_upstream from the command's stderr to determine if it is correctly capturing the branch names.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the issues with removing the options and correctly extracting the push_upstream value, leading to accurate suggestions for the git push command.
