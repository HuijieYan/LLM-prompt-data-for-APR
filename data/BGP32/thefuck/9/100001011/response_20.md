### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command to fix suggestions for `git push`.
2. The function identifies the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and attempts to remove them from the `command.script_parts`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the removal of the correct index of the flag and its argument, leading to incorrect output.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the section where the function is trying to remove the identified indices of the flag and its argument from `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Cause:
The current logic of removing both the flag and its argument is incorrect. It should only remove the flag and keep the argument to form the corrected command.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the logic to remove only the identified flag and keep its argument in the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the branch name from the error message
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```

With this corrected version, the function will iterate over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, removing the correct flag and keeping its argument in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it extracts the branch name from the error message to formulate the corrected command.
