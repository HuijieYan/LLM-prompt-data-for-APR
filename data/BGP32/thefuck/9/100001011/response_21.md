### Analyzing the buggy function and the runtime values:

- The buggy function is supposed to modify the git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument.
- The runtime values show that the input command is 'git push' and the stderr contains a message indicating the correct way to push the current branch.
- The variable upstream_option_index is initialized with -1 and updated based on the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.
- The push_upstream variable seems to extract the correct information from the stderr message.

### Identifying the bug:

- The bug lies in the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument from the command.
- The current code is popping the same index twice, which will not remove the flag and its argument correctly.

### Bug cause:

- The bug causes the incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument, leading to an incorrect new command being generated.

### Fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument by removing them once. Here is the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if len(command.script_parts) > index:
                command.script_parts.pop(index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrects the issue by iterating over both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and removing them correctly from the command, fixing the bug related to generating the new push command.
