### Issue:
Based on the provided information from the GitHub issues and the runtime values of the variables, the bug in the `get_new_command` function arises when trying to handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is included in the user's command. The bug results in an incorrect output command after parsing the input.

### Potential Error Location:
The main issue seems to stem from how the `upstream_option_index` is being handled when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command script parts. Additionally, the slicing operation on `command.stderr` might not always provide the correct output due to inconsistency in the length of the split lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the script parts of the command. When both flags are present, the removal process is not handled correctly, resulting in an incorrect final command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are handled correctly, and their respective arguments are removed properly.
2. Use a more reliable method to extract the command suggested by git from the `command.stderr` without relying on specific line indexes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument if present
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    updated_parts = []
    skip_next = False
    for part in command_parts:
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            skip_next = True
            continue
        updated_parts.append(part)

    updated_command = " ".join(updated_parts)

    # Retrieve the git suggested command from stderr
    push_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    git_command_index = -1
    for i in range(len(push_lines)):
        if 'git push' in push_lines[i]:
            git_command_index = i
            break

    if git_command_index != -1:
        push_upstream = push_lines[git_command_index].partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(updated_command, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return updated_command
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and extracts the git suggested push command from the `stderr` in a more robust manner, addressing the issues described in the GitHub reports.
