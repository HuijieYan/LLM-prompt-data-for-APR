### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function receives a command and tries to modify it based on certain conditions. The function searches for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command's parts list and removes it along with its argument. Then, it extracts the relevant part from the command's stderr to construct a new command.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The logic to check and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option seems incorrect.
2. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` might be problematic.

### Cause of the bug
1. In the provided case, the function incorrectly removes the second occurrence of the specified option in the `command.script_parts` list. This results in an incorrect new command formation.
2. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` is incorrect due to slicing.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. The function should correctly identify and remove the correct occurrence of the specified option from the list.
2. The `push_upstream` extraction should be modified to parse the relevant information correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument also

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('fatal:')[-1].strip().partition('git push')[2].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues by correctly identifying and removing the specified options and extracting the `push_upstream` value from the appropriate part of the `command.stderr`.
