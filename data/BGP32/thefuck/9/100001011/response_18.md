### Analysis
The buggy function is meant to process the output of a failed `git push` command and suggest a corrected command. The function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command and its argument if present, and then construct a new command based on the output.

### Error Location
The error in the function lies in how it attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`, as it only removes the option once even if it appears multiple times in the list.

### Cause of the Bug
In the provided case, the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of `-u`, but the correction implementation only removes it once. However, when constructing the new command by concatenating the remaining script parts, the `-u` option is still present in the script parts list, causing an incorrect suggestion.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove all occurrences of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list before constructing the new command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove all occurrences of it and its argument.
    modified_script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    modified_script_parts = [part for part in modified_script_parts if part != '--set-upstream' and part != '-u']

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(modified_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first create a copy of the `command.script_parts` list and filter out all occurrences of `--set-upstream` and `-u`. Then, we construct the new command based on this modified list, ensuring that the incorrect options are removed before suggesting the corrected command.
