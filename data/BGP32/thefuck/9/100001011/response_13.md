### Analyzing the buggy function

The function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command based on the output of a previous execution. The function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the command and then constructs a new command based on the output of the stderr regarding setting the upstream branch.

### Identified issues
1. The function uses multiple try-except blocks to check for the existence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, but it does not handle the correct removal of the respective options from the `script_parts`.
2. The function incorrectly assumes the index of the value to remove in the `script_parts`.
3. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the error message is also incorrect, leading to an improper construction of the new command.

### Cause of the bug
The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect removal and construction of the commands. The incorrect assumption of index values and the improper parsing of the stderr message result in an erroneous output command. This leads to unexpected behavior when the corrected command is suggested.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `script_parts`.
2. Ensure correct parsing of the error message to extract the relevant information for the new command.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    updated_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying original list
    if '--set-upstream' in updated_parts:
        updated_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in updated_parts:
        updated_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = ' '.join(command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[1:])
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

In this corrected version:
- The function now creates a copy of `command.script_parts` and modifies this copy instead of directly manipulating the original list.
- It properly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `script_parts`.
- The `push_upstream` extraction is updated to get the correct values from the error message.

This corrected version should address the issues and provide the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issues.
