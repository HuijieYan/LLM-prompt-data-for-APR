### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the given command based on certain conditions and return the modified command. However, the code has several issues:
1. The logic to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command script parts is incorrect.
2. The extraction of `push_upstream` from the command.stderr assumes a fixed format, which may not always be the case.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command script parts is flawed. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` based on a fixed position in the stderr may lead to incorrect results based on varying error messages.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of looking for the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` separately, we should search for either one of them and then remove it.
2. Improve the parsing of `push_upstream` by locating and extracting the relevant information more effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract push_upstream from stderr more reliably
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    potential_line = lines[-3].strip()
    if potential_line.startswith('fatal:'):
        push_upstream = ' '.join(potential_line.split()[2:])
    else:
        # If the format is different, consider a fallback
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the above corrected version of the function, the bug in the logic for removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` and the extraction of `push_upstream` should be resolved.
