### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, the GitHub issue
The buggy function is designed to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is passed in the `git push` command. It removes this option and its argument from the command and suggests a corrected version of the command based on the stderr output. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the suggestions for the corrected command are incorrect after a certain code change (#538).

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The variable `upstream_option_index` is being checked with `is not -1` instead of `!= -1`.
2. The logic to retrieve the argument after the string "git" is incorrect.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` check and the incorrect retrieval of the push upstream argument from the stderr message. This leads to suggestions for the corrected command that are not accurate.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the condition check for `upstream_option_index` to use `!= -1` instead of `is not -1`.
2. Revise the logic to correctly extract the push upstream argument from the stderr message.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    push_upstream = push_upstream.replace('-u ' + command.script_parts[-1], '')
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues identified above. It correctly handles the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, adjusts the retrieval of the push upstream argument from the stderr message, and provides accurate suggestions for the corrected command.
