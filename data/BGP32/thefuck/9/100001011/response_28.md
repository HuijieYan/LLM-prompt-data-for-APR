### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag along with its argument, concatenating the remaining arguments to the command suggested by git, and replacing the 'push' command with the extracted push upstream. 

### Error Location:
The issue lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is being checked after the two try-except blocks, and the incorrect pop of the elements when removing the flag and its argument.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is being checked using an incorrect condition, as `is not -1` instead of `!= -1`. This leads to incorrect removal of the '-u' flag and its argument even if one of them is found.
2. When removing the '-u' flag and its argument, the pop operation is called twice on the same index, which results in removing the wrong elements.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition to properly check if the flag or its short version exists.
2. Adjust the logic for removing the flag and its argument to ensure correct elements are popped.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the identification and removal of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags along with their respective arguments, ensuring the proper modification of the git push command as intended.
