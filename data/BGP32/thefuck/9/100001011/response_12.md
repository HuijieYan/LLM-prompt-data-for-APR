### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the output of a failed `git push` command and suggest a corrected command based on the error message. The function attempts to detect if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option was used in the original command and remove it to construct the corrected command. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect index handling when removing the upstream option and its argument.

### Bug
The bug occurs when attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the list of command parts. The issue lies in the way the function is attempting to locate and remove these elements from the list. The index used for removal is not correctly handled.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and remove both the option and its argument from the list. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr should be modified to ensure the correct command is generated.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().split('use\n\n')[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by correctly handling the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. It also extracts the `push_upstream` value from the correct position in the stderr to ensure the correct command suggestion is generated.
