### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command, and replacing the push argument with the correct upstream branch. However, the bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the upstream_option_index and removal of the elements from the command.script_parts list.

### Bug Location
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is incorrectly checked for `-1` to determine whether the flag was found in the command.
2. When removing the found option from `command.script_parts`, it removes both the flag and its argument incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly handle the search for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Adjust the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` to correctly remove only the flag and its argument.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    flags_to_remove = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for flag in flags_to_remove:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove the flag
            if flag_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Correction Rationale
1. The corrected function iterates over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags to find and remove them.
2. When removing the flag, it also checks if an argument is present after the flag and removes that accordingly. This resolves the issue of incorrectly removing elements from `command.script_parts`.
