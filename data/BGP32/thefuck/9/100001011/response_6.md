### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command script based on the stderr output of a git push command. It tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command and replace the `push` argument with the suggested argument from the git push output.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `upstream_option_index is not -1` should be `upstream_option_index != -1`. The current condition will not work as intended.
2. Using `command.script_parts.index('-u')` will always give the index of `-u` regardless of whether `--set-upstream` is present, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of option removal and incorrect parsing of the command script. The index of the `-u` option is fetched without considering the presence of the `--set-upstream` option, leading to incorrect removal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. First, check for the index of `--set-upstream` in the `command.script_parts`. If found, remove it properly.
2. Use a conditional check to avoid fetching the index of `-u` if `--set-upstream` has already been removed.
3. Update the condition checking for the correct comparison operator.
4. Properly extract the `push` argument from the stderr output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove --set-upstream
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # only search for -u if --set-upstream is not found
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove -u
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the removal of options and extract the `push` argument, addressing the issues reported in the GitHub bug reports.
