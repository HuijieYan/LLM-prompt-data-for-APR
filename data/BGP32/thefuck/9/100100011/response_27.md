The buggy function is `get_new_command` in the `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` file. The function is supposed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then appending the correct upstream branch. The buggy behavior seems to be related to handling the upstream option index and concatenating the upstream branch correctly.

The main issue in the code is that the upstream_option_index is being updated twice without considering the second 'try' block properly. If the '-u' option is present after the first 'try' block, it gets overridden by the second 'try' block which causes the wrong index to be considered for removal. Additionally, the pop operations to remove the option and its argument are incorrect as well.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the '-u' option index is only updated if it was not already updated by the '--set-upstream' option. Then, we need to correct the pop operations to remove the option and its argument correctly. Finally, we should extract the correct upstream branch without any errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the '-u' or '--set-upstream' option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options correctly and provide the expected output after extracting the correct upstream branch. This should resolve the failing test cases and also address the reported GitHub issues.
