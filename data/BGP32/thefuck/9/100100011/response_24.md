## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to fix and modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and then replacing the argument with the correct one obtained from the stderr output.

The primary issue in the buggy function lies in the incorrect handling of multiple occurrences of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command. It only removes the first occurrence instead of handling all occurrences properly. This results in an inaccurate final command reconstruction.

Additionally, the method used to extract the correct push URL from the stderr is fragile and assumes a specific line position.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to remove only the first occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command instead of handling all occurrences, leading to incorrect command modification.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Replace the try-except block with a loop that iterates over all occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command.
2. Modify the extraction of the push URL from `stderr` to be more robust and not rely on a specific line position.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove all occurrences of --set-upstream or -u and their arguments
    index_remove = []
    for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            index_remove.extend([idx, idx + 1])
    command.script_parts = [part for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if idx not in index_remove]

    # Extract push URL from the stderr
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n')[::-1]:
        if not line or line.startswith(" ") or line.startswith("\t"):
            continue
        push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
        break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying the above correction to the function, the `get_new_command` function should now handle all occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly and extract the push URL from `stderr` in a more robust manner. This should resolve the reported issues and make the function behave as expected.
