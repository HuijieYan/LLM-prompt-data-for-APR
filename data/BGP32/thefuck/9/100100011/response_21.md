### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for a failed `git push` operation. It removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command and then extracts the suggested command from the error message to construct a new command.

### Identified Errors:
1. The removal of the flag and its argument is not correctly handled in the current implementation.
2. The extraction of the suggested push command from the error message might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from not properly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument in the `get_new_command` function. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested push command might not be accurate, which leads to incorrect command construction.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly track and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument.
2. Validate the error message extraction logic to obtain the correct suggested push command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    try:
        upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extracting correct suggested push command
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the initial function by properly handling the removal of the flag and its argument and adjusting the extraction of the suggested push command. This should resolve the failing test and address the reported GitHub issues.
