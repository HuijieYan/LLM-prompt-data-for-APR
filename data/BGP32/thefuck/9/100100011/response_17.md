### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and then replacing the `push` command with the actual upstream branch suggested by `git`. The function seems to have an issue with handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly.

### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `upstream_option_index` is not correctly updated when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present.
2. Removing the option and its argument is not handled properly for both cases.
3. Retrieving the suggested branch from `stderr` may not work correctly under certain conditions.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of multiple occurrences of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option in the `command.script_parts`. The function does not account for situations where both options are present, leading to incorrect removals and replacements. This results in an incorrect final output when generating the new command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options and their arguments are correctly handled.
2. Validate the logic for updating `upstream_option_index` based on the presence of the options.
3. Retrieve the correct suggested branch from `stderr` by considering the possible edge cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Extract the suggested branch
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Generate the new command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By handling the removal of both options correctly and updating the retrieval of the suggested branch, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
