### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the `git push` command based on the output in the stderr.
2. The function tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command parts list and removes those parts from the command before constructing the new command.
3. The bug seems to be related to the removal of `-u` flag when present in the command parts list.
4. The failing test cases provided suggest that the function is not handling the `-u` flag correctly when constructing the new command.
5. The issue reported on GitHub also points out a specific scenario where the suggestion is incorrect due to the introduced bug.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the way the function handles the removal of the `-u` flag from the command parts list. When the function tries to find the index of `-u`, it could overwrite the index set by `--set-upstream` and end up not removing the `-u` flag correctly, leading to incorrect suggestions in the new command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are handled independently to avoid overwriting the index.
2. The logic to remove the flags from the command parts list needs to be adjusted to consider both flags.
3. The function should also check whether the provided stderr contains the necessary information to construct the new command properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing --set-upstream or -u flags and their arguments from the command parts list
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove flag
            if flag_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove argument, if present
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are correctly handled and removed from the command parts list. By iterating over both flags separately, we avoid the issue of overwriting the index and ensure the correct construction of the new command.
