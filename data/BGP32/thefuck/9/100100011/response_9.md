### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command passed to it by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments and replacing the `push` command with the suggested upstream branch.
2. The main issue is with how the function handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The logic to remove these options is flawed and doesn't handle multiple occurrences correctly.
3. The failing test in `test_get_new_command` indicates that the function is not providing the expected output when handling different scenarios involving the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the code stems from the way the function deals with removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The function only removes the first occurrence of these options and doesn't consider potential multiple occurrences or their arguments. This causes the output to be incorrect for scenarios where multiple occurrences of these options exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options to handle all occurrences and their arguments correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly extracts the suggested upstream branch from the stderr based on the provided scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing all occurrences of --set-upstream or -u options
    command.script_parts = [arg for arg in command.script_parts if arg not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    # Extract the suggested upstream branch from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the 'push' command with the suggested upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now handle multiple occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and extract the correct upstream branch from the stderr. This should allow the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
