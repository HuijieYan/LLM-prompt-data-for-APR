### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command based on the stderr output of the `git push` command. It searches for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command and removes them. Then, it extracts the suggested upstream branch from the stderr to replace the destination branch in the original command.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options is incorrect.
2. Incorrectly assuming the stderr always contains specific messages in specific positions.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the search for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command is not working correctly. The logic to remove those options is flawed, leading to incorrect processing of the command. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested upstream branch from stderr assumes a fixed position that is not reliable.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic to search for and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.
2. Enhance the method to extract the suggested upstream branch from the stderr in a more reliable manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' options
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)

    # Extract suggested upstream branch more reliably from stderr
    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for part in reversed(stderr_parts):
        if part.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = part.partition('git push ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # Fallback if upstream branch not found in stderr
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

By updating the `get_new_command` function with the corrected logic as shown above, the issue of incorrect '--set-upstream' or '-u' option removal and unreliable suggested upstream branch extraction should be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the reported GitHub issues.
