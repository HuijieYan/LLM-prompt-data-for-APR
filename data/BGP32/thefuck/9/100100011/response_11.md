### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the git push command based on the stderr output from a git push operation. It specifically tries to remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the original command and replace it with the appropriate push upstream suggestion.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` should be `if upstream_option_index != -1` or `if upstream_option_index >= 0` for checking the index correctly.
2. The pop operation should be on `upstream_option_index`, not just a generic location.
3. Retrieving the git push suggestion by splitting the stderr might be problematic if the output format changes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing incorrect modifications to the command due to the incorrect handling of index positions. This leads to incorrect suggestions being generated based on the provided input options.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition for checking the index.
2. Use the found index for pop operations to remove the specific options.
3. Ensure that the extraction of the push upstream suggestion is reliable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop again for the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

In the corrected version, the indexing and handling of options have been revised to ensure the correct modification of the git push command.
