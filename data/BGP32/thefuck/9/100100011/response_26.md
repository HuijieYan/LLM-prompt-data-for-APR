## Analysis:
The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify a Git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replacing the `push` argument with the actual branch to be pushed. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling all cases, leading to failing tests.

### Bugs:
1. The code has a logical error when trying to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. If the first `try` block sets `upstream_option_index`, the second `try` block will always override it. This leads to incorrect handling of the option and its argument.

2. The pop operation is done twice on the `command.script_parts`, which is incorrect.

3. The code assumes that the actual branch name to be pushed is always the third element from the end in the `stderr`, which is not a robust way to extract the branch name.

### GitHub Issues:
The provided GitHub issues show examples of incorrect suggestions for `git push -u myfork` command. The expected result should be `git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and handle it properly.
2. Extract the actual branch name to be pushed from the stderr in a more reliable way.
3. Amend the final command generation to include the correct branch name.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u option
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract the branch name to be pushed
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split()[-1].strip()

    # Construct the updated command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function, it should now handle the Git push commands correctly and pass the failing tests provided.
