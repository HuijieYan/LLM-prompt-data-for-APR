### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the input command and concatenating the remaining arguments to suggest a corrected git push command.
2. The bug seems to be related to the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the script parts.
3. The failing test cases are provided with different variations of the git push command, including `-u` and other arguments. The function fails to produce the correct suggestion.
4. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect removal of the specified option from the script parts.
5. To fix the bug, ensure that the `pop` operation on `command.script_parts` removes both the option and its argument correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is another item to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the `get_new_command` function with the corrected index check and removal of the option and its argument, the function should now work correctly and pass the provided failing test cases.
