### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify the `git push` command based on the output received. The main issue arises from how it handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the input command. Additionally, there is an issue in determining the correct push destination.

### Error Locations:
1. Error in removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the input command.
2. Error in extracting the correct push destination from the stderr.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command, which results in incorrect command modification. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected modified command and the actual output received from the test.

In addition, the method of extracting the push destination from `stderr` using `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` can be unreliable if the error message format changes.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the input command.
2. Use a more robust method to extract the push destination from the stderr.
3. Ensure that the modified command matches the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flags if present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the correct push destination from stderr
    push_info = command.stderr.split(':')[-1].strip()
    if 'use' in push_info:
        push_upstream = push_info.split('\n')[0].strip()
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function improves the logic to correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and extracts the push destination in a more reliable manner from the stderr information. This version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported on GitHub.
