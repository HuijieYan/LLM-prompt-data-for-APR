### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the command given based on specific conditions related to git push options.
2. The function attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, remove those indexes, and then extract the suggestion to replace the 'push' argument with the retrieved value.
3. The bug appears to be related to not correctly handling the removal of the found indexes and possibly not correctly parsing the suggestion from stderr.
4. The failing test indicates that the function is not providing the expected output for different variations of 'git push' commands.
5. The GitHub issues highlight specific instances where the suggestions provided by the function are incorrect, indicating a direct correlation between the bug and the reported problems.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by:
1. Incorrectly handling the removal of the found indexes of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Improperly extracting the suggestion from `command.stderr` and further manipulating the command based on that suggestion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle the removal of indexes while considering multiple occurrences of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Ensure the suggestion extraction from `command.stderr` is done accurately to provide the intended output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indices = []
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    upstream_option_indices.sort(reverse=True)
    
    for upstream_option_index in upstream_option_indices:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream_str = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]
    push_upstream = push_upstream_str[push_upstream_str.rfind('git ')+4:].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Conclusion:
The bug in the original function has been addressed by correctly handling the removal of indexes and extracting the push upstream argument from the git stderr output. The provided corrected version should resolve the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issues related to incorrect suggestions for `git push` commands.
