The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the index when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. The current implementation only removes the first occurrence of the option, leading to an incorrect command generated.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, regardless of the index where they are found.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this modification, we ensure that both the option and its argument are removed correctly from the `command.script_parts`. This will result in the correct git push command being generated and the failing test will pass as expected.
