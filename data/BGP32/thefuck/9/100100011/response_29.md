### Analysis:
The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle Git push commands, specifically removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the removal of these options and arguments, leading to incorrect output.

The failing test function `test_get_new_command` is testing various scenarios of Git push commands with `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and asserts the expected output. The fix for the bug lies in properly handling the removal of these options and arguments and constructing the new command as expected.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The implementation does not account for the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect index being used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The `upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')` line overwrites the `upstream_option_index` value even if `--set-upstream` option is present. This leads to improper removal of options and arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. We should check for both options and their arguments separately and remove them accordingly. Additionally, we should handle cases where either option is not present in the command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments, ensuring that the new command is constructed correctly. It should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
