### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the Test Code

The buggy function `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file is supposed to handle git push commands with the --set-upstream or -u option by removing them from the command and its argument. It then extracts the branch name from the stderr and appends it to the corrected command.

The test function `test_get_new_command` is testing the behavior of the `get_new_command` function with different variations of git push commands.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The logic to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options might not be correctly handling both cases.
2. Extracting the branch name from `stderr` might not be accurate.
3. The final corrected command generation may not be combining the parts correctly.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of finding the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options. Additionally, the extraction of the branch name from `stderr` using `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` can cause issues if the error message format changes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly handle the extraction of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' indexes.
2. Safely extract the branch name from `stderr`.
3. Create the corrected command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and combining the parts efficiently.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]  # Extract last word after splitting by space
    corrected_command = command.script_parts.copy()
    corrected_command.extend(['--set-upstream', push_upstream, 'master'])  # Assume default remote and branch name

    return " ".join(corrected_command)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u', extract the branch name safely from `stderr`, and generate the correct corrected command.
