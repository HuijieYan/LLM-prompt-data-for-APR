### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the `git push` command and modify it based on the stderr output. The main issue seems to be with handling the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command.

### Error Locations:
1. The try-except blocks for finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` are independent of each other and will override `upstream_option_index` with the value of `-1` or the `-u` index in case `--set-upstream` index is already found before that.
2. After removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` from `command.script_parts`, the next line assumes that `stderr` always contains the required information at a fixed location (`[-3]`), which can cause an index out of range error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the command, leading to incorrect indexing and slicing of the `stderr` output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a single try-except block to find the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Check the availability of required information in `stderr` before its direct usage.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(parts) >= 3:
        push_upstream = parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return ""
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `git push` command and extract the required push upstream information from the stderr output without causing any index errors.
