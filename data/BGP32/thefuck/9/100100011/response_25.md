### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument and replacing the push arguments with the updated information obtained from stderr. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling the upstream option index and not correctly updating the new command with the required information.

### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the upstream option index.
2. Incorrectly modifying the script_parts after removing the upstream option.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the upstream option index. The function does not correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script_parts. Additionally, after removing the upstream option from script_parts, the new push command is not updated with the correct upstream information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and handle both cases.
2. Update the new push command with the correct upstream information obtained from stderr.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    if push_upstream:
        new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        new_command = "git push --set-upstream origin master"

    return new_command
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function now correctly handles the identification and removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command script_parts. It also properly updates the new push command with the obtained upstream information from stderr. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test cases in `test_git_push.py` pass successfully.
