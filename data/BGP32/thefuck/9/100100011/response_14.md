### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command based on certain conditions, like removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument.
2. The buggy function seems to have issues in handling the index of the `upstream_option_index`.
3. The failing test in `test_git_push.py` checks for different scenarios of commands and the expected output, which are not met due to the bug in the `get_new_command` function.
4. The GitHub issues point out specific scenarios where the suggestion output is incorrect when using `git push -u`.

### Bug Fixes:
1. Fix the handling of the `upstream_option_index` index in the function to correctly remove the flag and its argument.
2. Ensure the correct parsing of `push_upstream` to extract the required part after the 'git' command.
3. Update the logic to consider the different scenarios mentioned in the failing test cases and GitHub issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return "git push --set-upstream " + push_upstream
```

### Note:
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues with incorrect index handling and correctly assigns the `push_upstream` value. This should now pass the failing tests and resolve the reported GitHub issues related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u` scenarios.
