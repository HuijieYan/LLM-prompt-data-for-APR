### Analysis:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to how it handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command string and how it extracts the branch name from the git push command's stderr.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `command.script_parts.index` to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Extracting the branch name from `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and not correctly extracting the branch from the command. This results in an incorrect output when forming the new command.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Ensure that the correct index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is removed.
2. Modify the logic for extracting the branch name from the stderr of the git push command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("--set-upstream")
    elif "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("-u")
    
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split("\n")[-3].strip().partition(" ")[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), "push", push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
- Instead of using `try-except` for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, we directly check their presence in `command.script_parts`.
- The extraction of the branch name from `stderr` is fixed by correctly splitting the text and getting the necessary information.
- Proper removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is ensured.

By applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
