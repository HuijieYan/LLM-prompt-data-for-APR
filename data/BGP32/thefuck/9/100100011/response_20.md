### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command string based on the input command and stderr output. However, there are multiple issues in the function that cause it to fail the provided test cases. First, the logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list is incorrect. It needs to handle both cases separately. Second, the logic to extract the `push_upstream` part from `command.stderr` is incorrect. It needs to be handled more robustly to ensure correct retrieval.

### Bug Description:
In the buggy function `get_new_command`:
1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` is flawed.
2. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is inaccurate, assuming it always appears as the third line from the end.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately in `command.script_parts`.
2. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` in a more reliable manner.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for --set-upstream or -u and remove them from script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract push upstream from stderr more robustly
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Note:
Make sure to test the corrected function with the provided test cases to ensure that it passes and resolves the GitHub issues mentioned.
