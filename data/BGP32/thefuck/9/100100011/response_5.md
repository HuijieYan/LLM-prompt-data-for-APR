### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case when the user includes `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the git push command. It is supposed to remove these options and their arguments and construct a new git push command with the correct arguments based on the output of the original command. The issue seems to be related to handling the upstream option and constructing the new command properly.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that when removing the upstream option and its argument, the function doesn't check if the option was successfully found in the `script_parts`. This leads to potential issues when accessing elements in the list and constructing the new command.

### Explanation:
The bug originates from the way the code handles the removal of the upstream option index. If the first condition fails to find the index, the second condition might find it, but the removal logic isn't correct as it removes the same index twice. Also, the usage of `is not -1` is incorrect; it should be `!= -1`. Additionally, the parsing of `push_upstream` from `stderr` may not work correctly in all cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle the removal of the upstream option index by checking both possible cases separately.
2. Update the condition to check for `!= -1` instead of `is not -1`.
3. Improve the parsing of `push_upstream` string from `stderr`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract push upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these corrections, the `get_new_command` function should now be able to handle the removal of upstream options correctly and construct the new git push command based on the provided output.

This updated version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues reported on GitHub related to the incorrect suggestions for git push commands.
