**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process the git push command and handle options like --set-upstream and -u. 
2. The buggy function extracts the push command from the stderr and replaces "push" with it in the command script parts.
3. The buggy function is failing to handle the situation correctly when --set-upstream or -u is present in the command, resulting in incorrect parsing and removal of option and argument.
4. The failing test cases highlight the issue by expecting specific output that is not being generated by the current implementation.
5. The GitHub issue provides additional context about the problem and its impact on actual usage.

**Bug:**
The bug is in the handling of --set-upstream or -u options in the git push command. The function incorrectly removes these options and arguments, leading to incorrect output.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Update the code to properly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u options and their corresponding arguments.
2. Ensure that the correct push command is extracted from the stderr when forming the new command.
3. Refactor the function to correctly handle all scenarios of input options.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the function as above, it correctly handles the removal of --set-upstream or -u options and provides the expected new command output.
