### Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by a mistake in removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`. The index used for popping the elements is being used twice, causing an `IndexError` when attempting to pop the index the second time. The correct approach would be to only pop the index once.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' if present
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if still within bounds after removing the first element
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should now pass all the failing test cases you provided.
