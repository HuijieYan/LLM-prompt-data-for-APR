### Fixing the Bug

#### Bug Analysis
The bug in the given code is due to a wrong index being used to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. The code attempts to remove an item from the list at the same index twice after the index is found, which results in an `IndexError`.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is used to remove the item from the list. Additionally, we should verify if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command before attempting to remove them.

#### Corrected Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, with the above corrected function, the test cases should pass without any errors.
