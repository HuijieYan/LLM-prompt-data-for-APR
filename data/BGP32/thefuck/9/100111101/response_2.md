## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. When trying to remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice, the second `pop()` operation raises an `IndexError` because the list has already been modified and the index is out of range.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when removing the specified index from the list, we only remove it once and then update the index accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the corrected function correctly extracts the push command from the `push stderr` output.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # The remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should handle the removal of the upstream options correctly and extract the push command from the stderr message as expected by the test cases.
