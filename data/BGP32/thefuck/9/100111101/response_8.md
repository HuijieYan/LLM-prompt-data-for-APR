### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to correctly handle removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The issue lies in the loop that removes these elements. After the removal of the first occurrence, the list shifts, causing the index of the second occurrence to change. The buggy function does not account for this shift, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the element at the new index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the index when removing the second occurrence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. We can achieve this by first collecting the indices of the options to remove and then removing them in reverse order to avoid affecting the subsequent indices.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    to_remove = []
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        to_remove.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        to_remove.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))

    to_remove.sort(reverse=True)  # Reverse order to maintain index integrity
    for idx in to_remove:
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Correct for the shift after the first pop

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass as expected.
