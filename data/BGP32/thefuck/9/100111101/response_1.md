### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the logic used to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the command. The issue occurs when attempting to remove these elements through the `pop` function. If the '--set-upstream' option is found, it is removed, but the subsequent removal of the argument at the same index is causing an `IndexError` because the list reduces in size after the first pop operation. This leads to the incorrect behavior of not removing the argument that follows the option.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the removal of the argument corresponding to the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option should be handled correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to always pop the argument immediately after removing the option. Additionally, the possibility of encountering both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options should also be considered.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    options_to_remove = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in options_to_remove:
        while option in script_parts:
            option_index = script_parts.index(option)
            script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            if option_index < len(script_parts):
                script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument
                
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By iterating through the `options_to_remove` list, this corrected version ensures that both the option and its argument are removed correctly without causing an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function maintains the integrity of the command list by operating on a copy of `command.script_parts`.
