### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process a git command by removing certain options if present and then replacing an argument. The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is handled along with the incorrect use of `pop` in this context.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes an `IndexError` due to incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index`. In cases where the `upstream_option_index` is found for `-u`, it is removed correctly, but then it is removed again assuming it is still `-u` which leads to an index out of range error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, the `upstream_option_index` should be correctly removed once when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found. Instead of using `pop` twice, it should be removed only once.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` and produce the expected outputs for the failing test cases.
