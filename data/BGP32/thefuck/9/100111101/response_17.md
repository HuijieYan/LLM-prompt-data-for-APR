### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect removal of the upstream option index. The code attempts to remove the same index twice, which leads to an `IndexError` in the case where `-u` is present in the `script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by making sure that the index removal is only done once, regardless of whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `script_parts`. We should also handle the case where these options are not present.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By using this corrected version, the function should work correctly with the provided test cases and handle the different scenarios without causing an `IndexError`.
