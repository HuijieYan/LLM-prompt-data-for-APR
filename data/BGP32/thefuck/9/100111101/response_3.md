### Explanation:
The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by popping the `upstream_option_index` twice when the `-u` flag is present in the `command.script_parts`. This results in an `IndexError` because popping once would shift the indexes, making the second pop refer to an index that is out of range.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly and then construct the new command with the correct arguments.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.pop(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.pop(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    
    # Extract the desired push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Construct and return the new push command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now that we have correctly removed the flags and constructed the new push command, the function should be able to pass the failing test cases provided.
