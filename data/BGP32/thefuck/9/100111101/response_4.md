### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from removing the same element twice from the `command.script_parts` list when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. This causes an `IndexError` on the second attempt to remove the already deleted element, leading to a failure in the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present, it is only removed once from the `command.script_parts` list. We can achieve this by tracking whether the option has been found and removed already, and then processing accordingly.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Ensure the second pop only happens when the first pop is successful
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option correctly, addressing the `IndexError` and passing all the failing test cases.
