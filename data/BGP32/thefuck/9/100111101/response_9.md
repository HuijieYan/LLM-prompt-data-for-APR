### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. When the `upstream_option_index` is found to be not -1 (meaning the 'set-upstream' option was present), the code attempts to remove the item at the index `upstream_option_index` twice. This causes an `IndexError` because when the first element is removed, the list gets shorter and the index position for the second removal is no longer valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the 'set-upstream' option is found, we only remove it once from the `command.script_parts` list. 

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if '--set-upstream' was not found before trying '-u'
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option only once
        # Optionally remove the next element if it was the argument to the removed option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should now handle the 'set-upstream' option removal correctly and pass the failing test cases.
