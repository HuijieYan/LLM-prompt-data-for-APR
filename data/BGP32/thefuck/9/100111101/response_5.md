### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the conditional check `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` is using the wrong comparison operator, which should be `!=` instead of `is not`. The current implementation checks identity rather than equality, causing the condition to fail even when `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1`. Additionally, there is an index error when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts` multiple times.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Change the comparison `is not -1` to `!= -1` for the correct check of `-1` equality.
2. Adjust the logic to remove the `upstream_option_index` element once, not twice.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
