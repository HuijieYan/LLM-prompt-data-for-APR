### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `get_new_command()` function arises from how the upstream_option_index is handled when the `-u` flag is present in the command. The intention is to remove the `-u` flag and its argument if present in the command script_parts, but due to incorrect indexing and duplication in the removal process, an IndexError occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `upstream_option_index` check handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly.
2. Adjust the removal logic to correctly remove the detected flag and its argument once without repetitions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these changes, the `get_new_command()` function should now be able to handle the `-u` flag correctly and remove it along with its argument without causing index errors.
