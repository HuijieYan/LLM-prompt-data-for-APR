The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. When an element is removed from the list, the indices of subsequent elements will change. The function is trying to remove the same index twice, which leads to an `IndexError`.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
- Find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts`.
- If the index is found, remove it once from the list.
- Update the index if it was for `-u`, as `-u` takes up one argument slot.
- Retrieve the push command from `command.stderr`.
- Replace the 'push' argument in the `command.script_parts` with the push command obtained from stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if option == '-u':
                index -= 1
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            break
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the index manipulation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
