### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs due to an incorrect indexing operation when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the list of command parts. The buggy code attempts to remove the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found in the list of command parts, it is removed only once along with its corresponding argument. We should also handle cases where the flag occurs at different positions in the list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the `get_new_command` function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, ensuring that the function passes the failing test cases.
