The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to incorrectly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its corresponding value from the `command.script_parts` list. The buggy function was attempting to remove the two elements at the same index, which was causing an `IndexError` because `pop` was called twice with the same index when the argument was found.

To fix this bug, we should remove the following line:

```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

and adjust the subsequent line to only remove once:

```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

This way, we ensure that if the argument and its value are found, they are correctly removed from the list.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
