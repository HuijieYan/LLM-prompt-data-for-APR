## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from how the removal of the upstream option is handled. The code attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the list `command.script_parts`, but the removal logic is incorrect. When an option is found, not only is the value removed at that index, but the subsequent value is also removed in the attempt to maintain the correct structure of the command.

The error occurs because after removing the option at index `upstream_option_index`, the subsequent value is also removed using the same index, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to remove again at the same index where an element was already removed.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the option and its argument. After removing the option, we should only remove the argument at the next index to maintain the correct structure of the command.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(command.script_parts) if x in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for upstream_option_index in upstream_option_indices:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the removal of the option and its argument by ensuring that only the argument is removed following the removal of the option.

With this fix in place, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
