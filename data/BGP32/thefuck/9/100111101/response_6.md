## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a command for Git push operations. It is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments and then replace the `push` command with the actual branch to be pushed. The bug occurs in the removal of the flags and their arguments when they are present in the command script parts.

The bug causes an IndexError when attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. This error arises because when an option is found at one index, the removal operation shifts the subsequent indexes, leading to an incorrect removal index for the next option.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`. Instead of directly removing at the found index, we need to store the found indexes and then remove them in reverse order (from highest index to lowest). By doing this, we ensure that the removal process does not affect the indexing of other elements that need to be removed.

## Updated Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = []
    try:
        upstream_option_indexes.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_indexes.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Remove the options and their arguments in reverse order to prevent shifting indexes
    for i in sorted(upstream_option_indexes, reverse=True):
        command.script_parts.pop(i)
        # If it's an option and has an argument, remove the argument too
        if len(command.script_parts) > i and not command.script_parts[i].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(i)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function properly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments without causing any shifting of indexes, thereby preventing the IndexError.
