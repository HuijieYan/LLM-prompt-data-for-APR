The bug in the provided function is that the second try statement for finding the index of the '-u' flag in the command is not handling the case when the '--set-upstream' flag is already found in the command and its index is stored in 'upstream_option_index'. Since the second try statement always executes regardless of the first one, it overwrites the index value with the index of '-u' if it exists. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual behavior of the function, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the second try statement to find the index of '-u' only executes if the '--set-upstream' flag has not been found previously. Additionally, updating the index in both cases will resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # only execute if '--set-upstream' was not found
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the index of the '-u' flag is only updated if the '--set-upstream' flag was not found earlier. It fixes the bug by correctly handling both flag scenarios and providing the expected behavior for the given input cases.
