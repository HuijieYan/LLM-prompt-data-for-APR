The buggy function is designed to modify a git command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command's script parts list and replacing the `push` command argument with the suggestion extracted from the stderr of the command. 

The bug in the function lies in the way it tries to identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the list of script parts. The function incorrectly handles the case when the `-u` option is present in the command script parts list. When both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, the function only removes and updates the `-u` option, leading to incorrect command modification.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify and remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options if present in the command script parts list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    remove_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for opt in remove_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the command script parts list and removes them along with their arguments if present.
