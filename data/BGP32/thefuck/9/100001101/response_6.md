### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in how the if condition is checking the value of `upstream_option_index`. The current comparison `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` should actually be `if upstream_option_index != -1:` to properly check if the index was found in the `script_parts`. Additionally, the pop operation is removing elements incorrectly as it should only remove the single occurrence of the item at the found index. The final issue is that `push_upstream` is derived from splitting the stderr, which is not accurate because it should be derived from the `command.script_parts` directly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the comparison of `upstream_option_index` in the if condition to `if upstream_option_index != -1:`.
2. Adjust the pop operation to only remove the single occurrence of the item at the found index.
3. Get `push_upstream` directly from the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    return replace_argument(push_upstream, 'push', 'push --set-upstream origin master')
``` 

The corrected version handles the comparison correctly, adjusts the pop operations, and correctly derives `push_upstream` directly from the `command.script_parts`.
