The bug in the function lies in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` index. The current implementation always sets `upstream_option_index` to the index of `-u`, overriding any previous value set for `--set-upstream`.

To fix this bug, we need to check both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and update the index based on the first one found. Then, we can remove the correct index and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and remove the correct index and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.
