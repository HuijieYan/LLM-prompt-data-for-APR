### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, concatenate the remaining arguments into a new command, and replace the 'push' command with the output obtained from the `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]`. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is incorrect due to the way the index is searched and removed.
2. The extraction of the suggested git command from `command.stderr` requires a more robust approach.
3. The return statement combining the modified command parts needs to be adjusted to replace the 'push' command with the extracted suggestion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument in a single pass.
2. Implement a more reliable method to extract the suggested git command from the `command.stderr`.
3. Correctly update the new command by replacing the 'push' command with the extracted suggestion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested git command correctly
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith("git push"):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    # Replace 'push' command with the extracted suggestion
    new_command = " ".join(script_parts)
    return replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_upstream)
```

By implementing the above corrected version of the function, the issues in the buggy implementation should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle the input parameters and produce the expected output in all test cases.
