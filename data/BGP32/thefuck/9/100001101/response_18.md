### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` variable is handled. The code checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, but if the latter is found after the former, it will overwrite the index instead of adding another one. Additionally, when removing the option and its argument, it should only remove once, not twice as currently coded.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle finding both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. We also need to remove the option and its argument only once if found.

### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = index
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and remove them along with their arguments as needed.
