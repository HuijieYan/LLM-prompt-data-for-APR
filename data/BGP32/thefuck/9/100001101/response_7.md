## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is due to the way the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is determined. The code uses two separate `try` blocks to find the index, but the second `try` block overwrites the value of `upstream_option_index` set by the first block. Hence, the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` will always be true, leading to incorrect removal of the options from the `command.script_parts`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index of the option is correctly identified and then removed from the list of script parts. We also need to extract the correct push command from the stderr message. Instead of using two separate `try` blocks, we can check both options in a single block and update the index accordingly.

## Corrected Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Initialize the variable to store the index of the option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    # Check both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in a single block
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Remove the option and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Pop again to remove the argument
        
    # Extract the correct push command from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the argument and return the updated command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using a single loop to check both options, the correct index is retained. Additionally, the function now correctly extracts the push command from the stderr message and returns the updated command as expected.
