The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect handling of the search for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option within the `command.script_parts`. The function incorrectly removes both the option and its argument if found, leading to an incorrect final command creation.

To fix the bug, we should only remove the found option and its argument once, regardless of whether it is '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Additionally, the logic for extracting the push command suggested by git from `command.stderr` is correct and doesn't need modification.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that only the correct '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its respective argument are removed from the `command.script_parts`. This change aligns with the expected behavior described in the test cases.
