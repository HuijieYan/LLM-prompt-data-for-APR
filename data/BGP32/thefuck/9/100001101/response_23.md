### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to modify a Git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument if present, and replacing the `push` command with the suggested command from the stderr message.

### Issues
1. The code attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, but only removes one occurrence.
2. The last line extracts the suggested `git` command incorrectly from `command.stderr`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code only removes the flag and its argument once, resulting in incorrect command modification. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested `git` command from `command.stderr` is faulty.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the code to find the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` simultaneously.
2. Use a more robust method to extract the suggested `git` command reliably from `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract suggested git command correctly
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Solution
The corrected code will properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments. It will also extract the suggested `git` command accurately from the stderr message.
