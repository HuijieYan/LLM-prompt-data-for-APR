## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` variable is calculated. In the buggy code, the second try block for finding the index of `-u` always executes, regardless of whether `--set-upstream` was found before. This results in the wrong index being stored in `upstream_option_index`, causing issues when trying to remove the option and its argument.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should check if the `--set-upstream` option has already been found before attempting to find the `-u` option. This ensures that we only store the correct index for the intended option to remove.

## Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected code includes a check for whether `--set-upstream` was found before attempting to find the `-u` option. This ensures that the correct index is stored for removal, fixing the bug.
