### Analysis
The buggy function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command, as they are already included in the suggestion provided by git. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
- The logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options is incorrect.
- Incorrect removal of options and their arguments from `command.script_parts`.
- Incorrect extraction of the suggested command from `command.stderr`.

### Bug
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect removal of options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. In the provided buggy function, only one option is removed at a time, leading to potential errors when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present. Also, the extraction of the suggested command from `command.stderr` is incorrect, resulting in an incomplete output.

### Fix Strategy
The fix involves correctly handling both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, ensuring their proper removal from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the correct extraction of the suggested command from `command.stderr` is crucial for generating the new command accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove both --set-upstream and -u options and their arguments
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            argument_index = option_index + 1
            if argument_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(argument_index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their corresponding arguments from `command.script_parts`. It also accurately extracts the suggested command from `command.stderr`, leading to the generation of the new command as intended.
