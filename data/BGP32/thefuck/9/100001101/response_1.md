## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is intended to extract the correct upstream branch information from the error message produced by a failed git push command and then generate a new command without the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags. The bug in the function seems to be related to the incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list and the extraction of the `push_upstream` value.

## Bug Explanation
1. The function incorrectly tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` in the `command.script_parts` list and immediately replaces the value of `upstream_option_index` with the index of `-u` without considering the presence of `--set-upstream`.

2. If the upstream option is found (either `--set-upstream` or `-u`), the function attempts to pop two elements at the found index, which is not the correct way to remove the flag and its argument.

3. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` seems to be incorrect as it is slicing the string and partitioning based on 'git ' instead of extracting the actual upstream branch information.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function, we need to:
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately to find the correct indexes.
2. Remove the flag and its argument properly from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. Extract the correct upstream branch information from `command.stderr` to get the `push_upstream` value.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_flags = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for flag in upstream_flags:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split(' ', 1)[1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected function correctly handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, removes them and their arguments properly, and extracts the correct upstream branch information from the error message.
