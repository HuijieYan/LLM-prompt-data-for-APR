### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and its argument passed in and then concatenate the remaining command parts to suggest a new command. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable initialization is incorrect as it should be set to `-1` initially.
2. Removing the options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list in a loop is not implemented correctly.
3. The extracted `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` is incorrect as it includes the text "git" which is not desired.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function:
1. Initialize `upstream_option_index` with `-1`.
2. Find and remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments from `command.script_parts`.
3. Extract the correct `push_upstream` value without the unnecessary prefix "git".

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]  # Extract the correct value
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return new_command
``` 

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input cases and return the expected values as detailed in the cases provided.
