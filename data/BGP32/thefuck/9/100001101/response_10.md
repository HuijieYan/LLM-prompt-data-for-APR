The buggy function is not correctly identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags from the command script parts. The issue arises from not handling both flag cases appropriately when checking for their indices in the script parts.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle both flag cases in the buggy function. We should remove the respective flag and its argument from the script parts if found, and extract the correct push upstream command from the stderr. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

This corrected version properly handles both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags when removing them from the script parts, as well as accurately extracting the push upstream command from the stderr. This should now satisfy all the provided runtime and expected variable values for the failing test cases.
