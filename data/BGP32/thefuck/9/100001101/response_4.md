### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. The function is intended to remove these options and their arguments so that they are not included in the final command string. However, the function incorrectly removes these elements without considering the index of the found option, which leads to wrong results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in `command.script_parts` before removing them. This can be achieved by properly handling the results of the `index()` calls for both options and adjusting the removal logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments based on the correct index found in `command.script_parts`. This should address the bug and ensure that the function works as intended for all test cases.
