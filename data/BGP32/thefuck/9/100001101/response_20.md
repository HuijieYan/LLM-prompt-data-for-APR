The bug in the provided function is that the index of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is being updated incorrectly leading to potential removal of incorrect arguments from the command.

The buggy function attempts to find the index of "--set-upstream" or "-u" in the `command.script_parts` list and then removes these options from the command. However, the second try block overwrites the value obtained in the first try block, potentially causing an issue. Additionally, the code to remove the argument after finding the index is also incorrect as it pops twice, which can lead to removing incorrect arguments.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the index is found in the first try block before proceeding to the second try block. When removing the argument, it should only pop once to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option instead of popping twice which can lead to removing extra arguments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified and should now properly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command without removing any additional arguments.
