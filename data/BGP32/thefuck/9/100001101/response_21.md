The bug in the provided function lies in how the script is parsed to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The code only checks for one of the options and then proceeds to remove it, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure both options are checked and removed if found. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` variable needs to be corrected to ensure it captures the correct value from the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the correct push_upstream value from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the bug by properly handling both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and ensuring the correct extraction of the `push_upstream` value. This should result in the function correctly processing the input commands based on the provided test cases.
