### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `get_new_command` occurs because the code incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The buggy code only considers the last occurrence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and removes it, causing issues with the command reconstruction.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the handling of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The function incorrectly identifies the index of the option and then removes it from the list, but it doesn't handle the case where `-u` might be used instead of `--set-upstream`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` instances in the `command.script_parts` list. We should identify the index of both options separately and remove them from the list. Then, reconstruct the command without these options to get the desired output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in script_parts:
            index = script_parts.index(option)
            script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
            if index < len(script_parts):  # Check if argument is present
                script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function takes into account both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, removes them along with their arguments, reconstructs the command without these options, and returns the updated command. This version should now handle the cases correctly as per the expected input/output values provided.
