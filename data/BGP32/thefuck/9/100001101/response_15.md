### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to modify the `command` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present in the `command.script_parts` list. Then it extracts the suggested git command from the error message and replaces the `push` part in the original command with this suggestion using `replace_argument`.

#### Issues:
1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is flawed:
   - It uses two separate `try-except` blocks, which means if the first block doesn't find `--set-upstream`, the second block will always overwrite `upstream_option_index`.
   - When removing elements from the list using `pop`, it shifts the index of elements after the removed one which may cause incorrect removals.

2. The extraction of the suggested git command may not work as expected for all cases since it relies on the assumption that the suggestion is always in a specific position in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use a single `try-except` block to find both `--set-upstream` and `-u` indices.
2. Correctly remove the identified option by considering the new index after removing elements.
3. Improve the extraction of the suggested git command to ensure it works for all cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Correctly remove the option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Check if the suggestion exists, if not, use 'push' as fallback
    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version improves the logic to handle the removal of options correctly and provides a fallback in case the suggested git command is not found in the error message.
