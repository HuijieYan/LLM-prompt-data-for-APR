### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is that it tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument from the command script_parts list, but it incorrectly removes it twice due to popping at the same index twice. This affects the subsequent extraction of the push command from the stderr as it ends up being incorrectly extracted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should check for the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command script_parts and then remove it only once from the list. This will ensure that the subsequent extraction of the push command from the stderr is done correctly.

### Code Fix
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break  # Exit loop if option is found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
