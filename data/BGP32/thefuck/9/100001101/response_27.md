### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command provided. However, there are multiple issues with the current implementation:
1. The function only removes the first occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, without considering multiple occurrences.
2. There is an issue with populating the `push_upstream` variable correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the code to handle multiple occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` by iterating over the list of script parts and removing all instances.
2. Modify the code to correctly extract the `push_upstream` string by splitting the `command.stderr` based on newline character and selecting the correct index.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove all occurrences of --set-upstream or -u
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    script_parts = [part for part in script_parts if part != '--set-upstream' and part != '-u']

    # Extract push_upstream from command.stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
