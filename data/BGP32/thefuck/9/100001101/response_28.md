### Analysis
The function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command script parts and then construct a new command by replacing the 'push' word with the branch and its argument provided by the stderr. However, the code has a bug because it is not handling the index retrieval and removal correctly when there are multiple occurrences of the flag in the `command.script_parts`.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is overwritten with the index of `-u` irrespective of whether `--set-upstream` is found or not. This causes incorrect removal and then incorrect construction of the new command.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check for the existence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, remove them if found, and construct the new command with the correct branch information.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    upstream_option_index = None
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
