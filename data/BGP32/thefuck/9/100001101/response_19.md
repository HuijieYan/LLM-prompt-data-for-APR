### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to modify the git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument, then replacing the "push" command with the argument provided in the stderr message returned by git. 

The bug in the function is caused by not handling the case where both --set-upstream and -u flags are present. Additionally, the indexing logic for removing the flag and its argument is incorrect.

### Bug
The bug arises from the faulty logic when detecting and removing the --set-upstream or -u flags. If both flags are present, the function only removes one of them, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic to handle both --set-upstream and -u flags correctly.
2. Adjust the indexing logic to remove the flag and its argument properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument if it's a flag

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle both --set-upstream and -u flags and adjusting the indexing to remove the flag and its argument, the function should now work as intended for all cases.
