The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect indexing and removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command script parts. The script attempts to remove the option twice if found, leading to an incorrect modification of the input command.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that we remove the option only once if it exists in the script parts.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is removed only once if found in the script parts, avoiding the duplication of removal. This should now correctly handle the input command and produce the expected output in all the provided test cases.
