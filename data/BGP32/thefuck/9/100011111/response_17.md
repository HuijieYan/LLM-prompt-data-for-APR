### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command to push changes in a git repository by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, as this information is included in the message returned by the git command. The failing test is due to an IndexError when trying to pop an item from `command.script_parts` list that does not exist.

In the failing test, the `Command` object passed to the function includes the script parts `['git', 'push', '-u']`, which should result in the modified command `git push --set-upstream origin master`. However, the function encounters an IndexError while trying to pop the `-u` flag.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` flag from the `command.script_parts` list. The initial implementation uses two separate try-except blocks to search for the flags `'--set-upstream'` and `'-u'`, but when both flags are found, it leads to removing the same index twice. This causes the index to become out of range for the second pop operation.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to combine both searches for the flags and remove them together when found. Instead of multiple try-except blocks, we can use a single block to find both indices and remove them once. This way, we ensure that the index is only removed once even if both flags are present.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_flag_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    for index in upstream_flag_indices:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags only once, fixing the IndexError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
