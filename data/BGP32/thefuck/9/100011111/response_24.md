The bug occurs because the index removal process is repeated twice which leads to an `IndexError` when the `--set-upstream` option is missing in the `command.script_parts`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the code to only remove the options if they are found in `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove it twice to account for both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options may or may not be present in the `command.script_parts`.
