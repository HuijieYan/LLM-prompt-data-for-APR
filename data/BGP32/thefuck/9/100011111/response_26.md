### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle Git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument to reformat the push command. The bug is caused by populating the `upstream_option_index` incorrectly and trying to remove the argument twice. 

The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range`, which means that the function is trying to remove an element from a list using an index that is out of range.

### Bug:
The buggy function is improperly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command's arguments. In cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument are not present in the command, the script still tries to remove them, leading to the IndexError.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command's arguments.
2. Ensure that the option is only removed once from the arguments if found.
3. Handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present gracefully.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument if it exists
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command's arguments, ensuring that the index is within bounds and removing the argument only if it follows the option.
