The bug in the provided function is due to manipulating the `upstream_option_index` value incorrectly. The bug is triggered when the function tries to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags from the `command.script_parts` list by calling `pop` twice. However, if the flag is found at index `upstream_option_index`, it should only be removed once.

Additionally, the function incorrectly uses the `stderr` output to extract the suggested git command. The corrected version should check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags were present in the user input command and then construct the new command accordingly.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are present in the original command.
2. If found, remove the flag only once from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. Construct the new command by using the found flag and extracting the suggested git command from the `stderr` output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    suggested_command = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()  # Get the suggested git command from stderr
    return suggested_command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output for the given input cases.
