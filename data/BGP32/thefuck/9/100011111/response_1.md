The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of removing the upstream option "-u" or "--set-upstream" along with its argument. The buggy function removes the option at the wrong index, leading to an IndexError when trying to pop it again.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the upstream option and its argument and remove both elements from the command script parts. Additionally, we need to correctly extract the correct push upstream suggestion from the command stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option = None
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')        
        upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        upstream_option = '-u'
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    suggestion_line = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    push_upstream = suggestion_line.partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Ensure to replace the existing buggy function with the corrected one in the specified file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`. This fix should address the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
