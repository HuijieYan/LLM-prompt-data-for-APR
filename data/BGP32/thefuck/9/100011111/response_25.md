### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command and its argument if present, then extract the push command suggested by Git from the `stderr` of the command.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop the element at `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts`, causing an `IndexError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is trying to pop the element twice from `command.script_parts`, causing an `IndexError` when the index is already removed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to pop the element only once from `command.script_parts` at the correct index.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument once
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the logic to remove the argument only once from `command.script_parts`, we can avoid the `IndexError` and ensure the function works correctly for the given test cases.
