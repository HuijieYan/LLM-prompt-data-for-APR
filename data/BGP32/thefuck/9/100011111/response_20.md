### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as they are already included in the suggested git command.

The error occurs when trying to `pop` elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug arises from attempting to pop twice from the same index, which leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to `pop`.
2. If the option index is found, `pop` only once from that index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the function to only `pop` once from the index when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found, we avoid the IndexError. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
