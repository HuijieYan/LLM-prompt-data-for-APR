### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and returning a modified command with just the `push` part. The error message indicates an `IndexError` on trying to pop an element at an index that is out of range. The runtime input values show that the script parts of the command are being modified incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function tries to remove the upstream option and its argument from the script parts of the command. It incorrectly pops two elements when only one should be removed, leading to an out of range index error. This happens because the index is updated for `-u` after already removing the `--set-upstream` option, causing the removal to go out of bounds.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly remove only the relevant argument and its preceding option. This can be achieved by updating the upstream option index correctly and removing just those two elements from the script parts.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function correctly handles the removal of upstream options and arguments, ensuring that only the necessary elements are removed. This fix should address the issue observed in the failing test.
