### Analysis:
- The buggy function is designed to extract the git push suggestion provided in the `stderr` output and replace the `push` command with it in the input `command`.
- The error occurs due to the attempt to remove elements from the `script_parts` list using an index that might not exist.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the explanation that the pop index is out of range, which is happening due to the incorrect removal of elements.
- The bug causes the function to fail when dealing with cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is not present in the input `command`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index check before removing elements is correct to prevent the `IndexError`. Specifically, we must only remove elements if they actually exist in the list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if next element exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking the existence of the flag index and ensuring the next element exists before removing it from the list, the corrected function should handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are missing without causing an `IndexError`. This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and should address the reported GitHub issues.
