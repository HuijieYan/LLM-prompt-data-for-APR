### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to parse the error message from a failed `git push` command and extract the suggested command to set up the upstream branch. The bug occurs when the `-u` flag is present, resulting in an IndexError while trying to remove the passed option and its argument.

### Bug location
The issue lies in the removal of the `-u` flag and its argument within the script_parts list.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that when the `-u` option is present, the function removes it twice: once when the index of `--set-upstream` is found, and a second time when the `-u` index is found. This leads to removing elements from the `script_parts` list that are not valid indices, causing the IndexError.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of removing the given option and its argument. We should only remove the `-u` option once it is found, which will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case you provided.
