### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where the `git push` command is executed with the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. It aims to extract the suggested push command from the stderr message and replace the `-u` option with `--set-upstream`.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` that occurs when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts`. This issue arises when attempting to remove elements for the `'-u'` option that might not exist in certain cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing case where the input script parts are `['git', 'push', '-u']`, the function tries to pop elements at the index of `-1` (which is actually the last element) to remove the optional argument, leading to an `IndexError`. This error occurs because the index for the `'-u'` option is not correctly removed if found.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and have the function handle the `-u` option correctly, we need to ensure that both `'--set-upstream'` and `'-u'` options are properly handled. If either of them is found in the script parts, we should adjust the index accordingly for removing the option properly.

### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Then, extract the suggested push command from stderr and replace relevant argument.
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By incorporating the correction into the updated function above, the issue related to the `IndexError` when attempting to pop elements should be resolved. Now, the function should handle the `'-u'` option properly and provide the expected new command based on the stderr message.
