### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present and replacing the push destination with the one from the stderr message. The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`.

### Identified bug location
The bug is likely occurring when there are multiple occurrences of `-u` in the command script parts.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises because the code removes both occurrences of `--set-upstream` or `-u` by calling `pop` twice, but this leads to wrong indexing when trying to access elements that no longer exist in the list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, only one occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` should be removed from the `script_parts` array to prevent incorrect indexing for subsequent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### The corrected function explanation
In the corrected version of the function:
- We check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists in the list before trying to find their index.
- If found, we remove only one occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the list.
- This prevents incorrect indexing when accessing elements later on in the script.
- The rest of the function remains the same to reconstruct the corrected `git push` command.
