The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect handling of the pop operation for the `upstream_option_index`. The index is being removed twice without checking if it is valid, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop again. To fix this issue, we need to only pop the index once and update the `push_upstream` calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = 'origin'  # Updating push_upstream to handle all cases
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        push_upstream = command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function ensures that the `upstream_option_index` is only popped once if it exists, and correctly calculates the `push_upstream` value. It should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
