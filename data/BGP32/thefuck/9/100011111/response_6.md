### Analysis:
1. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command and then replace the `'push'` argument with the correct value extracted from the error message.
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` argument from the `command.script_parts` list if it exists. The issue arises from trying to remove the same index twice if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to trying to pop an index out of range, which happens when attempting to pop an already removed index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to only pop the index once for each instance of `-u` or `--set-upstream` present.
5. In the corrected function, we should ensure that the same index is not popped twice and rather handle both cases separately.
6. The corrected version should address these issues and pass the failing test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version ensures that the index is only popped once for each case of `-u` or `--set-upstream`. This should resolve the `IndexError` and handle the command parsing correctly for the provided test cases.
