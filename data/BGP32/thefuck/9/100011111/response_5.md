### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the git push command based on the given stderr message. The error occurs when the command includes the '-u' flag, as it tries to pop at the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`. The issue arises from removing the '--set-upstream' flag before checking if its index exists in the list. 

### Bug Cause
The bug stemmed from a logical flaw in handling the flags. The buggy function attempted to pop the index twice without handling the case where the `-u` flag is present. This caused the IndexError when trying to pop from an index that was removed earlier.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags before removing them from the command list.
2. Handle the case when either flag is found to avoid the IndexError.
3. Extract the updated command from stderr based on the message structure.

### Code Fix
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u flags are present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
        
    # Remove the flag and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'git':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # Extract the suggested command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Update the git push command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the function should now properly handle the removal of flags and provide the correct modified command based on the given stderr message.
