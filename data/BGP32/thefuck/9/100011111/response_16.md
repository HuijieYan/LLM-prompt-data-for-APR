The buggy function is failing due to an IndexError in the line where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called. This error occurs when `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 (default value) and then used in the pop function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to handle the case where `upstream_option_index` remains -1. We can achieve this by checking if `upstream_option_index` is greater than or equal to 0 before attempting to pop the script_parts list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this change, the function will now handle the case where `upstream_option_index` is -1 properly, avoiding the IndexError and allowing the function to run correctly for all the test cases provided.
