### Analysis:
- The buggy function is intended to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is used in a `git push` command and remove it from the command before suggesting a corrected version.
- The error occurs when trying to pop elements from the `script_parts` list based on the index of the detected flag, which can lead to an `IndexError` if the index is out of range.
- The failing test provides scenarios where the function fails to handle the `-u` flag correctly, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by attempting to pop elements from the `script_parts` list based on the index of the detected `-u` flag without checking if the index is valid.
- The issue arises when the `-u` flag is present, leading to an incorrect index that goes out of range when trying to pop elements.

### Fix Strategy:
- The strategy to fix the bug involves checking if the index obtained for either `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is within the valid range before attempting to remove elements from the list.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding a check to ensure that the index obtained from the flag detection is within a valid range before attempting to remove elements, we can address the `IndexError` issue. This corrected version should now handle the `-u` flag correctly and pass the failing test cases.
