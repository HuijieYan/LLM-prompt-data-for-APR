### Fixing the Bug
The bug in the current implementation arises from handling the removal of the '-u' option in the `command.script_parts` list. The buggy function is incorrectly trying to remove an element with index equal to `upstream_option_index` twice, which leads to an `IndexError`. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the index handling when removing the '-u' option.

#### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'git':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Testing the Fix
After applying the fix, the updated function should handle the removal of the '-u' option correctly without causing any IndexError. The tests should now pass for different scenarios of the input `command` as outlined above.

By making these changes, the function should now behave as expected, satisfying the required input/output values and successfully resolving the GitHub issue.
