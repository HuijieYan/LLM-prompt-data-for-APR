### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to process `git push` commands and modify them by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments if present. It then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr.
2. The error occurs when attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts` based on the `upstream_option_index` value. Since popping is attempted twice without checking the length of `command.script_parts`, it leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range.
3. The error message shows that the buggy function fails when processing a command with the `-u` option, as the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` raises the IndexError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check the length of `command.script_parts` before attempting to pop elements based on the `upstream_option_index`.
5. Adjust the logic to remove the specified argument and its associated option correctly without causing an IndexError.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding checks to ensure the index is within the bounds of `command.script_parts` before popping elements, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
