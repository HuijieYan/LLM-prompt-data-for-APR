### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is failing to handle the case where the `'-u'` flag is present in the `command.script_parts`. It is only looking for `upstream` options if they are passed as `'--set-upstream'`.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element at an index that is out of range.
3. The bug occurs because the function assumes that if `-u` flag is present, it will be at the same index as `'--set-upstream'`, which is incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check for the `-u` flag and appropriately update the command based on that.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if '-u' flag is present in the command
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        # Remove the '-u' flag
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # If '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are passed, remove them
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function now explicitly checks for the presence of `'-u'` in the `command.script_parts` and removes it if found.
2. It then checks for `'--set-upstream'` and removes it if present.
3. This approach ensures that both options are handled correctly, and the `IndexError` is resolved by safely removing elements from the list.
