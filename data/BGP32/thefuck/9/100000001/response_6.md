The buggy function is attempting to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command. The function then extracts the suggested branch name from the stderr of the command and replaces the argument in the modified command.

Here are the potential error locations and explanations for the bug:
1. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` should be `if upstream_option_index != -1` to correctly check for the presence of the option index.
2. The line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is popping the element at the same index twice (which is incorrect) instead of once. It should be `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` separately.
3. The index used to extract the branch name from `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` may not be a reliable way to get the branch name consistently. This may cause issues if the error message structure changes in the future.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified as follows to address the identified issues:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, the comparison condition is fixed, the duplicated pop operation is corrected, and a more reliable method is used to extract the branch name by splitting the string and getting the last element.
