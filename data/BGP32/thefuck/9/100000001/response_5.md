## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then replace the `push` command with the one suggested by git based on the `stderr` output. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to bugs.

## Identified Issues:
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is checked incorrectly for `-1`, it should be compared using `!=` instead of `is not`, as it is used as an index.
2. The logic to remove both the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is incorrect. Only one `pop` operation is required to remove both.
3. The index used to access `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` might cause indexing errors if the length of the split result is less than 3.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect indexing and handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable, leading to either not removing the options correctly or potential index out of range errors when accessing elements of the split `stderr`.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the conditional check for `upstream_option_index`.
2. Update the logic to remove the option and its argument correctly.
3. Add a check for the length of `command.stderr.split('\n')` to avoid index out of range errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument too
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument too

    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    suggested_command_index = -3 if len(stderr_parts) >= 3 else -1
    push_upstream = stderr_parts[suggested_command_index].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is separated. If either is found, the option and its argument are removed correctly. Also, a check is added to ensure the length of `stderr_parts` is sufficient before accessing the `-3` index to avoid errors.
