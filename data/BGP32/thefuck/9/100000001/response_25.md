The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to process a command in the context of a git push operation. The function aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command, as these options are already included in the suggested git command. It then extracts the upstream branch from the stderr output of the original command and replaces the push argument with it.

There are two potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument by popping elements from `command.script_parts` may lead to incorrect results. If both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present, only one of them would be removed, which could cause issues.
2. The way the upstream branch is extracted from `command.stderr` may not be reliable if the format of the stderr output changes.

The bug in the function is caused by incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument. It tries to remove the flag and argument separately, but the removal logic is flawed when both flags are present.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to iterate over `command.script_parts` to find and remove both the flag and its argument simultaneously using their index. Additionally, a more robust method should be used to extract the upstream branch from the stderr output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if flag in command.script_parts:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
            if flag_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)

    push_upstream = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In this corrected version, both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments are removed by finding their indices in `command.script_parts` and popping them simultaneously. The upstream branch is extracted from the stderr output in a more robust manner by looking for the line containing 'git'. If a valid upstream branch is found, it is used to replace the push argument in the command.
