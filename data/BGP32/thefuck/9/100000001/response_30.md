The buggy function is trying to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. It then extracts the suggested command from the stderr and replaces the push argument with the extracted one.

There are potential error locations in the code:
1. The usage of `upstream_option_index` as a flag to determine if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present may not work correctly.
2. The pop operation to remove the option and its argument may lead to index out of bounds error if the option is not found.
3. Extracting the push command from the stderr may not work as expected if the stderr format changes.

The bug is caused by not handling the case where the upstream option is not found correctly. The code tries to pop the option and its argument even if it's not present, potentially leading to an IndexError.

To fix the bug, a more robust approach would be to check if either of the options is present, and then safely remove both the option and its argument. Additionally, ensure that the error handling when extracting the push command from stderr is more robust.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    if len(command.stderr.split('\n')) >= 3:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version handles the case when the upstream option is not found, ensuring that the index is within bounds when attempting to pop the option and its argument. It also includes better error handling when extracting the push command from stderr.
