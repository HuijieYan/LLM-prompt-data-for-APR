## Analysis:
This buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case when `git push` returns an error message that suggests using the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag. The function tries to extract the suggested command from the error message and replace the original `git push` command with this new suggested command.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `command.script_parts.index` might cause an issue if the flag '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not present in the command. In such cases, an exception is raised, but the code does not handle it properly.
2. The index positions are not adjusted when removing elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are not present in the command. In such cases, the function does not handle the exceptions properly, leading to potential errors or incorrect output.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using `command.script_parts.index`, we can iterate through the `command.script_parts` list and check for the presence of the flags '--set-upstream' or '-u'.
2. When removing elements from the `command.script_parts` list, adjust the index positions accordingly to ensure correct modifications.
3. Handle the case when the flags are not present in the command to prevent potential errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags in the command
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            upstream_option_index = i
            break
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument from the command
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the suggested command from the error message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the 'push' argument in the original command with the suggested command
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return new_command
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the cases where the flags are not present in the command and adjust the index positions properly when modifying the `command.script_parts` list.
