The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the git command, as these are included by default in the git command suggested by git. The function then extracts the remote branch name from the stderr output of the git command and replaces the local branch name in the original command with the remote branch name.

The bug in the current function lies in the way the `upstream_option_index` is being handled. The function is using two separate try blocks to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and then overwriting the initial index if the second try block is executed. This results in missing the correct index when both options are present. Additionally, when removing the options, the second `pop` call is using the same index as the first one, causing the function to only remove one of the two elements.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the scenario where both options are present and ensure that both the option and its argument are removed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove option
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We are using a loop to iterate over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options to properly handle the case when both are present.
2. We remove both the option and its argument using the correct indices.
3. The function will now handle both options correctly and remove them along with their arguments before replacing the branch name in the original command.
