The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts and then generate a new command based on the remaining parts. The bug in this function lies in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable and how it is checked for removal.

### Issue:
1. The variables `upstream_option_index` are being overwritten if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags are present in the command script parts. This may lead to incorrect removal.
2. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` will always evaluate to `True` as `-1` is interpreted as `True` in Python, so the code inside this condition always executes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using two separate `try-except` blocks, combine them into a single block to handle both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags.
2. Use a proper comparison for checking the correct index value of `upstream_option_index`.
3. Remove the elements from the `command.script_parts` list correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the code now properly handles the removal of both `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags and their arguments from `command.script_parts` based on the detected indices. After fixing these issues, the function should work correctly.
