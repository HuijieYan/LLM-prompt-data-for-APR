The buggy function provided seems to be attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from a git push command and replace them with the correct push upstream suggestion.

Potential Errors:
1. The code assumes that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list, but it does not check if they exist before trying to access their index.
2. When removing the options from the `command.script_parts` list, the function is popping two elements at the same index, which could lead to an index out of range error.

Cause of Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the assumption that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options will always be present in the list of script parts, leading to potential errors when trying to access indexes that may not exist or removing elements incorrectly.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the options (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) exist in the list before trying to access their index.
2. Replace the incorrect removal of elements by properly handling the removal of one element at the respective index.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We check if the `--set-upstream` option exists in the list first, and if it does, we remove it.
- If not, we check for the `-u` option and remove it if found.
- We then proceed with extracting the correct push upstream suggestion and returning the new command.
