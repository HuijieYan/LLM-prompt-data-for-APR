## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify the git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument if present, and replacing the argument of the push command. The bug in the function is related to handling the index of the upstream option.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The incorrect handling of the index for the upstream option.
2. Removing the wrong index from the command.script_parts list.
3. Accessing elements of command.stderr without proper error handling.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic to find the index of --set-upstream or -u in the script_parts is incorrect. The code mistakenly removes the same index twice when either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found in the command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' separately and remove it only once.
2. Handle errors gracefully when accessing elements of the command.stderr to avoid potential exceptions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version:
- The index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found separately and removed only once from the command.script_parts list.
- Errors are handled by checking for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' before accessing their index.
- The logic for removing the upstream option has been fixed to prevent duplicates.
