## Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the input command passed to it.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is being updated and checked.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of the index for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag, leading to potential errors in removing them from the command.
4. We need to ensure that the handling of `upstream_option_index` is done correctly to remove the specified flag and its argument.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately in order to accurately find their indices.
2. Ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is properly updated when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found.
3. After identifying the correct index, remove the flag and its argument from the `script_parts` list.
4. Handle cases where the flag might not be found to avoid errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should accurately handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments from the input command.
