The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to manipulate the command for pushing changes in a git repository. However, there are several potential errors that could cause issues:
1. The check for `-u` flag to determine the `upstream_option_index` can overwrite the value set by `--set-upstream`, leading to incorrect deletion of the argument.
2. The `pop` method is used twice in succession on the `command.script_parts`, which can lead to incorrect manipulation of the command arguments if the `upstream_option_index` is not properly updated after the first removal.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the logic for determining `upstream_option_index` to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags.
2. Adjust the deletion of elements in the `command.script_parts` list to properly account for removing the correct argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u flags
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Correct the index for the second pop operation
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is detected and properly used for deleting arguments in `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we adjust the second `pop` operation to consider the length of the list after the first removal. This will fix the bug and correctly manipulate the git push command as intended.
