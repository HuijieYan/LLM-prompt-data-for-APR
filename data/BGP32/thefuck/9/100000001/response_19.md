## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify the command by removing the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments before returning the corrected command with the push command. However, there are some issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The code uses `command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')` and `command.script_parts.index('-u')` to find the index of the upstream options. If the first option is not found, it attempts to find the second option, but the index might not be updated correctly.
2. The handling of `upstream_option_index` could be improved to ensure proper removal of both the option and its argument.
3. The usage of `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` might not always provide the correct output when extracting the push command.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The implementation of updating `upstream_option_index` and removing elements from `command.script_parts` is not done correctly, leading to potential errors in the final output command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the index retrieval and removal of the upstream option and its argument.
2. Ensure that the extraction of the push command from `command.stderr` is more reliable and accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if command.script_parts.index('-u') < upstream_option_index:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We update `upstream_option_index` by checking if the second form of the option appears before the first one.
2. Properly remove both the option and its argument by considering the length of `command.script_parts`.
3. Adjust the index for selecting the correct line from `command.stderr` to extract the push command.

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should provide the intended behavior of removing the upstream option and its argument before constructing the new command.
