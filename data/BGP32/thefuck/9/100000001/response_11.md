## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts, since these options will already be included in the suggested git command. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The index of the `-u` option is checked regardless of whether the `--set-upstream` option is found. This can lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The removal of the `-u` option and its argument is incorrect as it removes the element at the same index twice. 
3. The retrieval of the pushed upstream reference from the command's stderr is not robust and might fail in certain cases.

## Bug:
The bug in the function stems from how the `upstream_option_index` is updated and used. If the `--set-upstream` option is not found, the index for `-u` is updated to a non-negative value. Due to this logic, if `-u` is not found, the index becomes a non-negative value, leading to unintended removals from the script parts. Moreover, the removal of the option and its argument is incorrect, as it removes the element at the same index twice.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options is correct and that the indexing and removal of elements from the script parts list are done properly. Additionally, the retrieval of the pushed upstream reference from the stderr needs to be made more robust.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the --set-upstream option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument
        
    # If --set-upstream is not found, check for -u option
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the -u option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first check for `--set-upstream` and handle it appropriately. If it is not found, we then check for the `-u` option. It ensures correct indexing and removal of elements from the `script_parts` list. Additionally, consider adding error handling for the extraction of the pushed upstream reference to make the function more robust.
