## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the input `command` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. After that, it extracts a command from the `stderr` message to replace the `push` command in the modified `command`.
2. The potential error locations are in the indexing of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, popping elements from `script_parts`, and extracting the push command from `stderr`.
3. The bug in the current function is that if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command`, only the last one found will be removed, and the `script_parts` list will be left with incorrect size. Additionally, the extraction of the push command from `stderr` might not work as expected if the `stderr` message structure changes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, ensure proper removal of elements from `script_parts`, and handle the extraction of the push command more robustly.

## Correction:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return None  # Return None if stderr lines not enough

```

In the corrected version:
- We iterate over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options to ensure both are removed if present.
- We handle the extraction of the push command from `stderr` more robustly by checking the length of `stderr` lines before processing the extraction.
- We return `None` if the `stderr` lines are not enough to extract the push command effectively.
