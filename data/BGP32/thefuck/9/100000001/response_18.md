### Analysis of the Buggy Function:
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It then extracts the upstream branch information from the `stderr` of the `command` object and constructs a new command using `replace_argument`.

### Potential Errors in the Buggy Function:
1. The handling of finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options might not be accurate.
2. Accessing the third last line of `stderr` without proper error checking might lead to IndexErrors.
3. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` and `-u` arguments may not work as expected.

### Causes of the Bug:
1. The use of two consecutive `try-except` blocks for finding the index of options overwrites the `upstream_option_index` variable.
2. The indexing for accessing the third last line of `stderr` may throw an `IndexError` if the `stderr` has fewer lines than expected.
3. The logic to remove the options and their arguments might not consider all the potential cases correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a single `try-except` block for both options and set the index once found.
2. Check for the length of the `stderr` before accessing the third last line to avoid `IndexError`.
3. Ensure that the removal of options and their arguments handles all cases, including the removal of only the argument.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return command.script

```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function now correctly handles finding the index of options, accessing `stderr` lines safely, and removing the options and arguments. By following the suggested strategy and fixes, the function should now work as intended without the bugs present in the original implementation.
