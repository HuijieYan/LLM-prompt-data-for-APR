## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command, and then replace the argument of the `push` command with the upstream branch suggested by git.

## Identified Bug:
1. The bug is in the logic that removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments. The bug arises because the code removes the arguments at `upstream_option_index` twice, leading to an incorrect removal of arguments.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the code pops the element at `upstream_option_index` twice if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are found, leading to removing the same argument multiple times.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. We should only pop the element once when the option is found.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) else None
        elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) else None
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, I added conditions to check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them. Additionally, I added a check to ensure that we only pop elements if the index is within the bounds of the list. This way, we ensure that we remove the options and their arguments correctly without encountering the bug of removing the same argument multiple times.
