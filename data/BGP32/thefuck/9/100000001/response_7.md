### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command based on certain conditions, specifically related to the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
2. The function tries to find the index of these options in the `command.script_parts` list, but there are logical issues in how it handles them.
3. The buggy behavior seems to be related to how the function handles finding the indices of the upstream options and removing them from the `command.script_parts` list.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve correctly identifying and removing the specified options from the list of script parts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the logic for handling the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options by addressing the assignment of `upstream_option_index`.
2. Added a condition to check `upstream_option_index` correctly to remove the specified options from `command.script_parts`.
3. No other major changes were made, as the primary issue was related to handling the upstream options.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly identify and remove the upstream options before returning the modified command.
