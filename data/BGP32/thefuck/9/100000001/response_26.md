## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options along with their arguments from the command script parts. It then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr output of the original command and replaces the 'push' argument with this new push command.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is initialized to -1 but should be initialized to None as -1 is a valid index in Python.
2. The logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments is incorrect as it will only remove the last occurrence of either option, not both.
3. There is an indexing issue when accessing `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` as it may raise an error if there are not enough lines in the stderr output.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function lies in the incorrect handling of removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments. Additionally, there is a risk of an error when trying to access `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` if there are not enough lines in the stderr output.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Initialize `upstream_option_index` to `None` instead of -1.
2. Properly handle the removal of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options along with their arguments.
3. Handle potential errors when accessing `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Initialize upstream_option_index to None
    upstream_option_index = None
    
    # Remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options along with their arguments
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Handle potential index error when accessing stderr
    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    except IndexError:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
``` 

In this corrected version:
1. `upstream_option_index` is initialized to `None`.
2. Both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options along with their arguments will be properly removed.
3. Potential IndexError is handled when accessing `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]`.
