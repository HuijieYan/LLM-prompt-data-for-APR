The buggy function has several potential error locations that could cause unexpected behavior:
1. The variable `upstream_option_index` is initialized as -1, which is not a valid index in a list. This could lead to index out of range errors when trying to access elements in the list `command.script_parts`.
2. The logic for removing the upstream option and its argument is incorrect. The code removes both the option and its argument, which can cause issues with re-ordering the remaining command parts later.

The bug in this function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of removing the upstream option and its argument. The function should only remove the option and its corresponding argument rather than removing both occurrences.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly check for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and handle each case separately.
2. Remove the correct index when removing the upstream option and its argument.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle the remaining command parts after removing the upstream option.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' are passed, and remove them and their arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The fixed function correctly handles the removal of the upstream option and its argument, ensuring that only the specific option and its corresponding argument are removed.
