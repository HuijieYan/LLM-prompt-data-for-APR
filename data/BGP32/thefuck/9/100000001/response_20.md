## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and replacing the push command with the suggested git command provided in the stderr. The function attempts to find the index of the --set-upstream or -u option in the command's script parts, remove them, and then extract the suggested command from the stderr.

## Potential Errors:
1. The handling of finding the index of --set-upstream and -u separately could lead to issues.
2. Mistake in popping elements twice if the option is found.
3. Using the wrong index to extract the suggested command from stderr.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to find and remove the --set-upstream or -u options independently, leading to potential issues with the index manipulation and removal process. Additionally, the index used to extract the suggested command from stderr might not be accurate.

## Strategy for Fixing:
1. Correctly handle the search for both --set-upstream and -u options.
2. Ensure that elements are popped only once if the option is found.
3. Verify the correct index to extract the suggested command from stderr.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u option, if present
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument if found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
- We handle the search for both --set-upstream and -u options using if-elif conditions.
- Ensure elements are popped only once if the option is found.
- Revised the extraction process for the suggested command from stderr.
