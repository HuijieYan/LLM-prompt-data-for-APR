### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to manipulate the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present, and then replacing the `push` command with the actual suggested command from the error message.
   
2. The bug arises from the logic used to remove the options and their arguments. When the `-u` option is present, it is correctly identified at index 2. However, it attempts to pop twice at the same index, causing an `IndexError` because the second pop tries to access an index out of range.
   
3. The failing tests assert specific expected outcomes of the corrected command after manipulation, but the buggy function fails to provide the correct output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the `-u` option and ensure that only one pop operation is performed. Additionally, we should update the command script with the suggested `push` command based on the error message provided.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After correcting the function as above, it should pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected output based on the provided arguments and the error message.
