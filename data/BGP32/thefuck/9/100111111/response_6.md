### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options if present, as this part is concatenated onto the suggested git command.
2. The bug is caused by an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` elements from `command.script_parts` based on the `upstream_option_index`.
3. In the failing test, when the `git push -u` command is passed, the script_parts are `['git', 'push', '-u']`, and the function fails due to this situation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we handle the removal of `-u` option correctly and also validate the index value before attempting to pop the elements from the list.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them directly. This approach avoids the `IndexError` that occurred due to incorrect handling of pop operations.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle the scenarios mentioned in the GitHub issue.
