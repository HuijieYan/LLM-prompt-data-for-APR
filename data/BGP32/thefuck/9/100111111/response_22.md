To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to adjust the logic for identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments correctly. The current implementation does not consider the case where there are additional arguments following the `-u` option.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # If the option is found, remove it along with its argument
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested push command from the error message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Return the new command with corrected arguments
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this revised implementation, the function will correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments even if there are additional arguments following them. This should resolve the issue of the failing tests.

The corrected function considers the possibility of additional arguments following the `-u` option and deletes both the option and its subsequent argument if they exist. Then, it properly extracts the suggested push command from the error message and constructs the new command accordingly.

After applying this fix, the test cases should pass successfully, matching the expected input/output values provided.
