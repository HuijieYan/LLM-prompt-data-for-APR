The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements that do not exist in the `command.script_parts` list. This issue is due to the logic of handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The function is currently trying to pop twice from the same index, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that we only pop once from the identified index if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the command. Additionally, we need to correctly extract the new `push_upstream` value from the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the options properly without causing an `IndexError`. It should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
