## Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the input command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their corresponding values from the `script_parts`. It then extracts the suggested push command from the last line of command.stderr and replaces the 'push' command in the modified script_parts with this suggestion.
2. The bug occurs when trying to pop the same index from `command.script_parts` multiple times consecutively. This leads to an `IndexError` due to the index going out of range.
3. The failing test case for `-u` flag triggers the bug because the index for `-u` is popping the same index twice consecutively, leading to an out-of-range index error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove the element at the index correctly and handle the case where the index may change if popped.
5. The bug is reported in GitHub issue #538, and fixing it will resolve suggestions for `git push -u myfork`.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function to address the bug:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) and command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'push':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes a fix to handle the case where the same index is popped twice consecutively. It checks if the index exists before popping and ensures that the subsequent index corresponds to the 'push' command before popping it.

With this fix, the function should now handle the `-u` flag correctly, and the failing test case should pass as expected.
