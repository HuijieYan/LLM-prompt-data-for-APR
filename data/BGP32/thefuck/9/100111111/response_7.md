## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command()` is designed to modify the input command for a git push operation. It aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the input command and its argument. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of the indices related to these options and arguments within the command.

1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is not correctly updating with the index of the options. There is an issue with the logic when checking for `-u` since it can override the value set by `--set-upstream`.
2. The use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is not correct. This operation erroneously tries to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option which can lead to an `IndexError`.

The failing test case involves a scenario where the command includes the `-u` option, and the bug causes an index out of range error while trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.

## Solution
To fix the bug, the logic for finding the correct index of the options (`-u` and `--set-upstream`) needs to be revised. Additionally, the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` needs to be adjusted to prevent index out of range errors.

I will refactor the logic to loop through the script parts to find and remove the options and their arguments properly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    to_remove = []
    for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            to_remove.extend((idx, idx + 1))

    new_command_parts = [part for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if idx not in to_remove]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the new logic iterates over the script parts to identify the indices of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their arguments, then removes them correctly without causing index out of range errors. This revised version should address the bug and make the function work correctly for the provided failing test cases.
