## Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify the Git command passed as input, specifically to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their respective arguments.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the index of `-u`. This results in an `IndexError` due to a miscalculation of the index position, causing the function to fail the test cases.
3. When examining the failing test and the error message, we see that the function fails when the `-u` option is present in the input command with a branch argument.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to consider the correct index of the option to remove from the list of script parts accurately.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the correct index of the `-u` option is identified and removed along with its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately identify and remove the `-u` option and its argument, resolving the `IndexError` and passing the failing test cases.
