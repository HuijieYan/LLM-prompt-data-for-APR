The bug in the function `get_new_command` arises from the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` when popping elements from the `command.script_parts`. The function mistakenly tries to pop the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when that index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for removing the upstream option and its argument from `command.script_parts` to ensure it handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # The remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove both the option and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the argument can be popped
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle the removal of the upstream option and its corresponding argument correctly, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring due to the incorrect popping of elements.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
