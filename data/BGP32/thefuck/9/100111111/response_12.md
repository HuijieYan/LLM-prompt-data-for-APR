## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `get_new_command` in `git_push.py`. It aims to handle the `git push` command and modify it as needed based on the `stderr` output received.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect index handling when trying to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command.
3. The bug causes an `IndexError` when attempting to remove an item from the list that does not exist.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if the index is valid before attempting to remove the item from the list.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking if the item exists in `command.script_parts` before attempting to get its index, we ensure that the index will be valid when trying to remove the item. This correction should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function behave as expected in all test cases.
