The issue in the buggy function lies in the way it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the list of script parts. The current implementation performs the removal twice, leading to an 'IndexError' when attempting to pop an element that does not exist.

To fix this issue, we need to correct the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the list of script parts.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the 'IndexError' due to popping an element out of range issue should be resolved. The function should now correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument.

Make sure to test the function thoroughly to ensure that it now passes all the test cases provided.
