The bug in the `get_new_command` function stems from how the upstream option index is handled. The code incorrectly tries to remove the option twice for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop an index that is out of range.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the unnecessary extra pop operation. We only need to pop the index once for either `--set-upstream` or `-u` if it exists. Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if it exists, without causing an `IndexError`. It should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
