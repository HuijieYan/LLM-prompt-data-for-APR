The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts`, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument from the command, as these options are already included in the push suggestion by Git.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the index if it exists in the list `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This correction checks if the index for `-u` or `--set-upstream` is within the range of the list before trying to pop it. If the index is valid, it removes the option and its argument correctly.

The revised function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output specified.
