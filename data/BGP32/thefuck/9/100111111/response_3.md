### Analysis
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `command` object based on specific conditions related to the git push command.
- The main issue arises from the indexing logic when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.
- The `push_upstream` variable is also incorrectly calculated by extracting the last line of `command.stderr` and assuming the git command suggested is always in a specific format.
- The failing test cases highlight the incorrect outputs from the buggy function due to the index out of range error.

### Bug Explanation
- The key issue is in the pop operation on `command.script_parts`, which is flawed in handling the indexes, leading to an IndexError in scenarios where the index is out of range.
- As per the failing test cases, the buggy function does not correctly process and modify the `command` object based on the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
- The `push_upstream` variable's extraction from `command.stderr` is also problematic as it might not always follow the assumed format, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Revise the logic for removing `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from `command.script_parts` to avoid index out of range errors.
2. Improve the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` to handle various formats and ensure correct output generation.
3. Refactor the conditional logic for modifying the `command` object to align with the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    push_upstream = ' '.join(command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[2:])
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream) if push_upstream else None
```

This corrected version adjusts the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from `command.script_parts` correctly and extracts `push_upstream` in a more flexible manner. It also handles cases where `push_upstream` might not be extracted, returning `None` in such scenarios.
