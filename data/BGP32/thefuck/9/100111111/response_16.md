The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when trying to access an element from `command.script_parts` with an index that is out of range. This error occurs because the code attempts to pop elements twice if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is in the script_parts list, leading to an index error.

To fix this bug and address the failing test, we should ensure that the pop operation is performed only once for the identified `upstream_option_index`. Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will only pop the element at `upstream_option_index` once, resolving the index error and ensuring that the function behaves as expected based on the provided failing tests.

This fix addresses the reported GitHub issue as well, providing accurate suggestions for `git push -u myfork` cases.
