The buggy function is failing because it is trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list at an index that is out of range. This results in an `IndexError`. The root cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the existence of two consecutive elements when popping, but in cases where only one element exists after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, the second pop attempt results in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the element once when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. We can achieve this by modifying the if condition that checks for the presence of the option.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle cases where only one element is left in `command.script_parts` after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
