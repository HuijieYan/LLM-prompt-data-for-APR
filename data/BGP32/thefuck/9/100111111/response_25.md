To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the `IndexError` that occurs when trying to pop the option index that has already been removed. The root cause of the issue is that the function is attempting to remove an item from the list `command.script_parts` twice if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present.

To resolve the bug, we should update the code to remove the option index only once. We can achieve this by updating the logic to handle both flags in a single `try-except` block. If one of the flags is found, we can remove it, and then proceed with obtaining the `push_upstream` value as before.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument if present
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This correction should address the `IndexError` issue and ensure that the function processes both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly. The function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
