To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to correct the logic for handling the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The error is due to incorrect handling of the indexes when removing these options from the command script parts. The correct approach should be to remove the option and its corresponding argument while considering the multiple cases of the options being present.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        arg_index = upstream_option_index + 1
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
        arg_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            arg_index = upstream_option_index + 1
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if arg_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(arg_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the cases where `-u` or `--set-upstream` options are present, remove them along with their arguments, and generate the new command as expected. This updated version should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.

The bug fix corresponds to the GitHub issue:
- Issue title: `#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions`
- Detailed description: The bug fix addresses the incorrect suggestions for `git push -u <remote>` scenario, making sure the correct command is generated without errors.
