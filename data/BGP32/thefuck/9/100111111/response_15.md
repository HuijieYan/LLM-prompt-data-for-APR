The issue in the buggy function is related to removing the `-u` option and its argument. The error message states that an `IndexError` occurs when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list. This error is caused by trying to pop the same index twice, leading to the second pop operation being out of bounds. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of handling the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. Instead of trying to pop the same index twice, we should adjust how we remove these options and arguments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if -u or --set-upstream option is present
    has_upstream_option = False
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        has_upstream_option = True
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        has_upstream_option = True

    # Fetch the push upstream suggestion
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Construct the new command with the upstream suggestion
    if has_upstream_option:
        return f"git {' '.join(command.script_parts)} {push_upstream}"
    else:
        return f"git {' '.join(command.script_parts)} --set-upstream {push_upstream}"
```

This corrected version will correctly handle the removal of the options and concatenate the remaining script parts with the push upstream suggestion. This should resolve the `IndexError` issue and make the function work as expected.
