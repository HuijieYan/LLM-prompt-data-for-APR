### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle the git push commands and manipulate them accordingly by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments.
2. The function is currently failing due to an `IndexError` when attempting to `pop` elements from `command.script_parts`.
3. The failing test cases include various scenarios of git push commands with different flags and arguments.
4. The bug seems to be related to not correctly handling the removal of the flags and their arguments, leading to inconsistencies in the output.
5. The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights the incorrect behavior observed when suggesting corrected git push commands.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` while trying to eliminate the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` is done correctly which involves correctly adjusting the index when removing the elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove either --set-upstream or -u and their argument from the command parts
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Adjust the index after the removal
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the adjustment to remove the elements correctly and considering proper index handling, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and provide accurate command suggestions for git push commands.
