Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test, we can identify the following issues:
- The function is trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if the element exists, leading to an `IndexError` when popping.
- The function is not properly handling the case when `'-u'` flag is present in the command.

To fix this bug, a strategy could involve:
1. Checking if the `'-u'` flag is present in the `command.script_parts` list and using that information to handle the upstream option correctly.
2. Only pop the element if it actually exists in the list to avoid `IndexError`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Handling the cases when '-u' flag is present in the script_parts
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument if it exists
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the cases where `'-u'` flag is present and avoid the `IndexError` when trying to pop elements that do not exist in the list. It should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
