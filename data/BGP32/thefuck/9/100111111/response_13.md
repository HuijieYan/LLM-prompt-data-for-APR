### Analysis
1. The buggy function aims to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` option if present and then replacing the `push` argument with the actual target to push to. 
2. The bug occurs due to popping the same index from `command.script_parts` twice, leading to an IndexError.
3. The failing test reveals that the function fails when the `-u` option is present in the input command. The error occurs due to incorrect removal of arguments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options correctly while considering potential index errors.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ('--set-upstream', '-u')]
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        if (index + 1) < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By considering all indices where either '--set-upstream' or '-u' occur, we can avoid the IndexError and correctly modify the command as intended. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the reported GitHub issue.
