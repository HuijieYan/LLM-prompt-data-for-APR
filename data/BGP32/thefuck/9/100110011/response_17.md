### Analysis:
The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle the case where the user types `git push -u` and then encounters an error message because the current branch lacks an upstream branch. The function aims to suggest the correct command with `--set-upstream` instead of `-u`. However, it fails to do so due to an error that causes an `IndexError`.

### Identified Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when the script_parts list is modified by popping an element, the index positions of the remaining elements shift. Therefore, the second pop operation causes an `IndexError` because the index has already been shifted beyond the length of the list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove both occurrences of the element at the `upstream_option_index`. This can be done by ensuring that the second pop operation only occurs if the index is still within the bounds of the list. Alternatively, both pops can be combined into a single operation, removing the element at the specified index only once.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the function should handle the `git push -u` suggestion correctly and pass the failing test case. This correction addresses the IndexError by ensuring that the second pop operation is executed only if the index is still within the valid range of the list.
