### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` flag and its argument if present, then replacing the 'push' argument with the correct upstream as suggested by git.
2. The potential error locations in the function are the parts where it tries to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The cause of the bug is an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an element from an empty list (when the upstream options are not present in the `command.script_parts` list).
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the index of the upstream option is valid before trying to pop elements from the list.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' is in the script parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    # If upstream options found, remove them
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check valid index
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct push upstream from git stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By performing the index validity check in the corrected version, we prevent the `IndexError` that was causing the failure in the test cases. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases.
