### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the `git push` command by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments if present, and then replace the `push` command with the actual remote and branch discovered from the stderr message.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop an item from `command.script_parts` at the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test cases expect the `git push` command to be modified correctly with the remote and branch, which is not happening due to the bug in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove the found index only once and adjust the replacement logic to include the correct remote and branch.
5. The corrected version of the function will address the issue by handling the `IndexError` and extracting the correct remote and branch from the stderr message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` call to prevent the `IndexError`.
2. Extract the correct remote and branch values from the stderr message to replace the argument in the `git push` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately modify the `git push` command by removing unnecessary flags and arguments, and replacing the push command with the correct remote and branch extracted from the stderr message. This should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
