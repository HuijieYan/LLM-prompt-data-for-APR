### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a command for git push by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing the `push` part of the command with information extracted from the git error message. However, there are issues with the indexing when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. 

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, the code mistakenly tries to `pop` twice using the same index, which results in the `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. One potential approach is to only pop the index once after identifying it.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By applying this correction, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
