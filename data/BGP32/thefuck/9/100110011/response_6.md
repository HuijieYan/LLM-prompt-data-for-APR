### Analyzing the Bug:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to process the given `git push` command by modifying the arguments appropriately. It aims to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` if present in the command and then construct a new command based on the last error message returned by Git.
2. The failing test cases indicate that when the command contains `-u` option, the function encounters an `IndexError` while attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way `upstream_option_index` is checked might cause issues.
2. The pop operation on `command.script_parts` may result in an `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the fact that after the initial check for `--set-upstream`, the code searches for `-u` without resetting `upstream_option_index`. This causes the function to incorrectly assume the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream`, leading to out-of-range popping.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we should handle the cases of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately. If `-u` is found, it should remove it and the following argument properly. After that, the function should parse the desired argument from the error message to construct the new command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Handle --set-upstream
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    # Handle -u
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By incorporating the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the different scenarios involving `-u` and `--set-upstream` options in the `git push` command, resolving the `IndexError` that was previously encountered.
