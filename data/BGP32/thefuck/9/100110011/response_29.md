### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to adjust the git push command based on the error message received. It looks for `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the script parts and removes them, then extracts the suggested command from the error message and replaces the arguments in the original command with the extracted suggestion.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop an index out of range in the script_parts list of the Command object.
3. The failing test with error message emphasizes that the pop index is out of range due to the attempt to pop the same index twice.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the upstream_option_index is checked for as a valid index before attempting the pop operation.
5. Based on the above analysis, a corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking if the upstream_option_index is not equal to -1 and if it is within the range of script_parts before popping it again, we avoid the index out of range error. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test provided.
