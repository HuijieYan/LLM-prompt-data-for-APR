### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present in the command and its argument, and then replacing the argument following `push` with the correct argument provided in the `stderr`. The bug causing the Index Error is due to popping the same index twice if the flag is found in the command.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following lines:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
In the above lines, the same index `upstream_option_index` is popped twice, causing the `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by popping the same index twice in the code. When the flag is found, it is removed once correctly, but then attempting to remove it again at the same index leads to an `IndexError` because the size of `script_parts` decreases after the first `pop`.

### Fix Strategy:
One strategy to fix this bug is to remove the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list only once, ensuring that each index is popped only once to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the flag and its argument are removed from `script_parts` only once, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
