### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replacing the 'push' argument with the argument extracted from the provided `stderr`. The function seems to have an issue with handling the removal of the option and its argument correctly.

The failing test in `test_git_push.py` demonstrates the failure of the function to properly handle the `-u` option. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to attempting to pop an index that does not exist in the `command.script_parts` list.

The GitHub issue #538 also highlights this bug affecting suggestions for `git push -u` commands.

### Bug Cause Explanation

The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of the removal of the option and its arguments. The function incorrectly removes the same index from `command.script_parts` twice, causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index again.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove the option and its argument correctly from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we should cover cases where both possible indices are present without duplicating the removal operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        argument_index = upstream_option_index + 1
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            argument_index = upstream_option_index + 1
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and argument_index < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(argument_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Updated Test Function `test_get_new_command`

Ensure that the test cases in `test_git_push.py` are appropriately structured to reflect the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function.
