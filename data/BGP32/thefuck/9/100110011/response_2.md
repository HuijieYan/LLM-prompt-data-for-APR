### Analysis:
- The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are passed in the `git push` command.
- The function searches for these flags in the `command.script_parts` list, removes them if found, and then extracts the branch information from the stderr message to construct the new command.
- The bug occurs when trying to remove the found index from the `command.script_parts` list using `pop()`, potentially leading to an `IndexError`.

### Identified Potential Error:
- The potential error lies in the double `pop()` call on the `command.script_parts` list after finding the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag. Since the `.pop()` operation changes the list in place, it causes the second pop to access an index that might be out of range.

### Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug is two-fold:
  - First, the `upstream_option_index` is not reset to `-1` after the first fail of searching for `--set-upstream` flag, which can cause incorrect behavior.
  - Second, the double `pop(upstream_option_index)` calls remove the item at that index twice, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the list beyond its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Reset the `upstream_option_index` to `-1` after each search operation for the flags.
- Utilize a single `pop()` operation to remove the item at the `upstream_option_index`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function addresses the bugs related to incorrect index handling and double usage of `pop()`. By resetting the `upstream_option_index` and using a single `pop()` operation, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
