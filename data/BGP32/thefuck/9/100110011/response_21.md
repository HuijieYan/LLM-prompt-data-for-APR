### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to adjust the command for git push when certain options are passed. It removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command and then extracts the suggested command from the stderr output. The issue arises due to an incorrect index manipulation when removing the options and arguments.
2. The failing test is checking if the corrected command matches the expected output. The error message specifies an `IndexError` on line 27 of the `git_push.py` file, indicating an issue with the pop operation.
3. The bug is caused by attempting to perform `pop` twice on the same index, leading to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. The fix required is to remove the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line as it tries to pop the same index again, which doesn't exist after the first pop operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only the correct index is popped once.
5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
