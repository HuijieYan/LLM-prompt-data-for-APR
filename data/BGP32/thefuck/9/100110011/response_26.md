### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_new_command(command)` defined in `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`.
2. The issue causing the bug is the attempt to pop the same index twice in the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The failing test case tries to pass `git push -u` command to `get_new_command` function.
4. The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect duplicated popping of the index in the `command.script_parts` list.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check the existence of the index before popping elements from the list. Also, the extraction of the suggestion from `stderr` is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the index `upstream_option_index` is a valid index before performing `pop` operations.
2. Extract the correct suggestion from `stderr` by parsing the required information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Remaining arguments will be concatenated to the command suggested by git.
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].rsplit(' ', 1)[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the bug causing the index error when popping elements from the list will be fixed, and the function will correctly extract the suggestion from `stderr` to provide the new command.
