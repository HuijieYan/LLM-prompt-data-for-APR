### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to modify the command based on Git push errors by removing certain parts and replacing them with correct arguments.
2. The function is trying to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command. If found, it removes those parts and extracts the correct `push_upstream` argument from the error message.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect index manipulation where `pop` is called twice on the same index, causing an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list only once when the index is found.
5. We should also extract the correct `push_upstream` from the error message and replace it in the command for successful correction.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if not found already
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove only once
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        command.script_parts.insert(upstream_option_index, 'push') # Reinsert 'push' at index
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

By adjusting the removal of elements only once and reinserting `'push'` at the correct index, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
