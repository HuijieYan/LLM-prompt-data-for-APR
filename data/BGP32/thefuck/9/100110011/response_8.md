### Analyzing the Bug:
The buggy function `get_new_command` in the `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` file is designed to handle git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, as they are concatenated onto the suggested git command. The function then extracts the suggested git command from the error message and constructs a new command to replace the original one.

The failing test in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` expects specific output for different variations of the git push command with the error message provided. The error message mentions a suggestion for setting up the upstream branch using `git push --set-upstream origin master`.

The error occurs at the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line when trying to remove the same index twice.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The error message provided includes a suggestion containing the phrase `git push --set-upstream origin master`.
2. The buggy function incorrectly tries to remove the double occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, leading to an IndexError since the index is removed twice.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option exists before removing it.
2. Make sure to remove it only once from the `script_parts`.
3. Extract the correct suggestion from the error message to generate a new command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the '--set-upstream' option
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the '-u' option
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option only once, as intended. It will then extract the correct suggestion from the error message to construct the new git push command. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
