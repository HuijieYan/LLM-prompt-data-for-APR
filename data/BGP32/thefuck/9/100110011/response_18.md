### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command. Then, it extracts the effective `git push` command from the stderr output of a failed `git push`.
2. The error occurs when the `pop` method is used to remove the index found before. The index is mistakenly popped twice, leading to an `IndexError` due to the second pop trying to access an out-of-range index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by populating the `upstream_option_index` value correctly; however, the `command.script_parts.pop` statement is called twice in case the flag is present, leading to the second call trying to pop an index that has already been removed, causing the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line needs to be removed or replaced with a safeguard to ensure it only pops once if the flag is present.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Change the condition to check if the flag exists
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the first instance of the flag
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # If flag not found, return the original command
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the index is only popped once if the flag is present. By checking if the flag exists, we prevent the second pop attempt after already removing the option, fixing the `IndexError` issue.
