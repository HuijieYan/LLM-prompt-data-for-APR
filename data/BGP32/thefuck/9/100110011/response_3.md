### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for git push by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments before returning a modified push command.
2. The error arises when attempting to remove the elements using `pop()` with the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test cases are trying to assert the modified commands after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option with the correct push options.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the index for `pop()` is only used once to remove the desired element, and we should handle cases where the options may not be present in the command.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle the removal of the specified options gracefully and construct the new push command accordingly.

### Bug Fix for the Buggy Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    updated_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    try:
        upstream_option_index = updated_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        updated_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = updated_parts.index('-u')
        updated_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options without attempting to pop the same index twice, resolving the `IndexError` encountered in the failing test cases. This fix addresses the root cause of the bug and ensures the function behaves as intended.
