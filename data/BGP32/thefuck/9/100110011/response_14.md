### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is used to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replacing the `push` argument with the suggested upstream branch.
2. The error occurs at `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line due to trying to pop two elements at the same index leading to an IndexError.
3. The failing test tries to verify different scenarios of git push commands with the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and expects the corrected new command with the suggested upstream branch. The bug causes an IndexError when attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.
4. To fix the bug, we should only pop one element related to the detected upstream option index instead of two elements.
5. A corrected version of the function has been provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
