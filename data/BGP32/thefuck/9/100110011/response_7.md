### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to handle the case where the `git push` command fails due to missing upstream branch and then suggest a corrected command with the upstream set. The error occurs due to incorrect popping of elements in the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index again.

### Error Cause:
1. In the case where `-u` flag is encountered, the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of `-u` in `command.script_parts`.
2. Later, in the condition where `upstream_option_index` is not `-1`, two `pop(upstream_option_index)` calls are made in succession, removing the same index twice from the list.
3. This causes `IndexError` as the list is modified after the first `pop` call.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should remove the second `pop` call from the code. The correct strategy is to remove only the specific element at the `upstream_option_index` once.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By removing the redundant `pop` call in the corrected function, the bug causing the `IndexError` has been fixed. This corrected version should now pass all the failing tests and resolve the corresponding GitHub issue as well.
