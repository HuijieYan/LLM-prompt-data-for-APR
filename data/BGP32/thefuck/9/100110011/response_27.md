### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle `git push` commands and modify them based on certain conditions.
2. The function attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command's script parts, removes them if found, then extracts the push upstream suggestion from stderr and replaces the push argument in the command.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of removing the found index twice within the script parts, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an already removed index. The error message suggests that the pop index is out of range.
4. The failing test cases expect the corrected command output after processing the input `git push` commands.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the line:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
This code tries to remove the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an index that is already removed in the first try.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should only pop the index once if it is found. We can modify the code to remove the index only if it exists in the script parts list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these modifications, the function should now handle the `git push` commands as expected and pass the failing test cases described.
