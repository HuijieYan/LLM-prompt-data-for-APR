### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. Then, it extracts the suggested `push_upstream` command from the stderr and replaces the `push` command with this suggestion in the original command.
2. The bug occurs because after removing the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, the subsequent pop operation tries to remove an item at the same index again, causing an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test is trying to verify the correction of the `push` command after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 of the `git_push.py` file.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the pop operation is only executed if the index is valid, and we need to handle the case when there is only one option element in the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting the pop operations.
2. Handle the case where there's only one option element by checking if the index is less than the length of the `script_parts` list.
3. Consider the scenario where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options might be present and ensure both are removed if found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index > 0:  # Verify valid index before proceeding
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check index for last element
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these adjustments in the `get_new_command` function, it should now handle the edge cases properly and not cause the `IndexError` that was observed in the failing test.
