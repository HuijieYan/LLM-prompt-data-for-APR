### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed in `git push` commands.
2. The function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command.
3. The error occurs due to the way index values are being manipulated and popped from `command.script_parts`.
4. The failing test cases are trying to match the expected output with the corrected `git push` command.
5. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to popping an element from an empty list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the handling of `upstream_option_index`. When both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, the index of `-u` is overwritten by the index of `--set-upstream`. When popping elements from `command.script_parts`, there is an attempt to pop the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` exist, then update the `upstream_option_index` accordingly.
2. Instead of popping the same index twice, adjust the logic to remove only once for a given option.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = None
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        current_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index and current_index > upstream_option_index:
            pass
        else:
            upstream_option_index = current_index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After making these changes, the function should correctly handle the `git push` commands with `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and pass the failing tests.
