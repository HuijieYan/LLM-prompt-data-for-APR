## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing in the test due to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an item from `command.script_parts` list. The error message indicates that the index is out of range.
2. The buggy function is supposed to modify the command by removing specific options like `--set-upstream` or `-u` and then return a modified command.
3. The failing test is trying to assert the correct modified command after calling the `get_new_command` function with different inputs.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of removing items from the `command.script_parts` list when the target options (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) are found. The bug leads to popping an element twice when `-u` is present, causing the index to go out of range. 
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we remove the target options correctly without causing index out of range errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to properly handle the removal of the target options (`--set-upstream` or `-u`). If `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`, we should remove it once. 
2. To avoid double popping, we will use a single if-else condition to remove the target option based on its index in the `command.script_parts` list.
3. Additionally, we should handle the scenario where the target options are not found in the list.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the removal of the target options appropriately, ensuring that we do not encounter an index out of range error. This correction should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
