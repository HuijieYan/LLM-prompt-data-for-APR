### Analysis:
1. The buggy function attempts to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command and its argument. It then extracts the suggested command from the output, and replaces the argument in the original command with the extracted suggestion.
2. The failing test asserts the function's output for different variations of 'git push' commands with the expected result.
3. The error occurs in the buggy function when trying to pop the element at the same index twice after removing the option. This leads to an IndexError as the list becomes shorter after the first removal operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only pop elements if they exist in the list. We should also consider the case where the option index is not found in the script parts.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) >= upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) >= upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding the condition `len(command.script_parts) >= upstream_option_index + 1` before popping elements, we ensure that we only pop if the element exists at that index. This prevents the IndexError when trying to pop the same index twice.
