### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a Git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, then replacing the `push` command with the actual upstream branch that needs to be set. The bug seems to be related to handling the upstream option index and popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Error Location:
The error seems to occur in the section where the `command.script_parts` list is being modified based on the detected upstream option index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts` when removing the upstream option and its argument. Since the index is the same for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, an IndexError is raised when trying to pop the same index twice.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only pop the detected upstream option index once when removing the option and its argument. Additionally, we should handle cases where the upstream option is not found in the `script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By handling each upstream option index separately and adding proper error handling, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
