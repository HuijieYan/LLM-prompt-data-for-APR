### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the input git command based on the stderr output provided. It looks for specific flags (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) in the input command and then extracts the suggested git push command from the stderr message.
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the identified flag and its argument from the command. The issue arises from trying to pop the same index from the list `command.script_parts` twice, even if only one element is being removed due to the presence of `-u` or `--set-upstream` flags.
3. The failing test provides input commands with `-u` flag and expects the correct transformation according to the stderr message. The error message indicates an IndexError when trying to pop an index out of range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only one pop operation is performed for the identified index. It is essential to handle the scenario where only one of the flags (`-u` or `--set-upstream`) is present in the command.
5. The corrected version of the function will remove only one element at the identified index if either `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag is present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If '--set-upstream' or '-u' are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these updates, the function should be able to handle the cases where `-u` flag or `--set-upstream` flag is present in the git command and generate the correct suggested git push command based on the stderr message.
