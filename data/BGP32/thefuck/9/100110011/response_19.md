### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is passed in the git push command and provides a new corrected command to replace the old one. The error encountered is an `IndexError`.
2. The failing test provides an example where the function fails to handle the `git push -u` command correctly. The test expects the result to be `"git push --set-upstream origin master"`.
3. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurs in the line where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice. This suggests that the index intended to remove the option is out of range.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the index used for popping the elements is within the valid range of the list.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Note:
- The corrected version includes a check to ensure that the index is less than the length of the script parts before the second pop operation is performed to avoid the IndexError.
- This fix should address the issue and make the function work correctly for the provided test cases.
