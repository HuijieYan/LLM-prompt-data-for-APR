### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command and replace it with the correct argument. However, there are a few issues in the current implementation:
1. The code is trying to find the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately, but it is not handling the case where both are present in the command.
2. The removal of the option and its argument is incorrect because it is removing the element at `upstream_option_index` twice.
3. The extraction of the correct push argument from `command.stderr` is not accurate.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code is not correctly identifying and handling the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the command. Additionally, the extraction of the correct push argument from `command.stderr` is also leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and handle them appropriately.
2. Update the logic to remove the option and its argument correctly.
3. Fix the extraction of the correct push argument from `command.stderr` to ensure accuracy.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u options
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Handle the case of both options being present
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct push argument from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and extract the push argument accurately.
