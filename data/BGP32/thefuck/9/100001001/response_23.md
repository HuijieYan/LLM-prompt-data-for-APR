### Explanation:
The bug in the function is that it attempts to remove the `-u` option even if `--set-upstream` has already been removed, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the `-u` option index.

### Bug location:
The bug is located in the following section of the code:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:  # should be !=
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

### Bug cause:
The bug causes an IndexError because the function attempts to pop the same index twice, even if the `--set-upstream` option has already been removed, leading to an attempt to access an index that doesn't exist in `command.script_parts`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of removing by index twice, only remove the index once.
2. Update the check condition to check if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present before attempting to remove them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the removal of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options without causing an IndexError.
