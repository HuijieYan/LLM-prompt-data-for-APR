### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The function checks for the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, but the second check overrides the value of `upstream_option_index` from the first check. As a result, only `-u` is being considered and the subsequent logic is based on that.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are considered, and their arguments are removed properly from the command parts.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        new_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index < 0 or new_index < upstream_option_index:
            upstream_option_index = new_index
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the code to consider both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and ensuring that the correct argument is removed from the command parts, we have addressed the bug in the function.
