### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to manipulate a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and replacing the `push` argument with the actual branch name. However, there are errors in the code that prevent it from working correctly.

### Issues
1. The logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is flawed, as it only removes the option without removing its argument properly.
2. The extraction of the branch name from the `stderr` output is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the `push_upstream` variable incorrectly captures the entire string `'push --set-upstream origin master'` from the `stderr`, instead of just extracting the branch name `origin master` that should be used in the final command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and properly extract the actual branch name from the stderr output.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the actual branch name from the stderr output
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = lines[-3].strip().partition(' ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the logic for removing the options and properly extracting the branch name, the function should now work as intended.
