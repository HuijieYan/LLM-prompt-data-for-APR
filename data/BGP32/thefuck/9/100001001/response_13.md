### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current function is that when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the `command.script_parts`, only one of them is being removed from the list of script parts. This results in an incorrect command being reconstructed when `replace_argument` is called.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we should remove both the option and its corresponding argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, there is an issue with extracting `push_upstream` that needs to be addressed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

After making these adjustments, the function should correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and properly construct the new command with the extracted `push_upstream` value.
