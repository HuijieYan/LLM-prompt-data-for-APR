### Error location:
The error in the buggy function is with the logic that tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list. The issue arises because the second `try` block overwrites the value of `upstream_option_index` obtained from the first `try` block.

### Cause of the bug:
When the second `try` block runs after the first `try` block in the buggy function, it resets the value of `upstream_option_index` even if it was successfully found in the first `try` block. This causes the if condition to check for `-1` to incorrectly execute even if the option is found in either of the two positions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second `try` block only runs if the `upstream_option_index` is still set to the initial value of -1. If the option is found successfully in either of the cases, we should not change the value of `upstream_option_index`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By making this adjustment, we ensure that the value of `upstream_option_index` is only updated if it hasn't been found already, thereby preventing the bug in the function.
