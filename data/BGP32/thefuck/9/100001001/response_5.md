### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. However, the code is flawed in several ways:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 initially, so even if the option is found in the list, it will never be removed.
2. When removing elements from the list, the function pops the elements at the same index twice, which will not work correctly.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the `upstream_option_index` is not being updated correctly when searching for the `-u` option. As a result, even if the `-u` option is present in the list, it will not be removed. Additionally, the popping logic for removing elements from the list is incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `upstream_option_index` when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Update the popping logic to remove the option and its argument correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version should address the issues in the buggy function, correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts list.
