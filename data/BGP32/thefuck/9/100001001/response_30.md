### Explanation:
The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the `-u` flag is used instead of `--set-upstream`. The code tries to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags from the command arguments list, but it incorrectly removes the same index twice. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to construct the new command to replace the original `git push` command.

### Bug location:
The bug is located in the section where it removes the flags from the `command.script_parts` list. The removal of the index is not done properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present separately and remove them correctly from the `command.script_parts` list.

### The corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags from the `command.script_parts` list based on their presence. It ensures that the index removal is done correctly and allows the function to construct the new command without errors.
