### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function lies in the logic used to find and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command script parts. The issue is that if both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present, the code removes the same index twice, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to remove the found index only once, and not try to remove a non-existent index in case both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = []
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
