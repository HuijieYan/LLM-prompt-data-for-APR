### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs because the code is incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the command's script parts. The function is attempting to remove these flags by using the index method to find their positions in the list of script parts. However, the bug arises when the function tries to remove the same flag twice in the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present.

### Bug Location
The issue is located in the following section of the code:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
Here, the function is popping the element at `upstream_option_index` twice if the flag is found, which causes the script parts to shift incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to only remove the flag once, regardless of whether it was `--set-upstream` or `-u`. Additionally, we need to update the index correctly after removing the flag to prevent indexing errors.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Update the index after removing the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is only removed once and adjusts the index properly after the removal to avoid any indexing errors.
