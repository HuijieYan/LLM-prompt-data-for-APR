The bug in the function is related to how it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list. The issue arises from how the indexes of these options are being handled and removed from the list.

In the buggy function:
1. The function is checking for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately, but it is not handling the scenario where both options are present in the command.
2. The removal of the options from the script_parts list is incorrect as it removes the same index twice, leading to potential errors in the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, we can:
1. Modify the logic to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in a single block.
2. Update the removal of the options from the script_parts list to avoid removing the same index twice.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'push':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and generate the new command accordingly.
