### Explanation:
The bug in the function lies in the way the upstream option index is being handled. The code attempts to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `script_parts` of the command. However, the second try block for '-u' always overwrites the value found in the first try block for '--set-upstream'. This results in the incorrect removal of the option and its argument from the script parts.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if '--set-upstream' is found, we do not check for '-u' and vice versa. Additionally, the removal of both the option and its argument should be handled correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # remove argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle finding and removing either '--set-upstream' or '-u' options along with their arguments from the command script parts.
