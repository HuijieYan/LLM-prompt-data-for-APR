### Explanation:
The bug in the current implementation lies in how the `upstream_option_index` variable is being checked and updated. The intention of the code is to check if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` list, and if so, remove them along with their argument from the list. However, the code is currently overwriting `upstream_option_index` incorrectly, resulting in only one of the options being considered.

### Bug:
- The `upstream_option_index` is being overwritten when checking for `-u`, causing it to only consider the last option.
- The lines `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` are not removing both the option and its argument as intended.

### Fix:
1. Use separate variables to track the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. Modify the removal of the options and their arguments to ensure both are removed correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    upstream_option_index_short = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index_short = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif upstream_option_index_short != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_short)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_short)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By maintaining separate indexes for `--set-upstream` and `-u`, we can ensure that both options and their arguments are correctly removed from the list of `command.script_parts`.
