### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to handle the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument before constructing a new command. However, the bug seems to be in the way the index of the upstream options is being handled and removed.

### Bug
The bug lies in how the upstream option index is being handled and removed. The code is checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` independently, but when removing the elements from `command.script_parts`, it is not considering the correct index.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we should only check for either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, and once we find the index, we should remove both the option and its argument correctly from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the code to remove both the option and its argument correctly once the index is found, the function should now correctly handle the git push command.
