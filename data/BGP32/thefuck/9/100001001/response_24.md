The bug in the current function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is being updated and utilized. The code is attempting to find the index of either '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list, but it is not correctly handling the case where both options are present or where only one of them is found. Additionally, the code erroneously removes both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the code logic to properly handle finding and removing either '--set-upstream' or '-u' from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we should correct the removal step to only remove the option and its argument once.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles finding and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments. It also correctly extracts the push command from the stderr message.
