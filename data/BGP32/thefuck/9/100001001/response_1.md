### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command and replace it with the actual branch information extracted from the stderr. However, the current implementation has a bug where it incorrectly removes the option and its argument before getting the branch information.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code is removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument before extracting the branch information from the stderr. This results in the incorrect branch information being retrieved and used in the new command.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should first extract the branch information from the stderr before removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. This way, we ensure that the correct branch information is used in the new command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove option and its argument
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the branch information is extracted before removing the option and its argument, ensuring that the correct branch information is used in the new command.
