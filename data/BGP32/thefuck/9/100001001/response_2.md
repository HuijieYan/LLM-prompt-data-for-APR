### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list and then construct a new command to replace the `push` command with the correct upstream branch. However, the current implementation has a bug where it is not correctly removing the upstream option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug
The bug lies in the logic used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The code is popping the elements `twice` for `upstream_option_index`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the elements are being removed from the `command.script_parts` list after identifying the index of the upstream option. We should only pop one element at the identified index.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove second pop

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
