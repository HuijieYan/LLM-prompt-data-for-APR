### Explanation
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the list of command parts and then extract the argument passed after the `git push` command from the error message. However, there are two issues causing the bug:
1. The code to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is incorrect as it is popping the same index twice, which can lead to an index out of range error.
2. The extraction of the push upstream argument from the error message is also incorrect as it is not handling the case where the error message structure might change.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the code to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the list of command parts by popping the index only once.
2. Update the code to extract the push upstream argument in a more robust way to handle changes in the error message structure.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the push upstream argument from the error message
    push_upstream = ''
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git push ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function handles both issues mentioned and should now work correctly with the provided test case.
