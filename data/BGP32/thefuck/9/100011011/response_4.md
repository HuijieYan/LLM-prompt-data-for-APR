### Analysis:
1. The function is designed to handle Git commands and modifies the command based on certain conditions. Specifically, it attempts to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the command and extract the branch information from the stderr.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop twice from the `command.script_parts`. This leads to an IndexError when popping an index that is out of range.
3. The failing test case `test_get_new_command` highlights the issue by triggering the error when the command involves a '-u' option.
4. The bug stems from mistakenly attempting to pop twice when removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option once from `command.script_parts`. There is no need to pop it twice, as this leads to IndexError since the list is modified after the first pop operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script
```

### The corrected version of the function ensures that the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is removed correctly without causing an IndexError. This fix will resolve the failing test case and address the GitHub issue related to this bug.
