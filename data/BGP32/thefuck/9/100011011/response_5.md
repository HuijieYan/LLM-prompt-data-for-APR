### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then extract the `push` argument from the `stderr` message. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts`. This suggests that the `upstream_option_index` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is being used incorrectly to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. The issue arises when both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options are present, and the function tries to pop an element that might not exist in the list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the removal of the options from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the function should check if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present and handle them appropriately.

### Corrected Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By fixing the logic for handling the removal of options and arguments and also adjusting the index for extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` message, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and address the reported issue on GitHub.
