### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument along with its value from the command and replace the `push` command with the correct value extracted from the stderr message.
2. The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index twice in the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the command.
3. The failing test case tries to provide a command with `-u` argument, which leads to an IndexError because the pop operation is attempted twice on the same index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only one pop operation is done when removing the argument and its value from the command.

### Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == 'origin':
            # If the previous part was 'origin' (argument for --set-upstream or -u), we remove it too
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated code includes checks for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, removes the argument along with its value correctly, and avoids the double pop operation issue.
