### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case of a failed git push command where the current branch has no upstream branch. The function searches for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the command and removes them along with their arguments. It then extracts the suggested command from the error message to be used in the new command.

In the failing test, the first command `git push` provides the expected result, but the second command `git push -u` fails with an `IndexError` during the `pop()` operation. This is likely due to removing the same index twice, leading to an index out of range error.

### Bug Identification

The bug originates from the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The function mistakenly tries to remove the index twice if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the input command.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are found in the input command, they are removed only once without causing an `IndexError` during the list `pop()` operation.

### Corrected Version

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        argument_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream') if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts else command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(argument_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will remove the option and its argument only once, preventing the `IndexError` that occurred previously. This updated version should now pass the failing test case.
