### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the `git push` command and extract the upstream branch information from the error message.
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument from the command script parts. The index used for popping elements from the list is out of range, leading to the `IndexError`.
3. The failing test case provides `['git', 'push']` as the `command.script_parts`, which does not contain `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments. This leads to an empty list causing the error. The expected output of the test is `git push --set-upstream origin master`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if the indices for `-u` and `--set-upstream` are valid before popping elements from the list.
5. In the corrected version, we will add checks for the indices of `-u` and `--set-upstream` before trying to remove the elements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract push upstream information from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version includes a check to ensure that the indices of `-u` and `--set-upstream` are valid before popping elements from the list. This strategy prevents the `IndexError` by only attempting to pop elements if the indices and list length are appropriate.
