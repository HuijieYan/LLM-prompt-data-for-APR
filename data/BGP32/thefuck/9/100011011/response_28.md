### Analyzing the buggy function
The `get_new_command` function is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the list of script parts. It then extracts the suggestion for the correct command from the `stderr` output of the original `git push` command.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The `upstream_option_index` calculation might not work correctly when multiple flags are present in the command.
2. The pop operation on `command.script_parts` could raise an `IndexError`.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is caused due to the pop operation attempting to remove elements at an index that is out of range for certain cases. This issue is exacerbated when the `-u` flag is present in the `git push` command.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is correctly calculated when multiple flags are present in the command. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `-u` flag is one of the script parts to prevent the pop operation from resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Find the index of the flag in the list of script parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # Extract the suggestion for the correct command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should handle multiple flags correctly and prevent `IndexError` during the pop operation.
