### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is passed in the git push command and modify the command accordingly. However, the current implementation is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the script parts list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to pop twice from the `command.script_parts` list after an optional element is removed. In this case, when the `-u` flag is present, it is trying to pop twice, which results in an `IndexError` as the list length is reduced after the first pop operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can adjust the indexing and popping logic to only pop once if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found in the script parts list.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.pop(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.pop(command.script_parts.index('-u'))

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adjusting the logic to only remove the flag once, the corrected function should now handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag correctly and return the expected new command string based on the provided test case.
