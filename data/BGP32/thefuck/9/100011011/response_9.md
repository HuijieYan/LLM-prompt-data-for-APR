### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed to a `git push` command. It removes these options and their arguments and then suggests the correct `git push` command based on the error message provided. The error occurs because the function attempts to pop elements from a list without checking if the element exists at that index, causing an `IndexError`. The test case failing is when `-u` is passed to `git push`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function sets `upstream_option_index` to `-1` initially.
2. It then tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. If `-u` is found, it overwrites the `upstream_option_index` variable.
3. If at least one of the options is present, it tries to pop the element at `upstream_option_index`. If `-u` is the last element, the function successfully pops it. However, for the subsequent pop call, it tries to pop again at the same index which is now out of range, causing an `IndexError`.
4. The error originates from the line where the second pop operation is performed.

### Fix Strategy
To prevent the `IndexError`, the function should only pop elements if the index is within the bounds of the list. This can be achieved by checking the length of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to pop elements at a specific index.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding the check `len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1` before popping elements, the corrected function ensures that it doesn't try to pop an element from the list if the index is out of range. This modification fixes the issue causing the `IndexError` and should now handle the case of `-u` being passed to the `git push` command correctly.
