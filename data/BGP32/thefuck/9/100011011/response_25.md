### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is designed to handle the case when `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are passed in the `git push` command. The goal is to remove these flags from the input command and extract the upstream reference to be used in constructing the corrected command. The error message and failing test indicate that there is an `IndexError` occurring within the function.

The error message is obtained during the test execution where the input command is `'git push -u'`. The stderr value provided in the test contains information about setting the upstream branch, which needs to be used to construct the corrected command. The function is failing to handle the correct indexes to remove the flags and extract the upstream reference.

The critical part of the bug seems to be with the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list, specifically when trying to remove elements based on the computed index. The test cases exercise the scenario where the `-u` flag is present in the `script_parts`, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags is identified and used to remove them. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` part from the `command.stderr` seems to be functioning correctly, so the focus should be on resolving the index issue.

The bug can be fixed by:
1. Checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately and removing them if found.
2. Utilizing a condition to determine if the index found is valid before popping elements from the list to avoid `IndexError`.
3. Ensuring that the push_upstream extraction is accurate and correctly formatted in the final command.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary

The corrected version of the function includes proper handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, ensuring that index manipulation is done safely to avoid errors. The function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the bug.
