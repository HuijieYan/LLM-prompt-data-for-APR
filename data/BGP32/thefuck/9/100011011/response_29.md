### Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to handle git commands that need to be modified before executing. In this case, it is specifically focusing on git push commands.
2. The error occurs when trying to remove the index fetched from the `command.script_parts` list that contains the `-u` option.
3. The error message indicates an `IndexError` related to popping an index out of range.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that the initial implementation was correct before a certain fix (#538) caused the bug.
5. The error is due to the redundant popping of the same index for both remove options (`--set-upstream` and `-u`). This leads to an `IndexError` as the index gets removed before being popped the second time.

### Fix Strategy
To correct the bug, we need to ensure that the index retrieved for the `-u` option is only popped from the `command.script_parts` list once. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index_u = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the 'push' argument as well
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif upstream_option_index_u != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)
        # Remove the 'push' argument as well
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `-u` flag without throwing an `IndexError`.
