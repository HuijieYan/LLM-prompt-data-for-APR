### Analysis
The error occurring in the test is an `IndexError: pop index out of range`. The error happens when trying to pop an index from `command.script_parts` that is out of range.

Looking at the code, the issue lies in the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `command.script_parts`. The function first tries to find the index of `--set-upstream`, but then immediately overwrites the `upstream_option_index` with the index of `-u`, leading to a potential issue if `--set-upstream` was not found.

### Bug Explanation
1. The first `try-except` block finds the index of `--set-upstream`. If found, it sets `upstream_option_index` to the correct value.
2. Then, the second `try-except` block immediately overwrites `upstream_option_index` with the index of `-u`. This can cause a problem if `--set-upstream` is not present, as the value of `-u` might be assigned to `upstream_option_index`, which could be -1.
3. If either argument is found, the subsequent code removes both the option and its argument. When it comes to popping the argument index, even if the argument was not found (index is -1), it still tries to pop that index.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should handle the cases where each argument is not found independently. Additionally, during the removal of the argument, ensure that the index is valid before trying to pop it.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    upstream_short_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_short_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Pop the argument as well

    if upstream_short_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_option_index)  # Pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version correctly handles finding and removing both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their respective arguments.
