### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding value from the `command.script_parts` list if it exists. Then, it extracts the suggested push command from the stderr output and replaces the argument with it.
- The failing test is trying to verify the corrected command after removing the `-u` option.

### Identified bug and cause
- The bug is caused because when the `-u` option is detected, two elements are popped from the `command.script_parts` list, but the index used the second time to pop the next element is now invalid since the list has been modified.
- This leads to an `IndexError: pop index out of range` as observed in the failing test.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the elements are removed by popping. Since two elements are being popped, we can remove both elements at once and update the loop accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Check if the option is available and remove it along with its argument in one step
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the argument exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating how the elements are removed and handling the scenario where the argument might be missing after the option, we ensure that the function operates correctly and passes the failing test.
