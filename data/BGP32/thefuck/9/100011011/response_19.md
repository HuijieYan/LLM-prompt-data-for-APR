### Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list using an index that is out of range. This happens because the code first searches for `--set-upstream` index, then overwrites it with the index for `-u` if it exists. However, when both are not found, the index remains as `-1`, leading to an out of range index error when trying to pop.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where neither `--set-upstream` nor `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`. We should only try to pop the elements if we have a valid index.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Note
The corrected version of the function now checks if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to find their index. This prevents the out of range error and the function should now work without issues for the given test cases.
