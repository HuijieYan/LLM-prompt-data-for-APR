### Analysis
The buggy function is trying to extract the push command and relevant arguments from the stderr message, but it is encountering an `IndexError` when trying to pop the element from `command.script_parts`. The function is incorrectly trying to pop the element twice. This leads to the issue when `'-u'` is included in the command.

### Bug Cause
The bug is being caused by the function attempting to pop the same index twice.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the `'-u'` flag is detected, only one pop operation is performed, removing the `'-u'` flag.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correcting the pop index logic in the above code, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test cases.
