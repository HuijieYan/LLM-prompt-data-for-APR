### Analysis:
- The buggy function attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and then removes that index and the next element from the list.
- The error occurs when trying to pop the same index again after it has already been removed, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by attempting to pop an index from `command.script_parts` twice, leading to the removal of an already deleted index.
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an index out of range.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that after removing an index from the list, subsequent removals are not attempted on the same index.
- Check if the `upstream_option_index` is valid before popping elements from the list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Ensure the index is still valid after the first pop operation
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking for the index's validity before performing the second pop operation, the corrected function ensures that the index is still within the bounds of the list. This fix should address the IndexError and pass the failing test cases.
