### Analysis
The buggy function is failing because it is trying to pop the same index twice, which causes an `IndexError` when the index goes out of range. This issue is highlighted in the failing test case where `-u` is passed, resulting in the removal of the same option for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.

### Bug Explanation
- The function searches for the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them. However, the second `pop` operation after finding `-u` is incorrect as it tries to pop the same index that was already removed by `--set-upstream`, leading to an `IndexError` since the index is out of range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that each index is popped only once. We can track and adjust the index correctly for the second occurrence. This ensures that we remove the specified options without running into index out of range errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        # Adjust index for -u as --set-upstream is removed and -u will occur earlier
        if upstream_option_index_u >= upstream_option_index:
            upstream_option_index_u -= 1
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if upstream_option_index_u is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version adjusts the index for `-u` if `--set-upstream` is found and removed. It ensures that both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are removed correctly based on their respective indices. This fix should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as intended.
