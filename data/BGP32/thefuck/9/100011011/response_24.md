### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which aims to modify the command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and replace the `push` argument with the suggested argument fetched from the error message.
- The bug occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list.
- The error message and failing test provide scenarios where the function fails:
   1. When `'-u'` is present in the script_parts list.
   2. When `--set-upstream` is not present in the script_parts list.
- The function fails in the second scenario because it assumes that if the first condition fails, it should move on to the second condition without resetting `upstream_option_index`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Reset the `upstream_option_index` after it has been used and not found.
2. Handle both conditions separately to avoid errors.
3. Use a safer approach to remove elements from the list to ensure it doesn't result in an `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    # Check for '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Pop the next element only if it is within the list's range
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By implementing the above changes, the corrected version of the function should now accurately handle both conditions, avoiding the `IndexError` and yielding the expected results for the failing test cases.
