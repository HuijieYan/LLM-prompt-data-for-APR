### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `script_parts` list in the `command` object and extract the command suggested by git from the stderr message. The bug causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop from `command.script_parts` based on the previously stored `upstream_option_index`. This is particularly evident in the failing test `test_get_new_command`, where the `assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))` causes the `IndexError`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Assigning `upstream_option_index` to `-1` outside the `try-except` blocks.
2. Incorrectly using `pop` method causing the `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from improperly handling the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the `script_parts`. Since the `catch` blocks do not differentiate between the two options, the index is overwritten when the second option is checked. Additionally, the pop operation twice on the same index inside the `if` block leads to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Keep separate variables to store the index for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. Handle the removal of the argument correctly using the stored valid index.
3. Ensure to check if the index is valid before trying to pop from the list.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    upstream_short_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_short_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif upstream_short_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_short_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that separate indexes are used for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. It also corrects the pop operations based on the presence of these options and checks for valid indexes before removing elements from the list. The corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
