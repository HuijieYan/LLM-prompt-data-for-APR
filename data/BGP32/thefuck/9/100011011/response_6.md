### Issue Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments from the list of command parts. However, the index used to remove the options and arguments is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to remove the index twice. This results in the bug and the failing test case.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice without considering that once an item is removed, the index positions of the subsequent items change. As a result, the second `pop` operation goes out of range, leading to the `IndexError`. This issue is visible in the failing test where the `IndexError: pop index out of range` occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that we remove both the option and its corresponding argument while considering the changing index positions after each removal.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in upstream_indexes:
        if index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Test
After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing test case should pass successfully without throwing an `IndexError`.
