### Analysis
The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the `pop` function, specifically that the pop index is out of range. This suggests that the index being used to remove elements from `command.script_parts` is either not found in the list or after the first removal, it points to an out-of-range index.

In the failing test, the command provided has `'-u'` as an argument, which triggers the attempt to remove that argument along with its argument value from `command.script_parts`. The initial index stored in `upstream_option_index` does not reflect this specific case, resulting in the second removal being attempted at an incorrect index.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the fact that if the `'-u'` option is found, the index stored is overwritten, leading to the removal operation being performed again at this new index, which is invalid and results in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, each `try` block that searches for either `--set-upstream` or `-u` should be independent from each other. If the `--set-upstream` option is found, the `upstream_option_index` should be updated only in that case. The same applies to the `-u` option. By keeping these two operations separate, the correct index for popping elements will be maintained.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Only update if not already found
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying the above correction, the function should now handle the removal of the `-u` option correctly, ensuring that the pop operation is only performed when a valid index is found for it. This change should resolve the issue and the failing test case.
