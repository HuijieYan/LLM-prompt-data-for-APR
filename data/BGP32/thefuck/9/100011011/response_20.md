### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function is `get_new_command(command)` from the `git_push.py` file. The function is designed to modify a git push command based on the stderr output received. The bug occurs when trying to handle the `-u` flag used in the git push command.

### Identified Bug
- The bug occurs when popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list as the same index is popped twice. This results in an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function erroneously pops the same index twice, assuming that the presence of `-u` flag has the same index position in the list as `--set-upstream`. Since `--set-upstream` was searched first, when `-u` is found, it overwrites the index position. As a result, popping the same index twice leads to the IndexError.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately to ensure correct index handling. Additionally, we need to consider cases where only one of the flags is present in the command.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by handling `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately with proper index removal and checks for their presence in the command.

By applying these changes, the function should now correctly modify the git push command as expected by the tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
