### Analysis
The bug occurs when the function is trying to remove `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list even when it has already been removed with `--set-upstream`. This results in an `IndexError` since the index becomes out of range after `--set-upstream` is removed. The function then tries to access the same index again leading to the error.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice for `--set-upstream` and `-u`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts` after processing both `--set-upstream` and `-u`. This causes the index to become out of range when the second pop is executed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should only pop the index once after checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in `command.script_parts`. If `-u` has been removed due to presence of `--set-upstream`, we should safely exit without trying to pop the index again.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After making this change, the function should now properly handle the case where `-u` is not present if `--set-upstream` is detected and removed earlier in the function. This fix should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
