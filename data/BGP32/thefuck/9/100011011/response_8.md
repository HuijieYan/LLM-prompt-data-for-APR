### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the `git push` command. The function intends to remove these options and their arguments from the command and replace them with the suggestion provided by git.

The bug is occurring because the code is trying to pop an element from the list `command.script_parts` without checking if the index exists. This results in an `IndexError` when attempting to pop an element that is out of range.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index we are trying to pop from the list is within the valid range of the list's indices.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them along with their argument if they are found. It also ensures that the index is within the valid range to be popped from the list.
