### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` variable is being handled. The function is attempting to remove the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`, but due to the ordering of the `try-except` blocks, it is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element that does not exist in the list.

The failing test is trying to check if the function can handle the case when `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`, which is causing the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of multiple possible options for finding the index of the upstream argument. The code attempts to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` from the `command.script_parts`, even if only one of them is present. This leads to an `IndexError` if `-u` is not actually present.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of blindly trying to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` regardless of their presence, we should check for each option separately and only remove the one that exists. This prevents potential `IndexError`s.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_flag = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option_flag in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option_flag)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    upstream_short_flag = '-u'
    if upstream_short_flag in command.script_parts:
        short_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_short_flag)
        command.script_parts.pop(short_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By separately checking for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and removing them only if they are found, the corrected function should now handle both cases correctly and pass the failing test.
