### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the provided `git push` command based on the stderr message it receives. The function checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command, removes them, and then extracts the suggested command from the last lines of the stderr message to replace the original `push` command with the suggested one.

The error that is causing the failing test is `IndexError: pop index out of range`. This error occurs when trying to pop an item from a list using an index that is out of range (larger than the size of the list).

Looking at the runtime values and types, it is evident that the function is incorrectly trying to pop twice from `command.script_parts` when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, causing the index to go out of range and leading to the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Instead of popping twice after finding the index of the option, we need to pop only once.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that only one pop operation is performed when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, preventing the index from going out of range and resolving the IndexError.
