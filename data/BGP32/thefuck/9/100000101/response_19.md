### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is meant to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, then extract the suggested git command after the error message from `command.stderr` and replace the 'push' argument with it in the command. The bug arises from how the function handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function incorrectly identifies the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list. It uses two try-except blocks separately for each option, but if the first block finds the index (like in case 2), the second block will incorrectly reset the `upstream_option_index`.
2. The function incorrectly removes the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. It only removes the option itself (`command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`), missing the argument associated with it.
3. The `upstream_option_index` should be set to -1 initially to indicate that the option was not found in the command if an exception was not raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Merge the two try-except blocks into one to correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Adjust the index for removing both the option and its argument to ensure consistency.
3. Set `upstream_option_index` to -1 initially and update it only if an index is found.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the argument associated with the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

The corrected version now correctly identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument from the command.
