### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its associated argument. It then retrieves the suggested git push command from the stderr message and replaces the 'push' command with this new suggestion. 

The bug is likely in the way the `upstream_option_index` is being updated to `-1` before the try-except blocks, which may lead to incorrect removal of the upstream option. Additionally, there is an issue with the way the `push_upstream` is being determined as it is hardcoded and does not consider different cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the incorrect initialization of `upstream_option_index` to -1 outside the try-except blocks. This initialization does not allow for proper handling of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, leading to potential issues when removing these options from the command. Additionally, the method of extracting `push_upstream` from the stderr message is hardcoded and might not handle various scenarios correctly.

### Fix Strategy
1. Initialize `upstream_option_index` within the try-except blocks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately.
2. Extract `push_upstream` dynamically from the stderr message rather than hardcoding it.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_alias_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_alias_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if upstream_alias_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_alias_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_alias_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with handling both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and dynamically retrieving the `push_upstream` value from the stderr message.
