### Analysis:
- The function is intended to process the `command` input by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command's script_parts list. Then it extracts the necessary information to construct the new command by parsing the stderr output.
- The buggy part of the function is in handling the removal of the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The current implementation removes the flag twice, one for the flag and once for its argument, leading to incorrect manipulation of the list.
- The extraction of the `push_upstream` information from the stderr output and constructing the new command seems to be functioning as intended.

### Bug:
- The bug in the function is in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The code currently removes the flag and its argument separately, which is incorrect logic.

### Fix:
- Instead of removing the flag and its argument separately, we should only remove them once at the index where the flag is found.
- We should also adjust the logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Ensure an argument exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Ensure an argument exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the removal of the flag and argument, ensuring that the `command.script_parts` list is modified correctly while processing the input `command` to generate the new command.
