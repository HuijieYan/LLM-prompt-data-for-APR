### Analysis
The buggy function aims to extract the branch information from the stderr of a git push command and replace "push" with the extracted branch info. Additionally, if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is present in the command, the function removes those flags and their corresponding arguments.

#### Identified Errors
1. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` is incorrect for checking if the `upstream_option_index` variable has been updated.
2. Incorrectly removing the `-u` flag and its argument after finding the flag once.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the check for updating the `upstream_option_index` variable is incorrect, leading to the usage of an incorrect condition during the flag removal process. Additionally, the removal of the flag and its argument is not handled correctly, resulting in potential issues with command manipulation.

### Fix Strategy
1. Change the condition to check if the `upstream_option_index` variable has been updated correctly.
2. Modify the code to ensure that both the flag and its argument are removed only once, if present.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the flag removal and branch extraction correctly based on the provided test cases.
