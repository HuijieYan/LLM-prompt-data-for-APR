### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to modify a git command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument if present, and then constructing a new command by replacing the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch. The bug lies in the handling of the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, causing incorrect processing of the command.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because if the `--set-upstream` flag is present, the index of this flag (`upstream_option_index`) is stored correctly. However, if the `-u` flag is also present in the `command.script_parts`, the index of the `-u` flag overwrites the value of `upstream_option_index` obtained from the `--set-upstream` flag. This results in always removing the `-u` flag instead of removing the correct flag based on priority.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that we handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly, preserving the correct removal order. One possible strategy is to prioritize the index of the `--set-upstream` flag over the index of the `-u` flag when both are present. Additionally, we need to fix the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` to keep the correct structure of the command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly and maintain the expected behavior of modifying the git command.
