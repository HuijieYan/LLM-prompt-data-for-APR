### Analysis:
- The buggy function aims to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command script parts and then extract the suggested git push command from the stderr.
- The issues in the current implementation are:
  1. Incorrectly removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument.
  2. Incorrectly extracting the suggested git push command from the stderr.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs in the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument. The function is not correctly updating the script parts list after removing these options.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the process of removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument by correctly tracking the index and updating the script parts list.
- Modify the extraction of the suggested git push command from the stderr to ensure accurate retrieval.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # Find and remove the index of the option along with its argument.
    remove_indices = []
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        remove_indices.extend([upstream_option_index, upstream_option_index+1])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        remove_indices.extend([upstream_option_index, upstream_option_index+1])
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Update the script parts list by removing the option and argument.
    new_script_parts = [part for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if i not in remove_indices]

    # Extract the suggested git push command from stderr.
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument, as well as correctly extract the suggested git push command from the stderr. It should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
