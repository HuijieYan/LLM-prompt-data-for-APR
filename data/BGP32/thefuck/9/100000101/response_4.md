### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to process a git push command and extract the suggested upstream options. The function aims to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" flag and its argument from the command and return the modified command with the extracted upstream options.

### Issues
1. The code incorrectly checks if the index of "--set-upstream" is present and then overwrites it with the index of "-u". This results in always using the index of "-u" if both flags are present, leading to incorrect removal of the flag and its argument.
2. After removing the upstream option, the function tries to extract the upstream suggestion from the command output. However, the current implementation assumes a specific position in the split string, which might not be reliable if the format of the output changes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the logic for checking and removing both "--set-upstream" and "-u" flags independently.
2. Implement a more robust way to extract the upstream suggestion from the git command output to handle variations in the output format.

### Code Fix
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract upstream suggestion from command output
    output_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(output_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.split('git ')[1].strip()
            break
    else:
        push_upstream = ''

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above by independently handling the removal of "--set-upstream" and "-u" flags and implementing a more reliable extraction of the upstream suggestion from the command output.
