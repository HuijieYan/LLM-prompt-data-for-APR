### Analysis
The buggy function aims to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option from the list of command parts and extract the suggested command from the stderr. However, there are issues with how the index of the option is handled and how the push_upstream value is extracted from the stderr.

### Bug Explanation
1. The first bug is in the handling of the upstream_option_index. The if condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` should be corrected to `if upstream_option_index != -1` because the comparison operator is not `is`.
2. The second bug is in extracting the push_upstream value from the stderr. The current implementation `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` assumes a specific position in the stderr message, which might not always hold true.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the comparison operator `is` to `!=` for checking the index value.
2. Update the method of extracting the push suggestion to be more robust and not rely on a fixed position in the stderr message.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)
            try:
                push_upstream = command.stderr.split(':')[1].strip().replace('use', '').strip()
                return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
            except IndexError:
                pass

    return ''
```

This corrected version iterates over both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options and removes them if found in the script parts. It then extracts the push suggestion in a more flexible way from the stderr message. This updated version should handle the provided test cases correctly.
