The bug in the provided function lies in the handling of the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. The current implementation removes the option and its argument without considering whether they are actually present in the command. Additionally, popping the elements from the list based on the index can lead to incorrect removal of elements.

To fix this bug, we should check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options exist in the command before trying to remove them. If they exist, we should remove both the option and its argument accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' if present
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        # Remove the option and its argument if they exist
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract the upstream branch and replace 'push' with it in the command
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks for the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options before attempting to remove them. It also ensures that if the option is present, its corresponding argument is removed correctly. This implementation should now handle the cases as described in the expected values and types provided for the failing test cases.
