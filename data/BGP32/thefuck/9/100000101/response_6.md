### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument if present. It then extracts the argument from the stderr and replaces the push command with this argument. However, there are multiple issues in the buggy function:
1. The logic for finding and removing the --set-upstream or -u option is incorrect.
2. The extraction of the push command from stderr is hard-coded and may not always be accurate.
3. The replacement of the push command is done by replacing the first occurrence, which may be incorrect if push appears multiple times.

### Bug
The buggy function fails to correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. It then incorrectly extracts the push command from stderr, which may not always be reliable. Additionally, replacing the push command may not capture all occurrences.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument.
2. Dynamically extract the push command instead of hard-coding the value from stderr.
3. Ensure that all occurrences of the push command are replaced.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    push_option_index = None
    for index, part in enumerate(command_parts):
        if part in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
            push_option_index = index
            break

    if push_option_index is not None:
        command_parts = command_parts[:push_option_index] + command_parts[push_option_index+2:]

    push_command = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_command = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    if push_command is not None:
        new_command = " ".join(command_parts)
        return replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_command)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected version of the function correctly identifies and removes the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. It dynamically extracts the push command from stderr, ensuring the correctness of the extracted value. Finally, it replaces all occurrences of the push command in the new command.
