The bug in the provided function is that when searching for the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts`, if the first search fails, it will always overwrite the `upstream_option_index` variable with the result of the second search. This will cause issues when attempting to remove the correct index later on.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to only set the `upstream_option_index` if it is not already set. We can achieve this by using an `if` statement instead of just using `try-except` blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts. The function should now pass all the provided test cases with the expected variable values.
