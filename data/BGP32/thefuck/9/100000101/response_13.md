The bug in the provided function stems from the incorrect handling of the index when removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command parts. The error lies in the use of the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice in a row, which shifts the index unexpectedly.

To fix this bug, we should only remove the identified option once by changing the second removal operation to adjust the index accordingly. Additionally, we need to correctly extract the desired command from the stderr string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct option is removed only once from the command parts and extracts the desired command from the stderr string as expected. The function should now satisfy all the provided test cases.
