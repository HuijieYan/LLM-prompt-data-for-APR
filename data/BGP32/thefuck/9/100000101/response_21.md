The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and replace it with the suggested upstream branch obtained from the stderr message.

The bug in the function lies in how it handles the removal of the upstream option. The current implementation removes both the option and its argument by invoking `pop` twice consecutively on the same index. It should only remove the option itself, followed by its argument on the next index.

To fix this bug, we should modify the section that removes the upstream option and its argument. We need to ensure that we remove the option first and then remove its argument separately if it exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the option's argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)          # Remove the option itself

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the removal of the upstream option and its argument while generating the new command to push to the suggested upstream branch.
