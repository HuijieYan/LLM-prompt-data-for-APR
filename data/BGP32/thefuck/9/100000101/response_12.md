### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command and extract the suggested push command from the error message given by Git. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is faulty.
2. The extraction of the suggested push command from the error message might not be accurate.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of multiple try-except blocks for finding the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The logic to remove these options is also incorrect, as it tries to pop the same index twice, leading to potential mismatch.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command.
2. Improve the extraction of the push command from the error message by considering the correct error index.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find and remove the --set-upstream or -u options
    command.script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    # Get the suggested push command from the error message
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(error_lines) >= 3:
        error_tail = error_lines[-3].strip()
        push_upstream = error_tail.partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues in the original code by correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, and accurately extracting the suggested push command from the error message. This new implementation should satisfy all the expected input/output variable values in the provided test cases.
