### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to modify a git push command based on the error message received in the stderr output. It is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command, and replace the 'push' argument with the actual suggested upstream branch.

### Bugs:
1. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command is flawed. It incorrectly removes both the flag and argument without checking if they exist.
2. The extraction of the suggested upstream branch from the error message is incomplete and relies on a fixed position in the split string.
3. The return statement replaces 'push' with the extracted upstream branch without proper validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists before attempting to remove them.
2. Extract the suggested upstream branch in a robust way to avoid reliance on fixed positions.
3. Validate the extracted upstream branch before replacing it in the command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the following argument

    error_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.partition('git push --set-upstream ')[2]
            break
    else:
        push_upstream = None

    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream.strip())
    else:
        return None  # Return None if the branch suggestion is not found
```

This corrected function first checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exist in the command to remove them. Then, it correctly extracts the suggested upstream branch from the error message based on the content. Finally, it validates the extracted branch before replacing it in the command. If the branch suggestion is not found, the function returns `None`.
