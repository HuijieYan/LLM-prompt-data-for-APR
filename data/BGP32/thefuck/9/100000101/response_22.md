### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command passed in the `command` parameter for git push. It looks for '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command and removes them along with their argument. Then, it extracts the upstream option from the stderr of the command and replaces the 'push' argument with the extracted upstream option. 

The bug in the current implementation lies in the logic that removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and their respective arguments. Specifically, if both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present, the logic does not handle it correctly. Additionally, the indexing and popping of the elements from `command.script_parts` should be adjusted to remove the correct items.

### Bug Explanation:
When both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the command, the current implementation only removes the '--set-upstream' and leaves the '-u' and its argument untouched. This results in an incorrect modification of the command.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are correctly removed along with their arguments. Additionally, the popping of elements from `command.script_parts` needs to be handled correctly to remove the intended items.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            # Remove the argument of the option as well if it exists
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected function above, the bug related to handling '--set-upstream' and '-u' options along with their arguments should be fixed. It now correctly removes both options and their arguments when present in the command.
