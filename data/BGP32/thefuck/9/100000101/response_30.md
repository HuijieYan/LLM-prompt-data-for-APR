The bug in the provided function lies in the update of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The issue is that the second try block will always execute, overwriting the value set by the first try block. This results in the incorrect handling of the `-u` option.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value is only updated if it is currently set to -1. Additionally, the pop operation in the script_parts list is not handling the removal of both the option and its argument correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
      
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the cases described in the expected values and types for each scenario.
