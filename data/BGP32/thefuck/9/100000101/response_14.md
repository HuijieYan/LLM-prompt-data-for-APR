### Analysis:
1. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command script parts if present and then extract the branch name from the stderr to replace the "push" command with the actual command suggested by git.
2. The potential error locations:
   - Incorrectly using `is` instead of `==` for comparison with `-1`.
   - When removing the elements from the `script_parts` list based on the index.
   - Extracting the wrong line from `stderr` to get the push upstream command.
3. The bug is likely caused by using `is not` operator while checking for `-1`, resulting in the condition always evaluating to `True`. This causes both `-u` and `--set-upstream` to be removed in every case, not just when they are present. This leads to incorrect command modification and extraction of the push upstream command.
4. A strategy to fix the bug involves:
   - Correcting the comparison to `==` while checking for `-1`.
   - Adjusting the removal of script parts based on the indices.
   - Choosing the correct line from stderr for extracting the push upstream command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indices = []
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream'))
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_indices.append(command.script_parts.index('-u'))

    for idx in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-5].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `--set-upstream` and `-u` arguments are only removed when they are present in the `script_parts`. The correct line from `stderr` is now extracted to get the push upstream command.
