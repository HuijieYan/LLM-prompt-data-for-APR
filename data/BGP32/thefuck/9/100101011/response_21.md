### Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its argument from the command. It then extracts the suggested command from the `stderr` output of the `git push` command and replaces the `push` with the extracted suggestion.
2. The potential error location is in the handling of the upstream option index and the logic to remove the option from the command.
3. The bug occurs because both `try` blocks that attempt to find the `--set-upstream` or `-u` index overwrite each other due to the subsequent try block. This results in only the index of the `-u` argument being stored, leading to incorrect removal of elements.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check for both options separately and update the removal logic accordingly.

### Fix Strategy
1. Separate the `try` blocks to handle `--set-upstream` and `-u` independently.
2. Update the removal logic to remove the correct number of elements based on the identified index.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the bug by correctly identifying and removing both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the command, leading to the desired behavior in the failing tests and resolving the GitHub issues.
