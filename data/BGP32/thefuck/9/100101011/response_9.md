### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command and its argument, as they are concatenated automatically by Git. The bug seems to be with how the indexes of `--set-upstream` and `-u` are handled, leading to the incorrect removal of these options.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of multiple `try-except` blocks for finding the indexes of `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Incorrect removal of the found indexes due to popping them twice instead of once.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when searching for the index of `-u`, if it's found after `--set-upstream`, the subsequent popping of indexes removes the wrong part of the command, causing the incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Search for both `-u` and `--set-upstream` indexes simultaneously and handle them correctly.
2. Fix the popping of the found indexes to remove them only once.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        up_short_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if up_short_index < upstream_option_index or upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = up_short_index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function should handle both `-u` and `--set-upstream` indexes appropriately and remove them only once to avoid the issue. This fix should make the function behave as intended and pass the failing test cases.
