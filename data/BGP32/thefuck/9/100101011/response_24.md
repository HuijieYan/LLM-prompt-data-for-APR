### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, if present, before replacing the `push` argument with the suggested upstream branch. The bug seems to arise from how the removal of the options is handled, leading to incorrect output for the failing test cases.

### Potential Error Location
1. Incorrect handling of upstream option removal causing incorrect indexing.
2. Inconsistent update of `upstream_option_index` for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely stems from how the function checks and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Since it only removes these options but doesn't handle the arguments correctly, the indexing of elements after removal is incorrect. This leads to the `push` argument being replaced with the wrong upstream branch (`origin master`) instead of the actual one (`origin master`).

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the removal of both the option and its argument.
2. Ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is appropriately updated for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove option
            # Remove the argument corresponding to the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
   
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By correctly handling the removal of options and their arguments and ensuring the proper updating of `upstream_option_index`, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues.
