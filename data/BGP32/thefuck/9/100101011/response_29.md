### Analysis
The function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, then replacing the destination with the upstream branch suggested by git. The bug seems to lie in how it processes the command parts and extracts the suggested upstream branch.

### Error Location
The issue seems to be in how the code handles the removal of the flag and its argument, as well as extracting the suggested upstream branch from the command's stderr.

### Cause of the Bug
1. In the buggy code, when removing the upstream flag and its argument, it deletes entries at the same index twice.
2. The extraction of the suggested upstream branch from the stderr is done incorrectly, leading to the incorrect result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure the correct removal of the flag and its argument by adjusting the index correctly.
2. Improve the extraction of the suggested upstream branch from the stderr by utilizing string manipulation for a more accurate result.

### Bug-Fixed Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for flag in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            flag_index = command.script_parts.index(flag)
            if len(command.script_parts) > flag_index + 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(flag_index + 1)
            command.script_parts.pop(flag_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested upstream branch from the stderr
    suggested_push = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    push_upstream = suggested_push[suggested_push.rfind(' ') + 1:]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now the function should correctly handle the removal of the flag and its argument and extract the suggested upstream branch, as required by the failing tests.
