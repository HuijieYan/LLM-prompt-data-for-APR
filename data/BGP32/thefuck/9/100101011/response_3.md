### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `command.script_parts` by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present, and then extract the appropriate parts from `command.stderr` to construct a new command. The bug appears to be the incorrect removal of the flag and its corresponding arguments from `command.script_parts`, leading to incorrect concatenation when constructing the new command.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrectly removing the flag and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
2. Incorrectly parsing the necessary parts from `command.stderr` to construct the new command.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the faulty removal of the flag and its argument. The code attempts to remove the flag twice without handling the removal of the argument properly, leading to incorrect output generation. This issue is reflected in the failing test cases because the constructed new command is not as expected, resulting from incorrect removal of flags in `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct removal of flags and their arguments from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to correctly parse the required parts from `command.stderr` to construct the new command. Handling both aspects correctly should ensure that the new command is generated accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u flags and their corresponding arguments from command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        idx = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        if idx < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Remove argument following the flag
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        idx = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        if idx < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Remove argument following the flag

    # Extract the necessary parts from command.stderr to construct the new command
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correctly handling the removal of flags and their arguments in `command.script_parts` and parsing the necessary parts from `command.stderr` to construct the new command, the corrected version of the function should now generate the expected new command accurately as per the failing test cases.
