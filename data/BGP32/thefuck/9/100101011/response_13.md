### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is intended to process the output from a git push command and modify it to include the necessary upstream information.
2. The function tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them if found.
3. The variable `upstream_option_index` is initialized to -1 and used to store the index of the upstream options if found.
4. The function then extracts the necessary push upstream information from the stderr of the command and returns a modified command with the correct upstream information.

### Error Location:
1. The issue appears to be with the logic that tries to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. In the current implementation, if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, only the last one detected will be removed, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug arises when there are both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options present in the `command.script_parts` list. The function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect removal of options. This results in a wrong command being generated at the end.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for detecting and removing the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options to handle cases where both options are present.
2. Ensure that both options are correctly removed from the `command.script_parts` list to generate the proper new command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Determine the indices of --set-upstream and -u options if present
    upstream_option_indices = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    # Remove the identified upstream options from the script parts
    for index in reversed(upstream_option_indices):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    
    # Extract the push upstream information
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Return the modified command with correct upstream information
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the logic to properly handle cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
