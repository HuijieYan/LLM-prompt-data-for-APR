### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to manipulate the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their corresponding values before constructing a new command. However, the issue lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is handled and how the `push_upstream` value is extracted from the `stderr`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The issue occurs because the code does not correctly handle the scenario where `-u` flag is provided with additional arguments. This causes the index lookup to fail, leading to incorrect modification of the command arguments.
2. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` is done based on the assumption of it being in a specific position in the error message, which may not always be the case leading to incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic to properly handle the removal of `-u` flag with or without additional arguments.
2. Modify the extraction of `push_upstream` value in a more robust manner to ensure accuracy.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the corresponding value for the flag
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function addresses the bug by properly handling both the removal of the `-u` flag with additional arguments and extracting the `push_upstream` value in a more reliable way from the error message. This should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issues mentioned.
