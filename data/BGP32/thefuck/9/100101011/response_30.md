### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command input by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` options if present, and then replace the `push` argument with the value extracted from the stderr message. The issue seems to lie in the removal of the upstream options and handling the push target value from the stderr message.

### Identified Bugs
1. The upstream option removal logic is incorrect as it is not removing the elements correctly when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present.
2. The extraction logic for the `push` target from `stderr` is not accurate, leading to incorrect output.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of removing the upstream options and extracting the `push` target from the `stderr`. This results in incorrect output, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the issue related to removing both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options when present by maintaining a single conditional block.
2. Enhance the `push` target extraction logic from the `stderr` to get the correct value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines[::-1]:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.partition('git push --set-upstream')[2].strip()
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

By implementing the fixes mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the modification of the command correctly, as outlined in the failing test cases.
