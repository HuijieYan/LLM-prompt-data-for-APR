## Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to handle git push commands and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument before constructing a new command with the remaining arguments.
2. The function uses the `stderr` information to extract the suggested push command from the output of the `git push` command.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`.
4. The failing tests indicate that the function is not producing the expected new command, which leads to test failures.

## Error Location
The error lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is handled. The `upstream_option_index` is being incorrectly set to the value of `-1` by default. Later in the code, when attempting to remove the option, it is not being checked properly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is always set to `-1` regardless of whether the option is found in the `command.script_parts` list or not. This leads to incorrect removal of elements from the list and incorrect construction of the new command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. If found, remove both the option and its argument from the list.
3. Ensure that the correction does not negatively affect the extraction of the push command from `stderr`.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u options
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove both the option and its argument from script_parts
        command.script_parts = command.script_parts[:upstream_option_index] + command.script_parts[upstream_option_index+2:]

    # Extract the suggested push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Construct the new command with the corrected arguments
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument before generating the new command. This should address the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
