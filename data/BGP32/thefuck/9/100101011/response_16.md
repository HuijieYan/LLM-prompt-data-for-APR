### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a given git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It then extracts the recommended git push command from the stderr of the original command and replaces the argument accordingly.

The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, leading to incorrect results in the output command.

### Error Location:
The error lies in how the function attempts to locate and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The removal process and the subsequent manipulation of the command string are not correctly handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The function does not handle the removal of these options and arguments in a precise manner, causing issues with the output command, as seen in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument by improving the code responsible for locating these elements in the command.
2. Ensure that the command string is appropriately modified after removing the option and its argument to provide the correct output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now handle the modification of the git push command correctly and pass the failing tests.
