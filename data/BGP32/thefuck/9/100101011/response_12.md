### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function is meant to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command. It then extracts the suggested upstream branch from the stderr and replaces the original push command with this upstream branch.
2. The bug stems from incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable and improper extraction of the suggested upstream branch from the stderr.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect logic in determining the `upstream_option_index` and inaccurate extraction of the suggested upstream branch from the stderr. In the buggy function:
- The `upstream_option_index` is assigned `-1` initially and then overwritten by the index of `-u` if present, rather than checking both flags separately.
- The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` is unreliable as it does not accurately retrieve the upstream branch.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Separate the checks for "--set-upstream" and "-u" as two distinct cases.
- Modify the extraction method of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` to ensure accurate retrieval of the suggested upstream branch.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument

    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the `get_new_command` function should correctly extract the suggested upstream branch from the stderr and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
