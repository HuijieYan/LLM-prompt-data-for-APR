### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is meant to extract the suggested command for `git push` based on the stderr output.
2. The function searches for `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`, but mistakenly pops the same index twice if found.
3. The bug causes incorrect extraction of `push_upstream` as it includes the unnecessary duplicate removal of arguments `-u` or `--set-upstream`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove only the found option without duplicate removal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that only one actual index is removed if `-u` or `--set-upstream` is found in the `script_parts`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the removal of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options without duplicating the removal, allowing for correct extraction of the suggested `push_upstream`. This fix aligns with the intent of the function and helps it pass the failing tests.
