### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function aims to modify the command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, then append `push --set-upstream origin master` to the remaining parts of the original command.
2. The code has potential errors in handling the removal of the options and their arguments, as well as extracting `push_upstream` from the stderr.
3. The bug likely stems from not correctly updating the upstream_option_index after the first successful check, causing issues with removing the correct parts of the command.
4. To fix the bug, a strategy would involve ensuring that the correct index for the options is removed, then extracting the `push_upstream` correctly.
5. The corrected version should ensure proper handling of option removal and extracting push_upstream.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument as well
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options with their arguments and retrieves the `push_upstream` value from the stderr. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test cases pass.
