### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command to replace the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag with the actual push command suggested by git. However, the logic for finding and removing these flags is flawed, leading to incorrect results in the failing test cases.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command script parts.
2. Removing the elements at the found index without considering the corresponding element for the flag.
3. Extracting the suggested push command from the stderr without proper parsing.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument from the command. This results in the incorrect push command being extracted from the stderr and the output being generated with an invalid format.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly identify and remove both the flag and its argument from the script parts.
2. Extract the suggested push command using a more robust parsing method from the stderr.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find index and remove --set-upstream or -u with argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract suggested push command
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes improved logic for finding and removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag and its argument. It also extracts the correct suggested push command from the stderr for generating the output.
