### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present, and replacing the `push` argument with the remote branch suggested by git. However, the function fails to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag, leading to incorrect output and failing tests.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the `command.script_parts`. When trying to remove the flag, the function incorrectly removes the flag and its argument separately instead of removing them together. This causes the subsequent indexing and argument replacement to be inaccurate, resulting in incorrect output. Additionally, the `push_upstream` extraction from `command.stderr` is not aligned with the expected output.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the function should correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its corresponding argument together. Then, accurately extract the `push_upstream` information from the correct part of `command.stderr`. These modifications will ensure that the corrected version of the function accurately modifies the git push command as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)
            if idx < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the argument
    
    remote_branch_line = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]  # Get the relevant line
    if ':' in remote_branch_line:
        push_upstream = remote_branch_line.split(':')[1].strip()  # Extract the branch
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return command.script
```

By properly handling the removal of the flag and argument, along with correct extraction of the remote branch information from `command.stderr`, the corrected version of the function is more robust and should pass the failing tests.
