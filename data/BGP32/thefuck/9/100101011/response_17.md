### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`, then extract the correct `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` and return a new command with `push_upstream`.
2. The bug seems to be in handling the removal of the options and their arguments from `command.script_parts`.
3. The failing test provides commands with various combinations of options and demonstrates the expected output based on the `command.stderr`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The code logic for determining `upstream_option_index` is not correctly handled for both cases. Additionally, when removing the options and their argument, the code skips every other index, leading to an incorrect modification of `command.script_parts`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases to find the index of the options in `command.script_parts`.
2. When removing the options and their argument, ensure that it is done correctly without skipping indices.
3. Modify the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` to ensure the correct value is obtained.
4. Adjust the logic to create the new command by replacing the correct argument.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the removal of options and their arguments and correctly generate the new command based on the `push_upstream` value. This version should pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue.
