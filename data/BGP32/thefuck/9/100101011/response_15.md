### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which aims to manipulate the command passed to it by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replacing the `push` argument with the correct argument obtained from the `stderr` output.
2. The potential error locations could be the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and possibly an issue with parsing the correct `push` argument from the `stderr`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect index manipulation while trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. Additionally, the parsing of `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` might include additional characters that need to be filtered out.
4. To fix the bug, we need to accurately identify and remove both the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. Additionally, the parsing of the correct `push` argument should be done carefully to avoid including unwanted characters.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace('hub', 'git')
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the issues with index manipulation and parsing the correct `push_upstream` value from the `stderr`. It also handles cases where the `stderr` output might contain additional unwanted characters.
