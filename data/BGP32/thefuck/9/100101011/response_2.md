### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. Then, it extracts the suggested command from the `stderr` message of the original `git push` command and replaces the destination repository with the extracted value.

The problem lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is handled and how the `push_upstream` value is extracted. The logic for finding and handling the options is incorrect, resulting in an incorrect final command.

### Cause of the Bug
1. When searching for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, the code treats both conditions independently. This leads to incorrect handling if both options are present.
2. Extracting the `push_upstream` directly from the `stderr` message without proper parsing results in capturing incorrect values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the search for the options to handle both cases correctly.
2. Parse the `stderr` message more accurately to extract the intended `push_upstream` value.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract the suggested command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options along with their arguments. It accurately extracts the correct suggested command from the `stderr` message, ensuring that the final command is constructed correctly.
