### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `git push` command and replace it with the correct upstream branch suggested by Git.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `upstream_option_index` is determined and subsequently used to modify the command.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the command is not correctly modified when the `-u` argument is present in different positions within the command.
4. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the behavior of the function has changed due to a recent merge (probably the one mentioned in issue #538).
5. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of multiple possible positions for the `-u` argument within the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the way the `upstream_option_index` is determined and used to remove the argument and its value from the `command.script_parts`. 
- The function only removes the argument at the index found, but does not consider the position of the value associated with that argument. This results in incorrect modification of the command.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Instead of just removing the argument at the found index, we should also remove the value associated with that argument at the index+1 to ensure correct modification of the command.
- Additionally, we should consider cases where the argument and the value are split into separate elements in the `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By popping the value associated with the argument as well, we ensure that the `get_new_command` function correctly handles the removal of the `-u` argument and its value from the `command.script_parts`. This fix will address the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to suggestion modification for `git push -u`.
