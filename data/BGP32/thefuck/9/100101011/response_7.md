### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to modify the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument if present since these are already included in the suggested command by git. However, the current implementation is flawed as it does not handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is incorrect.

### Error Locations
1. Handling of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags simultaneously.
2. Extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr`.

### Cause of the Bug
- The `push_upstream` extraction relies on a hardcoded incorrect index in the split output of `command.stderr`, leading to the wrong output.
- The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument is flawed, especially when both flags are present.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the logic to correctly extract `push_upstream` from `command.stderr`.
2. Update the logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly by considering both cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Correctly extract push_upstream from command.stderr
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = [line.partition('git ')[2] for line in lines if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream')][0]

    # Handle both --set-upstream and -u flags correctly
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        command_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        command_parts.remove('-u')

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The updated function ensures correct extraction of `push_upstream` and handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly, addressing the issues identified in the buggy function.
