### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command passed to it, removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument if present. The function then extracts the command suggested by git from the error message and replaces the `push` argument in the original command with this suggestion.

The bug seems to be in handling the indexes of the upstream options when removing them, as well as in correctly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the error message.

### Bug Identification:
1. The variable `upstream_option_index` is not correctly updated when searching for the index of `-u`.
2. When removing the upstream option and its argument from `command.script_parts`, incorrect indices are used.
3. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the error message may not consider all possible cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of the upstream option indexes, leading to removal errors in the command parts when removing those options. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the error message may not be accurate, causing incorrect output commands.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly update the `upstream_option_index` for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`.
2. Use the correct indices when removing the upstream option and its argument.
3. Ensure the extraction of the `push_upstream` value is accurate, possibly by improving the parsing method from the error message.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    # Remove the upstream option and its argument
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the git push suggested command from the error message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the 'push' argument in the original command with the suggested command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures the correct handling of the upstream option removal and accurate extraction of the `push_upstream` value, fixing the bug and making the function behave as intended.
