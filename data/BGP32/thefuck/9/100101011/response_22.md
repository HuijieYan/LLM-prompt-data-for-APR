### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command based on the output of the `git push` command. It searches for `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the command and removes them before constructing the new command. However, there are issues with how it handles the indexes and removes the arguments.

### Issues
1. The index removal logic for `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags is flawed, always removing the same index twice.
2. The extraction of the `push_upstream` is not accurately parsing the output to get the necessary data.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by erroneously removing the same index twice for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags, leading to incorrect command construction. Additionally, the extraction logic for `push_upstream` is not working as intended, resulting in incorrect suggestions.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Adjust the logic for removing the flags to properly delete the correct index only once.
2. Update the extraction of `push_upstream` to correctly partition and retrieve the necessary information.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the flag
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by correctly handling the removal of the flags and their arguments, as well as refining the extraction of `push_upstream` to ensure the correct command construction based on the `git push` output.
