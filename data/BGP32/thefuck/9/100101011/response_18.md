### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` flag from the command's arguments and replace it with the remote branch specified in the output. However, the implementation is flawed in handling the removal of the flag and its argument.
2. The method tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command arguments and then remove them. It also extracts the remote branch information from the command's stderr.
3. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` flag and its argument; the current implementation removes the same index twice and doesn't properly account for the argument's removal.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the argument associated with the `--set-upstream` flag and replace it with the remote branch extracted from the stderr.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, we need to update the removal of the flag and its associated argument properly. Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index and not command.script_parts[upstream_option_index].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the remote branch information
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the argument with the remote branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fix ensures that the associated argument with the `--set-upstream` flag is correctly removed from the command, and the remote branch information is correctly extracted from the stderr to replace the removed argument.

By applying this fix, the `get_new_command` function should now handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly and provide the expected output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
