### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument and then replacing the `push` argument with the suggested remote and branch values extracted from the `stderr` of the `git push` command. However, the bug occurs in correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `script_parts`.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is being overwritten instead of checked for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. The removal of the option and argument from `script_parts` is incorrect.
3. The extraction of the suggested remote and branch from `stderr` is hardcoded and does not handle variations.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from only considering one of the options while looking for the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, leading to inconsistencies in removing the correct elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the hardcoded extraction of the suggested remote and branch from `stderr` without proper parsing results in incorrect output values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic to check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options to avoid overwriting the variable.
2. Properly remove the identified option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
3. Introduce a more robust method to extract the remote and branch from `stderr` to handle different formats.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for both --set-upstream and -u options
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument from script_parts
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check for argument availability
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract remote and branch from stderr
    lines = command.stderr.splitlines()
    push_upstream = None
    for line in reversed(lines):
        if line.startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git push --set-upstream')[2].strip()
            break
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the function as shown above, the identified issues in identifying and removing the options correctly and extracting the remote and branch values should be resolved, making the function work as intended and passing the failing tests.
