### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments and then replace the `push` argument with the correct upstream. However, the current implementation has a bug where it tries to remove the `-u` argument twice and does not handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present correctly.

### Identified Bug
The bug lies in the removal of the `-u` argument where it is being removed twice if present, leading to incorrect modifications in the final command.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises because the code removes the element at `upstream_option_index` twice without properly handling the case when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present. This results in incorrect modification of the command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present, we should only remove them once from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to adjust the way we extract the `push_upstream` string to account for different messages in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is necessary as the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            break  # Exit loop after finding and removing the option
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Extract upstream information from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and extract the correct `push_upstream` information from the stderr. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issues mentioned.
