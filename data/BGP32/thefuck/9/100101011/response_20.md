### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle Git push commands by modifying the script parts based on the stderr output. The function aims to extract the necessary information from the stderr to create a new command. However, the issue seems to stem from incorrectly identifying the position of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag within the command's parts.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of retrieving the index of the upstream option.
2. Incorrectly extracting the required information for the new command from `stderr`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option index. This leads to popping out the wrong parts from the command's script, resulting in an incorrect new command being generated. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `stderr` does not accurately provide the intended value.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is identified.
2. Retrieve the necessary information accurately from `stderr` to form the new command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script:
        upstream_option_index = command.script.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script:
        upstream_option_index = command.script.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After making these corrections, the function should handle the Git push commands accurately based on the given stderr information. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
