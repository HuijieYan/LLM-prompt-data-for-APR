### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`. The buggy function is designed to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command arguments and then extract the new command suggested by git from the stderr. However, the logic to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is incorrect, leading to the IndexError.

### Bug cause:
1. The current implementation of removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` does not consider the case where both options might be present in the command, leading to incorrect pop operations.
2. When an option is removed from `command.script_parts`, the subsequent indexes of elements change, causing the second pop operation to access an out-of-range index.

### Fix strategy:
1. Correctly identify and remove both `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command arguments.
2. Update the index position after the first removal to avoid an IndexError.

### Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
            break  # Exit the loop if found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected version above, both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, along with their arguments, are properly removed from the command arguments. This modification should resolve the IndexError issue and produce the expected behavior for the provided failing test case.
