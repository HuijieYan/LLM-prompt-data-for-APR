### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to extract the new command for `git push` based on the stderr output and the original command. The bug occurs when trying to handle `git push -u` commands, where it fails to remove the `-u` option from the command and causes an `IndexError`.

### Error Cause:
- The bug arises from the incorrect removal of the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. 
- When `-u` is found in the command, it is not being removed correctly, leading to an incorrect indexing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are correctly handled and removed from the command.
2. Update the logic to handle both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately.
3. Make sure to handle the case where the current branch has no upstream branch.
4. Refactor the code to be more robust and prevent any index out of range errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly without causing an index out of range error. This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function works as intended for both cases.
