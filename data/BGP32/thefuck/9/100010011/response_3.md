### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with its argument if present. The function then extracts the suggested command from the stderr output and replaces the `push` argument with the extracted one.

The error message in the failing test indicates an `IndexError` when attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` flag from the `command.script_parts`, specifically when `-u` is used as an option.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is when trying to remove the `upstream_option_index` index twice, leading to an `IndexError` due to the modification of the list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are used together, the `upstream_option_index` is set to the index of `-u` after setting it to the index of `--set-upstream`. When attempting to remove the element from the list at the `-u` index, it has already been removed by the previous attempt, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the element once, either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, whichever is found first, to avoid the double removal and subsequent `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, only one removal operation is performed for the identified option. This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly for the given test cases.
