### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the git push command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags if present, then replace the `push` argument with the suggested upstream branch. The error in the function is triggered by trying to pop an index that is potentially out of range, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Potential Error:
The error is caused by popping the same index twice from `command.script_parts`, which can lead to an `IndexError` if the index is out of range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the code trying to `pop` the same index `upstream_option_index` twice without checking if the index is valid or within the bounds of the list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should only `pop` the index that was found once and remove the redundant pop operation. Additionally, we should make sure that the index exists in the list before attempting to `pop` it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Updated condition to !=
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Removed redundant pop operation

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the condition to check for `!= -1` and removing the second `pop` operation, we avoid the `IndexError` when `pop` is called on an out-of-range index. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
