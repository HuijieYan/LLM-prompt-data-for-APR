### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where the `git push` command fails due to missing upstream branch and suggests the correct command to set the upstream origin.
2. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurs when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The cause of the bug is that the code was trying to pop the element from the list twice in succession, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index becomes out of range after the first pop operation.
4. To fix the bug, we should only pop the element once after finding the index using `pop(upstream_option_index)`.
5. By updating the code to pop the element only once after finding the index, we can resolve the `IndexError` issue.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should handle the `git push -u` case without causing an `IndexError`.
