### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is passed in the `git push` command. The function is trying to remove these options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, it extracts the suggested push command from the `stderr` output.

The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is raised when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. This occurs when the index is out of range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to erroneously pop the same index twice in case the `-u` option is present. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements that do not exist in the list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is removed only once from the `command.script_parts` list. We should also adjust the extraction of the push upstream command from the `stderr` output to avoid any issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Adjusting the index to pop the next element
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the removal of the `-u` option and its argument if present. It also adjusts the extraction of the push upstream command to avoid issues. This should resolve the `IndexError` and pass the failing test case.
