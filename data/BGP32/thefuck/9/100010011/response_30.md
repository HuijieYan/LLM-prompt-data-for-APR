### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to handle the `git push` command by extracting the suggested command from the stderr output and replacing the `push` argument with the extracted upstream branch. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the command parts.

The error message indicates an IndexError in the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line, where the index is out of range. This happens when both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are not found in the command parts but the `pop` function is still called.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to remove both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options regardless of whether they exist in the command parts. If the options are not present, the index becomes out of range when trying to remove non-existing elements from the list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are not found separately. We should only attempt to remove an option if it exists in the command parts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = None
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of each option separately and only removes them if found in the command parts. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure the function works correctly for different input cases.
