### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle the case when `git push` command is used with the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag, by removing these flags and their arguments before suggesting a new command. The bug seems to be related to the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` list, as indicated by the error message "IndexError: pop index out of range".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The removal of elements using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is causing the error.
2. Incorrect handling of checking the presence of `-u` flag in the command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the code removing elements at the same index twice when the `-u` flag is present. This leads to an `IndexError` as the script tries to remove the same index which no longer exists due to the previous pop operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we remove the element at `upstream_option_index` only once and update the check for the presence of `-u` flag to handle it correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = None
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is valid after pop operation
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes handling the presence of `-u` flag correctly and ensures that the index is valid before popping an element. This should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work correctly as intended.
