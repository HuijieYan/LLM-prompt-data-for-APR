### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to extract the remote branch name to push to from the error message in the `stderr`. It also attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command to be executed. The bug occurs when trying to remove the obtained index twice, which leads to an `IndexError`. The error message indicates that the index is out of range.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the removal of the `upstream_option_index` after it has been used to fetch the remote branch name.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function first checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` and then for `-u`, but both conditions handle the removal of the index independently. This causes the second removal to operate based on the updated index, which could be out of range.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the index removal operation is performed only once for the identified `upstream_option_index`. This can be achieved by handling the removal within a single conditional block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By combining the removal of the index and extraction of the remote branch name within the same conditional block, the bug causing the `IndexError` should be resolved.
