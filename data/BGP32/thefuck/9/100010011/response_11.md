### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle `git push` commands by extracting the remote and branch information from the error message. The function removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and then constructs a new command based on the extracted information.

### Errors:
1. The buggy function is trying to pop an element twice from `command.script_parts` after finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. This causes an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when the function is called with `git push -u`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts` list. After removing it once, the function attempts to remove it again, causing the list to be empty.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove the option once from the `command.script_parts` list. This can be achieved by adding an additional condition to check if the index has already been removed before trying to remove it again.

### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if the index is not out of range before popping again
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function should now handle the `git push -u` command correctly without throwing an IndexError.
