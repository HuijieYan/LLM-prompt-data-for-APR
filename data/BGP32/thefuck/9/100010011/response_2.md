### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to handle git push commands and remove the --set-upstream or -u options along with their arguments from the command before suggesting a new command based on the error message. The error occurs when trying to pop the same index twice, leading to an IndexError.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, where the `upstream_option_index` is being used twice.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `upstream_option_index` is determined correctly when identifying the --set-upstream or -u options, but when attempting to pop these indexes, both `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` are being called consecutively without reevaluating the second pop index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the second pop operation and only pop the index once. This will ensure that the operation does not lead to an IndexError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments and avoid the IndexError that occurred in the previous version.
