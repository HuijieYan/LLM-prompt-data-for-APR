### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the following message: `IndexError: pop index out of range`. This error occurs when trying to pop an element from a list using an index that is out of bounds of the list.

The buggy function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. However, the implementation has a flaw where it is trying to remove the same index twice, leading to the `pop index out of range` error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list. This happens when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. In this scenario, the index is being popped twice, which causes an out-of-range error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index is popped only once and handle the case when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present, not both.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now the function will check for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, remove it once if found, and handle the case where either one is present. This corrected version should resolve the `pop index out of range` error and pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
