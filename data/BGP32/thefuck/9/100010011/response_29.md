### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to handle the case of `git push` output indicating that the current branch has no upstream branch. The function tries to extract the branch name from the error message and construct a new command suggestion with `--set-upstream`.

The error message provided in the failing test indicates that there is an `IndexError` raised in the `try` block for removing the element at the `upstream_option_index` in the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to remove the same index twice in the case where the `-u` option is found, leading to the `IndexError` for an out-of-range index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update how the script removes the element at the found index. We should only remove the element at the found index once. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` should be improved to ensure correct parsing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    # Find and remove the index of --set-upstream or -u once
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the last line from stderr for correct push command suggestion
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].partition('git push ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the case of `git push -u`, extract the correct push URL, and provide a valid new command suggestion.
