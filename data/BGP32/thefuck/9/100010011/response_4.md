### Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to generate a fixed command for a failed `git push` command. The function is supposed to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, extract the original push command suggestion from stderr, and replace the push command in the original command with the extracted suggestion. The error message from the failing test indicates that an `IndexError` is raised when trying to pop an index out of range from `command.script_parts`.

### Bug:
The bug in the function occurs when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the command, it tries to remove that option and its argument using `pop` method. However, it attempts to `pop` twice for the same index, resulting in an `IndexError` when the index is no longer valid due to the previous `pop`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. We should ensure that we only `pop` once if the option is found, and adjust the index accordingly to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is still valid
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Extract the push command from stderr
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None  # If no --set-upstream or -u option found, return None
```

By implementing these changes in the function, the corrected version should now handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly and generate the expected fixed command without raising an `IndexError`.
