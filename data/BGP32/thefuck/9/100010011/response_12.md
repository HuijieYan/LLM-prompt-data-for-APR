### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle the case of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from a `git push` command and retrieving the remaining command parts in order to replace the `push` part with the correct upstream. The bug seems to occur when trying to remove the `-u` option as the index-based approach for removing the elements is not considering the scenario where the option occurs more than once in the command.

### Identified potential error location:
- The error is occurring when trying to remove the `-u` option from the command.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the function is removing the `-u` element multiple times based on the same index, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop an index that has changed during the first pop operation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the `-u` option from the command. Instead of using the index directly, we can iterate over the script parts to find and remove all occurrences of the `-u` option.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    new_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function resolves the issue by correctly removing all occurrences of the `-u` option from the command, ensuring that the index doesn't go out of range. The function now iterates over the script parts and filters out the `-u` option before creating the new command.
