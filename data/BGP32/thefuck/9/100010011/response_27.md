### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to handle the case where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the `git push` command to suggest the correct command to push the current branch and set the remote as upstream.
- The bug occurs because the particular case of `-u` option is being handled separately after handling `--set-upstream`, which is incorrect and leads to an `IndexError` in the case of `-u` option.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the provided function is caused by not handling the case of `-u` option correctly. When handling `-u` option, both `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` lines are executed, which removes the element twice and causes an `IndexError` as the list becomes empty.

### Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix the bug involves:
- Checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately.
- Handling the case of `-u` option after handling `--set-upstream`.
- Making sure that if either of the options is found, it is removed only once.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After making these changes, the function should correctly handle the case of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `git push` command and suggest the correct command to push the current branch and set the remote as upstream.
