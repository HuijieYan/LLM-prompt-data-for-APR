### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and then extracting the correct branch information to use in the new command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` block where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line causes the `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list using the same index twice. When `-u` option is found, it removes both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments. The second `pop` operation without reassigning the `upstream_option_index` can lead to an `IndexError` if the list size decreases due to earlier `pop` operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second `pop` operation is only executed if the `upstream_option_index` is still valid after the first `pop` operation. Additionally, it's also better to check if the `upstream_option_index` is still within the bounds of the list before attempting the second `pop` operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function ensures that the second `pop` operation is only executed if the index is still valid and within the bounds of the list after the first `pop` operation. This should fix the `IndexError` issue reported in the failing test.
