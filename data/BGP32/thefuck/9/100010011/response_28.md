### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the command based on the stderr output of a Git push command. The error message reported in the failing test indicates an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from an empty list in the buggy function.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is where `pop()` method is being called on `command.script_parts` list. The error occurs because the code tries to remove an element from an empty list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `pop()` method being called twice on `command.script_parts` list when `upstream_option_index` is not found. This results in an `IndexError` because the list becomes empty after the first `pop()` operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if the `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before removing the element from the list. Additionally, we need to make sure that only one element is removed for the found index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Use 'upstream_option_index' again to remove one element only
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case should pass successfully without throwing an `IndexError`.
