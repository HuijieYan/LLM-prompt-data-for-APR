### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the output from a failed `git push` command and suggest a corrected command based on the error message. The function attempts to identify whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` option was passed in the original command, and if found, it removes these options along with their arguments. The bug occurs when trying to remove the identified option and its argument from `command.script_parts`, resulting in an `IndexError`.

The failing test is attempting to verify the behavior when the initial command includes the `-u` option, where the buggy function fails due to the `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause
In the buggy function:
- The `upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')` line searches for the index of `-u` in the script parts list, which can fail if `-u` is not present.
- If the `-u` option is found, the function attempts to remove it twice using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. This causes an `IndexError` because the value of `upstream_option_index` is used twice, leading to an out-of-range index on the second attempt.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check if `-u` is present in the script parts list before trying to remove it.
2. Ensure correct removal of `-u` and its argument by only popping once from the list if it is found.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
        
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        # Remove the '-u' option along with its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument if available

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function checks if `-u` is present in the script parts list and only removes it once along with its argument if found. By making these adjustments, the function should now handle the scenario when the `git push` command includes the `-u` option, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
