### Analysis:
The `get_new_command` function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command if present. It then extracts the upstream branch information from the error message and replaces the push command argument with it.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring when trying to pop an element from a list at an index that doesn't exist. This occurs when the function tries to pop the same index (stored in `upstream_option_index`) twice in the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the command, the function incorrectly tries to pop the same index twice when modifying the command script parts list. This leads to an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using two separate `try-except` blocks to check for the existence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, combine these checks into a single block.
2. If either flag is found, remove it and its argument from the command parts list only once.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments, if present.
    found_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            found_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if found_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(found_option_index)
        # If the option includes an argument, remove it as well
        if found_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(found_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the corrected function combines the checks for both flags and ensures that the index is only popped once if either flag is present in the command. This should resolve the `IndexError` and correctly modify the git push command.
