## Analysis
The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurred at line 27 of the buggy function. The bug is related to handling the `-u` (or `--set-upstream`) option in the `git push` command. The bug causes the index to go out of range when trying to remove the option and its argument from the command.

Based on the given function and error message, it is clear that the issue arises when trying to remove the `-u` option and its argument from the command. The function is incorrectly trying to remove the same index twice, leading to the index going out of range.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by trying to pop the same index from the list (`command.script_parts`) twice, causing the index to become out of range.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly remove the `-u` option and its argument only once from the command parts. We should also check if the index is valid before popping the element.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the removal of the `-u` option and its argument from the command parts without causing an index out of range error.
