### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and replacing the `push` part of the command with the suggested upstream branch. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` option and its argument if it exists.

### Error Cause:
The bug causes an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` that might not exist based on the presence of the `-u` option.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we check the existence of the `-u` option in `command.script_parts` before trying to access and remove elements from it. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `-u` might not exist and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Copy to avoid modifying the original list
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove option
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove option
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation:
1. The function now creates a copy of `command.script_parts` to avoid modifying the original list directly.
2. It then checks the existence of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and removes them if found.
3. By using the `script_parts` list for modifications, we prevent the error caused by trying to remove an element that does not exist.
4. The corrected function should now handle cases where the `-u` option is present or not without raising an error.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to fixing suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
