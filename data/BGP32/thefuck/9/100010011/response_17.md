### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring at line 27 of the buggy function. This error is caused by trying to pop an element from a list at an index that is out of range.

### Bug:
The bug in the current function is related to the removal of the `-u` argument from the command script parts. The function incorrectly pops the element at `upstream_option_index` twice which causes an `IndexError` when the second pop operation is attempted.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when we find the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream`, we only pop the element once. Additionally, the logic to handle `-u` and `--set-upstream` needs to be revised to correctly remove the arguments while keeping the rest of the command intact.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug by correctly handling the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument and avoid causing an `IndexError`.
