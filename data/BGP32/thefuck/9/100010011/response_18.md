### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle the command for `git push` by extracting the upstream branch and forming a new command to set it as upstream. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `-u` option. The error is an `IndexError` occurring when the `-u` option is present in the command.

### Issue
The bug occurs when the `-u` option is present in the `git push` command. The function tries to pop the same index twice when removing the `-u` option and its argument, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the `-u` option and its argument. We also need to update the logic to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Function
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument if present

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation
1. We updated the logic to check both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately.
2. We removed the second `pop` operation in the conditional block to avoid the `IndexError`.
3. We also added a check to ensure the argument for the option is present before attempting to remove it.
4. This corrected version should now handle the `-u` option correctly and form the new command without any errors.
