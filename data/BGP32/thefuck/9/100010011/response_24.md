### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the `command` based on the stderr output and return a corrected command. The function looks for `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `script_parts` of the command and removes them if found. It then extracts the upstream suggestion from the stderr message and replaces the `push` argument in the command with the correct upstream suggestion.

The error occurs in the following line:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is being used directly as the index to `pop` the element from the list, but the actual index should be `upstream_option_index - 1` because after removing an element from the list, the original index changes.

2. The script is using a wrong syntax check for the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1`. The correct syntax should be `if upstream_option_index != -1`.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Correct the index for popping the elements from the list by using `upstream_option_index - 1`.
2. Change the condition from `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index != -1`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version should now handle the index correctly and resolve the `IndexError: pop index out of range` issue.
