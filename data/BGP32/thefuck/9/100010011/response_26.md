### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the command for `git push` based on the stderr output of the original command. The bug occurs when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options are passed, causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove them from the `command.script_parts` list.

The failing test case indicates that when `git push -u` is provided as the command, the function encounters an IndexError while trying to pop an item from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because when the `-u` option is present in the command, the program tries to pop twice to remove both the `-u` flag and its argument. However, since it is trying to pop twice immediately regardless of whether the argument exists or not, it leads to an IndexError when the list becomes empty after popping once.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the target item exists before trying to remove it. Additionally, we should only pop the item once if it is found. This strategy will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if there is still an element to pop after removing the `-u` flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)        

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the case when the `-u` flag is passed correctly and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
