## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, then extracting the suggested command from the stderr message. The function tries to find the index of these flags in the `command.script_parts` list and removes them if found. The bug occurs because the function is removing the flag and its argument twice, leading to an `IndexError`.

## Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
- The function checks for the presence of the flag and its argument twice but only removes them once each time, causing an issue when trying to remove them again.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the flag and its argument are found, they are removed only once. Additionally, we should handle cases where the flag and argument are not present in the command.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function now checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list, and if found, removes them only once. This approach avoids the double removal that was causing the `IndexError`.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
