### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file, which is meant to manipulate a command for `git push` operations.
2. The function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command, and then extracts the intended push operation from the stderr message of a `git push` error.
3. The error occurs when trying to pop an index out of range from `command.script_parts`, resulting in an `IndexError`.
4. The bug causes incorrect manipulation of the command parts, leading to unexpected outputs and failing the test cases.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the index being popped from `command.script_parts` is valid to prevent the `IndexError`. Additionally, we need to properly extract the push operation from the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the length of `command.script_parts` before trying to pop an index to ensure it is in the valid range.
2. Improve the extraction of the push operation from the error message to get the correct information.
3. Update the function to handle all scenarios where the push command might include the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_flag_indexes = [i for i, arg in enumerate(command.script_parts) if arg in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    if upstream_flag_indexes:
        for index in upstream_flag_indexes:
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)
                command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[2:4]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug, pass the failing test cases, and provide the expected output values.
