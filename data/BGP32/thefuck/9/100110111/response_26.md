### Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to process `git push` commands. It removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command to avoid duplication. It then extracts the suggested command from the stderr message and replaces the original `push` command with it.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the index when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. This leads to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop elements.
3. The bug arises as the code assumes an index is always found for `-u`, leading to a wrong index in the case of `--set-upstream` or reassignment of the correct index when dealing with multiple calls in the same command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of finding and removing both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. Also, handling the case where no options are present should be considered to prevent index errors.
5. The corrected version of the function needs to accurately identify the correct index of the options before removing them and extracting the suggested push command.

### Correction
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        if upstream_index < len(command.script_parts) and \
                (command.script_parts[upstream_index] == '--set-upstream' or
                 command.script_parts[upstream_index] == '-u'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function should now correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and handle their removal. It should also take care of cases where the options might not be present to avoid index out of range errors. Also, the extraction of the suggested command from stderr should remain unchanged.
