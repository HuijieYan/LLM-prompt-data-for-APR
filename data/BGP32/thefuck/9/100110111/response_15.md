### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present and replacing the `push` argument with the output from the stderr message. The stderr message contains a suggestion for the correct git push command.
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the elements at `upstream_option_index` twice using `pop`.
3. The failing test cases provide different combinations of `git push` commands along with the corresponding stderr messages and the expected corrected git push command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting to remove the elements at that index using `pop`.
5. The corrected version should handle all cases mentioned in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list at an invalid index, which results in an `IndexError`. The bug occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is not properly validated before removing elements at that index using `pop`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `upstream_option_index` is a valid index before attempting to remove elements.
2. If `upstream_option_index` is valid, remove the element at that index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index+1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes a check to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is a valid index before trying to remove elements at that index using `pop`. By validating the index first, we prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy version.
