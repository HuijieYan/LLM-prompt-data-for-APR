### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags are passed in the command. It removes these flags and their corresponding argument from the command script_parts. It then extracts the suggested push operation from the stderr output and uses `replace_argument` to modify the command with the correct push operation.
2. The buggy function fails in cases where the `upstream_option_index` is not found (resulting in a default value of -1). This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.
3. The failing test cases reflect scenarios where the `--set-upstream` flag or `-u` flag is present in the command.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index`. If both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are not present in the command, `upstream_option_index` remains -1, leading to the pop operation failing.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if either flag exists before attempting to pop the elements. If neither flag is present, the function should handle this case appropriately.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the logic to first check if the `upstream_option_index` is greater than -1 before attempting to pop elements. If the index is -1, the function should continue without any modifications. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By including checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags before trying to find their index, we ensure that the function only pops elements when necessary. This modification addresses the `IndexError` that occurred in cases where these flags were not found in the command.
