### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is responsible for modifying the command given by the user in a Git context. The function aims to handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed and remove them along with their arguments before constructing a new command. However, there are some issues in the handling of these options, leading to the `IndexError` during execution.

### Identified Issues:
1. The function tries to remove an item from the `command.script_parts` list twice when encountering the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. This causes an `IndexError` when the same index is removed again after it's already been deleted.
  
### Cause of the Bug:
The `IndexError` occurs due to an attempt to remove the same element twice from a list in the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

### Proposed Fix:
To address the issue, it's necessary to ensure that the index is only removed once and then proceed with the code. Additionally, handling both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately will prevent any conflict when removing the index.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the modifications as suggested above, the corrected version of the function should be able to handle the given test cases and scenarios provided along with the expected input/output values effectively.
