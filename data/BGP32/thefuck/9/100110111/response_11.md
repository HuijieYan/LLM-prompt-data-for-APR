### Analysis:
- The function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments. It then extracts the push command suggested by git from the stderr and replaces the push part with the corrected one.
- The bug occurs because when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is found, the same index is used to remove both the option and its argument, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index twice.
- The failing test cases expect the correct modified git push command after applying the function to various inputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to fix the logic of removing the option and its argument by taking into account that both should be removed.
- Once the correct indices for the option and argument are found, we need to ensure that both are popped separately to prevent the `IndexError`.

### Updated Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto
    # the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Find the index of the argument to be removed
        argument_index = upstream_option_index + 1 if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts) else -1

        # Remove the option and argument separately
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if argument_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(argument_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the function correctly handles the removal of both the option and its argument. This should resolve the `IndexError` and pass the failing test cases.
