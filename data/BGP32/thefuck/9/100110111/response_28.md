### Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the `command` object by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument, then extract the command suggested by git from the stderr and replace the argument `push` with the suggested command. However, there are issues with how the removal of `-u/--set-upstream` and its argument is handled.
2. The error occurs when trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts` which may lead to `IndexError` since the code is removing two elements at the same index.

### Bug
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by trying to remove the same index twice from `command.script_parts` when `-u` or `--set-upstream` is found. This results in an `IndexError` when popping the same index twice from the list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update how we handle the removal of `-u` or `--set-upstream` and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Instead of directly popping the index twice, we should pop the index once, and then adjust the second index based on the removal of the first element if it's `-u`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u or --set-upstream
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != 'push':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument after -u
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of removing `-u` or `--set-upstream` and its argument in the `command.script_parts` list to avoid an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index twice.
