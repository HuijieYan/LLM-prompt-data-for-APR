### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments and replacing the `push` argument with the updated remote branch. The bug occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified but not properly handled when removing the indexed elements from `command.script_parts`.

The failing test checks various git push commands and expects the modified command to have `--set-upstream origin master` at the end.

The error message indicates an `IndexError: pop index out of range`, suggesting that the pop operation is trying to remove an element at an index that is out of range.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to pop elements inside the `if upstream_option_index is not -1` block without considering that popping one element affects the index for the subsequent element due to the list's shifting.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure we remove both the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and the following argument correctly from the `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by correctly handling the removal process after identifying the index of the option.

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return ' '.join(command.script_parts)
```

Now, the corrected function properly handles the removal of the option and its argument by considering the length of the `command.script_parts` list before popping the elements. This fix ensures that the subsequent pop operation is valid and avoids index out of range errors.

The updated function should now correctly modify the input git push commands as expected by the failing test cases.
