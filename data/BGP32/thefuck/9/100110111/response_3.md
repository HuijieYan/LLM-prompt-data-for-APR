### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `command` object by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments and then extract the recommended push command from the stderr.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect manipulation of `command.script_parts` by trying to pop the same index twice for `upstream_option_index`.
3. The failing test shows that the expected output is "git push --set-upstream origin master" regardless of the specific input variations.
4. The bug is causing an `IndexError` because the index out of range issue happens when trying to pop the same index twice.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `upstream_option_index` is found, it is only popped once and then continue with further operations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fix ensures that if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, it is popped from `command.script_parts` once. This change addresses the IndexError issue and should allow the function to return the correct modified command as expected.
