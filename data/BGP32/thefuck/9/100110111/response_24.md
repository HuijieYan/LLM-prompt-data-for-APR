### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to handle `git push` commands by identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. Then, it extracts the suggested push command from the stderr message and replaces the `push` argument with this suggestion.
   
2. The bug appears to be caused by mistakenly popping the same index twice for `command.script_parts`, resulting in an `IndexError`.

3. The failing test provides input parameters simulating different scenarios of `git push` commands with various options and arguments. However, the buggy function fails due to popping the same index twice, leading to inconsistencies between the expected and actual output.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we correctly remove the identified index only once from `command.script_parts`. We should also handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the code to remove the specific elements only if present in the `command.script_parts`, we avoid the `IndexError` from popping the same index twice. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and maintain consistency with the expected input/output values.
