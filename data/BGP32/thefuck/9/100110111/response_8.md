### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is assigned a value based on the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the `command.script_parts`. If these options do not exist, the index remains -1, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element at that index during the `pop()` operation (line 29).
2. The bug causes the function to fail for cases where no "--set-upstream" or "-u" options are present in the `command.script_parts`.
3. The failing test is due to the `IndexError` that is raised when trying to `pop()` an element at index -1. The expected output contains the corrected command with "--set-upstream origin master".
4. To fix the bug, we need to check that the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting the `pop()` operation.
5. The correction involves adding a check for `upstream_option_index != -1` before using it to `pop()` elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

By adding the check `if upstream_option_index != -1`, we ensure that the `pop()` operations are only executed when `upstream_option_index` is valid. This correction prevents the `IndexError` from occurring in cases where the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options are not present in `command.script_parts`.
