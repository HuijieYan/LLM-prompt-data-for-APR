### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the command script by removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` if present and replace the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch suggested by git.
2. The error is occurring when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list, likely due to incorrect indexing.
3. The failing test is checking various scenarios for `git push` commands with different arguments and expecting the correct modified command to be returned.
4. The bug causes an IndexError when trying to pop elements out of range in the `command.script_parts` list.
5. To fix the bug, correct the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present and ensure the correct indexing is used when accessing elements in the list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the index of the `upstream_option_index` is being reassigned incorrectly in the loop. The function is not correctly identifying the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and removes the wrong elements.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Remove the identified index once and adjust the removal logic accordingly.
3. Extract the correct upstream branch from the error message and replace it in the command script.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts  # Copy the script parts to avoid modification
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_index = command_parts.index(option)
            command_parts = command_parts[:upstream_index] + command_parts[upstream_index+2:]  # Remove the option
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected function should pass all the test cases and correctly modify the `git push` commands as expected.
