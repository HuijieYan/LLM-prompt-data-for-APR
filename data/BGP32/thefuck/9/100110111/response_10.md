### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the `command` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their corresponding arguments, then reconstruct a new command by replacing `push` with the branch name extracted from the stderr of the command. The error in the function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue lies in the following line:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The second call to `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` should be adjusted to correct the popping logic and avoid an `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the popping of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. In scenarios where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is found, the first pop operation removes an element, causing a shift in the list which makes the index stored in `upstream_option_index` invalid for the second pop operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second pop operation occurs after the first element has been removed successfully. Adjust the logic to avoid using the same index for popping twice.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly process the input commands and generate the expected output.
