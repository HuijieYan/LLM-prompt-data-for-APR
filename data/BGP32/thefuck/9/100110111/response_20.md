#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function aims to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command and retrieve the suggested push command from the stderr output.
2. The error occurs when trying to remove the elements at `upstream_option_index` twice without checking if the index is valid.
3. The bug causes an IndexError due to removing an element at an index that doesn't exist in the list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index is valid before removing elements. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' appears with other command arguments.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version takes into consideration the validity of the index before removing elements. It should now pass the failing test cases and handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options appropriately.
