### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a Git command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag along with its argument and replacing the `push` command with the suggested upstream branch.
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts`, causing an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test cases provide input commands with different variations of the `push` command and options. The expected output is to replace `push` with `push --set-upstream origin master` based on the provided stderr message.
4. The bug is directly related to the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command script. The IndexError occurs because the buggy code does not handle the case where the flag is not found correctly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is not found in the script parts. Additionally, we need to extract the upstream branch information correctly from the stderr message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before trying to remove the elements from `command.script_parts`.
2. Update the logic to correctly extract the upstream branch information from `stderr` message using a more precise method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()[4:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this correction, the function should now properly handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is absent in the command script, and efficiently extract the upstream branch information to generate the correct output command.
