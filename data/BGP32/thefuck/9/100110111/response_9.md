### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the input git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. It then extracts the suggested command from the stderr output and replaces the `push` argument with this suggestion.

The error occurs when attempting to pop the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list. The error message indicates an `IndexError` where the pop index is out of range.

The failing test provides different scenarios where the function should correctly handle the input and generate the expected output. The expected values include modifications to the original input command based on the stderr output.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. When the option `-u` is present, the index is correctly set to `2`. However, there is an error when the `--set-upstream` option is present as the index is set but not corrected in the subsequent if statement. This leads to trying to pop the index twice, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle both cases when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present. The `upstream_option_index` should be set correctly for each case and then used to remove the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop again to remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version ensures that the `upstream_option_index` is properly set and adjusted before attempting to remove the option from the command parts list. This modification should address the `IndexError` and allow the function to handle both cases correctly.
