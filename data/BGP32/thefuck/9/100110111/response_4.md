### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to handle the `git push` command and modify it if certain flags like `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the command.
2. The function extracts the value for `push_upstream` from the stderr of the command. 
3. The error occurs when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list, potentially causing an IndexError.
4. The failing test cases are based on different variations of the `git push` command with or without flags like `-u` or `--set-upstream`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect double pop operation in the script when removing the flag and its argument. Since the upstream flag and the argument occupy consecutive indices once one is popped, the other index goes out of range, resulting in the IndexError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the logic for removing the flag and its argument in a way that prevents attempting to pop an index greater than the length of the list.

### Updated Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index+1 < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if next index exists
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making sure that the next index exists before popping it, we can avoid the out-of-range index issue. This updated code should pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the removal of the flags and their corresponding arguments in the `git push` command.
