### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option along with the subsequent argument from the command. It then extracts the new command suggested by git from the stderr output and replaces the push command with this new suggestion.
   
2. The bug arises from directly popping the `upstream_option_index` twice if it exists without checking the length of `command.script_parts`. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` an index that is out of range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not verify the existence of the index found in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to pop elements based on that index. In cases where the index exists, it is popped twice without considering the current length of the list, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that the found index exists within the bounds of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to pop elements based on that index. This will prevent the `IndexError` that is currently occurring.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The correction includes adding a check to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is within the bounds of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to pop elements based on that index.

By implementing this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined.
