### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to modify the command based on the stderr output from a Git push command. It looks for specific options like `--set-upstream` or `-u` and extracts the branch information to append to the new command.
2. The error occurs when trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts` in two places which can lead to an `IndexError` because the index might not exist.
3. The failing test cases expect the corrected function to properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and extract the branch information to create a new command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indexes being popped from `command.script_parts` are valid and handle the case when those indexes do not exist.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to attempting to pop an index from `command.script_parts` without checking whether the index exists or not. This leads to an `IndexError` when a non-existing index is popped.

### Fix:
1. Check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before calling `pop` on `command.script_parts` to ensure that the index exists.
2. If the index exists, remove it once, not twice, as that will lead to index errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace('\n', '')
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version will handle the index pop issue and create the new command correctly based on the stderr information.
