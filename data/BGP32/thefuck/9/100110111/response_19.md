### Analysis:
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the command for git push by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present. It then extracts the suggested push command from the stderr message. The bug seems to be in how index removal for `upstream_option_index` is handled.
2. The bug occurs when trying to pop the same index twice, leading to an `IndexError`.
3. The failing test cases provide input commands with different flags (`-u`, `--set-upstream`) and arguments to test the function's handling of these variations. The error message indicates an `IndexError` due to popping the same index twice.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the logic for removing the specified index once correctly to avoid popping the same index twice, causing it to be out of range.
5. In the corrected version, we will correctly handle the removal of the specified index from `command.script_parts`.

### Correction:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
        except ValueError:
            continue

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version uses a loop to handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. It correctly removes the specified option only once if found in the `command.script_parts`. This updated logic resolves the issue of popping the same index twice, ensuring the function behaves as expected.
