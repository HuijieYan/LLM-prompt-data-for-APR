The buggy function has an issue with handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its associated argument. The bug stems from incorrectly popping elements from `command.script_parts`, and this leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element that is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument by only identifying the correct index once and removing both elements at that index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.rules import Rule
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return ""

    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The updated function now correctly handles the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list, and removes both the flag and its associated argument at that index.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that the failing test cases pass with the expected input/output values specified.
