## Analysis:
The `get_new_command` function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the input command and its arguments. Then, it extracts the part after "git" from the stderr message to generate a new command by replacing the "push" target with the extracted git command.

In the failing test, the issue seems to be caused by an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list using `pop`. This indicates that the index attempted to be popped is out of range, likely due to an incorrect approach in handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option removal.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the code incorrectly pops the element at the same index twice when removing the `--set-upstream` option. This leads to an `IndexError` as the index becomes out of range for the second pop operation.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix this issue, simply remove the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` that occurs twice in the function. Instead, use `del` to delete both occurrences of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.
Additionally, if the `upstream_option_index` is reset between checks, combine the two try-except blocks to avoid missing the second option ("`-u`").

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
      
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]
      
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the function should now work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
