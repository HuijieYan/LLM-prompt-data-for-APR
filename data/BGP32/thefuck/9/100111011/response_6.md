### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing it with the actual intended push destination. The bug in the function is due to the double `pop` operation on the `command.script_parts` list after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop again beyond the actual end of the list.

The failing test case is `git push -u`, where the function incorrectly tries to pop twice, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is removing the option from `command.script_parts` and then attempting to remove the argument related to that option. However, when it tries to remove the same index again as an argument, it results in an `IndexError` because the option was already removed, causing the list to be shorter than expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove only the option itself from `command.script_parts` without trying to remove the argument separately to avoid the `IndexError`.
2. Extract the correct push destination from the `command.stderr` content by splitting and partitioning the string to get the desired value.
3. Use the extracted push destination to replace the argument in the modified command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the option is removed correctly and fetches the push destination from the error message. This fix addresses the `IndexError` and should produce the desired output for the failing test cases.
