### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to modify the input command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. It then extracts the suggested push command from the provided stderr message and replaces the arguments in the original command with the extracted suggestion. The bug occurs when trying to pop the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `-u` option is found in the command, the function sets `upstream_option_index` to the index of the `-u` option. However, if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present, the subsequent check for `-u` will set `upstream_option_index` to the index of the `-u` option, overriding the previous index. As a result, the second `pop` operation tries to access an index that is out of range, leading to the `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function first checks for `--set-upstream` and only then checks for `-u`. This way, the index used for popping elements will always correspond to the correct option.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if element exists before popping
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the correct index for the `-u` option is used only if `--set-upstream` is not found. Additionally, it includes a check to verify the existence of the element before popping it to avoid the `IndexError`. With these adjustments, the function should now handle the input correctly and pass the failing tests.
