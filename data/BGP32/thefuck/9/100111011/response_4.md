## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its corresponding argument from the command's parts. It then extracts the push action suggested by Git from the stderr and replaces the argument `push` with this suggested action.
   
2. The bug occurs due to an issue in removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option in the command. Specifically, after removing the option, the subsequent removal of the argument results in an `IndexError` as it tries to remove an element that does not exist.

3. Considering the failing test case where the input parameter is `['git', 'push']`, the function encounters the IndexError when trying to remove the element at the same index twice, leading to the failure.

4. To fix this bug, the function should check if the `upstream_option_index` is not `-1` before trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. This will prevent the function from attempting to remove a non-existing index.

## Bug Fix
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is valid
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding the check `if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts)` before trying to remove the element at the index, we ensure that the index is within the valid range. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring and resolves the bug.
