### Bug Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function is designed to modify a git push command based on the stderr output.
2. The function searches for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command script parts, removes them, extracts the push reference from stderr, and returns a modified command.
3. The bug occurs when attempting to remove the '-u' option from the script parts, raising an IndexError for an out-of-range index.
4. This issue causes the failing tests related to commands with the '-u' option to fail due to the error.

### Bug Explanation
1. For commands with the '-u' option, the function successfully identifies the option and its index but incorrectly tries to remove it twice.
2. This incorrect double removal results in the IndexError for out-of-range index when the command script parts list is modified.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the code should only remove the '-u' option once when found in the script parts list. 
1. Adjust the logic to remove the detected upstream option and its argument only once instead of twice.
2. Ensure that the correct index is used when removing the option to prevent the IndexError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these adjustments, the function now correctly handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments, resolving the IndexError and ensuring the function works as intended.
