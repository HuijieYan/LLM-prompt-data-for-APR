### Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is intended to modify the command suggested by Git when no upstream branch is set. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of index while popping elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect pop operation in the if condition. When performing `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` followed by `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, it results in an IndexError because the list size decreases after the first pop operation. 

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that we only pop once based on the `upstream_option_index` if it is not -1. This ensures that we don't try to pop from the same index after the first pop operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After this correction, the function should handle the popping operation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
