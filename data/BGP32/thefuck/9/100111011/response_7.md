### Explanation:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect handling of removing the arguments `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list. The issue arises from trying to pop the same index twice immediately after finding it, leading to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range the second time.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we remove the argument found at `upstream_option_index` only once from `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by removing it once and then updating the index before attempting to remove it again.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and should now pass the failing test cases.
