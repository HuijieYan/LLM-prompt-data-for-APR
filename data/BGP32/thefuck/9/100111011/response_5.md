### Correction of the Bug

#### Analysis:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function causes an `IndexError` when trying to remove the `-u` option from the command script_parts list. The error occurs because the index is being popped out twice instead of just removing it once.

#### Correction Strategy:
To fix the bug, the script_parts list should delete the upstream_option_index only once, and the push_upstream value should be correctly extracted from the stderr.

#### Updated `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the script_parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the suggested git push command from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making this correction, the `IndexError` should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.

Please ensure to update the corresponding test cases to verify that the corrected `get_new_command` function behaves as expected.
