### Analysis:
- The buggy function is designed to modify the given git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option along with its argument if present. Then, it extracts the new suggested command from the stderr output of the git push command.
- The error observed is an IndexError when trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list. This occurs when trying to pop the same index twice.
- The failing test case involves the scenario where the command includes the -u option, leading to the buggy behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from attempting to pop the same index twice in the `command.script_parts` list when processing the -u option. This causes an IndexError as the index is removed once, and then an attempt to remove it again triggers the error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Modify the logic to remove the element from the list only once.
2. Adjust the extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr output to support varying cases where different options are present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there are additional elements
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    else:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)  # Return the modified command
```

With this correction, we ensure that the index is removed only once and handle cases where the push upstream command extraction is necessary if the --set-upstream or -u options are not present in the command. This amended function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the encountered issue.
