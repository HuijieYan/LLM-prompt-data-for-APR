### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to modify a `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag if present and updating the command with the correct arguments based on the stderr message.
2. The error occurs when trying to remove the two elements corresponding to the found index in the `command.script_parts` list.
3. The failing test is trying to validate the correct modification of the command based on the stderr message, but due to the bug, the index found is causing an `IndexError` when attempting to pop those elements.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario when the index for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not found properly to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not found in the `command.script_parts`, the `upstream_option_index` is not updated to `-1`, resulting in an unchanged value from the initial assignment and leading to an invalid index in the `pop` operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update how the script handles the case when the index for the options is not found. We can initialize the `upstream_option_index` to `-1` initially and only update it if the index is found correctly. This way, we can avoid the `IndexError` during the pop operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if the index was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making the above adjustment in handling the index retrieval and the subsequent pop operation, the corrected function should now handle the `IndexError` and pass the failing test successfully.
