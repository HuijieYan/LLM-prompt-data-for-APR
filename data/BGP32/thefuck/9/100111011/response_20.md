### Fixing the Bug

#### Issue Identified:
The bug occurs because when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are found in the command's script parts, both the option and its argument are removed using `pop` in the buggy function `get_new_command`. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index twice.

#### Proposed Fix:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that only the option and its argument are removed once if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are found in the script parts.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, with this corrected version of the function, the bug should be resolved, and the test cases should pass without raising an `IndexError`.
