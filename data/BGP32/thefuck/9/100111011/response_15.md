The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from trying to remove an index in the `command.script_parts` list without first checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop it out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the index being removed actually exists in the list before attempting to remove it. We can achieve this by checking if the index is within the list's bounds before removing it.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding the additional check `if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):`, we ensure that the index being removed is valid. This fix will address the `IndexError` seen in the failing test.

After applying this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test cases.
