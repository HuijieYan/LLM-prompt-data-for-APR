### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the input command as required for git push operations. However, there are issues with handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags. The primary problem arises in attempting to pop an element at an incorrect index when either of these flags is present. This causes an `IndexError` due to index out of range. Additionally, the logic to extract push details from stderr is functioning as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect handling of popping elements from `command.script_parts`. When the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found, the function should remove only that index, but the subsequent line incorrectly attempts to remove another element at the same index.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the elements from `command.script_parts` when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is detected. Instead of attempting to pop at the same index twice, we should only pop the element at the detected index once.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove only once
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags correctly without triggering an `IndexError` and pass the failing test cases.
