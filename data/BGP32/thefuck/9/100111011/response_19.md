### Analysis:
The bug occurs due to incorrect removal of the argument when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is detected in the command. The issue arises when trying to remove the argument as well, leading to an `IndexError` when there are not enough elements in the `script_parts` list.

### Bug Cause:
The `IndexError` is triggered because the second `pop` call attempts to remove an element at an index that no longer exists, resulting in the error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing only the option when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the command and not remove the subsequent argument without checking for its existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By fixing the logic to only remove the specified options and not attempting to remove the argument following them, we resolve the `IndexError` issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the reported issue on GitHub.
