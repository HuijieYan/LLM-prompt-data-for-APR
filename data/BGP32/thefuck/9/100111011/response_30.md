### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is failing to handle the scenario when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are used with the `git push` command. The function is attempting to find the index of these options in the list `command.script_parts` and then removing them by using `pop` twice at the same index. However, the issue arises when trying to pop the same index twice, causing an `IndexError`.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)`, the `command.script_parts` list only contains `['git', 'push', '-u']`, which means there is no occurrence of `--set-upstream`. The buggy function incorrectly tries to pop at the same index twice, which results in an `IndexError` due to the index being out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. The strategy would involve checking if both options are present or not before attempting to remove them. Additionally, we need to account for cases where only one of the options is present.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            # Remove the option and its argument if it exists
            command.script_parts = command.script_parts[:option_index] + command.script_parts[option_index+2:]
            break  # Exit the loop if option found and removed
        except ValueError:
            continue

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Applying this fix should prevent the `IndexError` and address the issue of incorrect index manipulation in the `get_new_command` function for the `git push` command cases with `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
