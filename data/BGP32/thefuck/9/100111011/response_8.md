### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the upstream option index. The function attempts to remove the option index twice, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to pop from the same index again if the first removal was successful.

In the failing test case with `git push -u`, the function wrongly removes the index for `-u` option and tries to remove it again, causing the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the upstream option index is only removed once. This can be achieved by updating the logic to remove the index for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options while avoiding a double removal.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1

    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass
            
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the `get_new_command` function, it should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u`.
