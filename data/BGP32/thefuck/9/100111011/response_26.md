The bug in the `get_new_command` function is the use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` twice. This causes an `IndexError`, as the second pop operation is trying to remove an element from the list that was already removed in the first pop operation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` only once, and then extract the `push_upstream` value correctly from the `stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Extract push_upstream correctly from stderr
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With these changes, the corrected logic ensures that the element is removed from `command.script_parts` only once. Additionally, the correct value for `push_upstream` is extracted from the `stderr`, providing the expected output for the failing test cases.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u origin` commands.
