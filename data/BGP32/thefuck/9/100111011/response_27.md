### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the script parts of the input `command`, as they will be later concatenated onto the suggested git command. The bug lies in how the removal is handled and the index used for removal, leading to an `IndexError` due to removing the same element twice.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` tests various scenarios where the script parts include the `-u` option. For each case, the function should remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the script parts before constructing the new git command.

### Bug Cause:
When the `-u` option is found in the script parts, the buggy code attempts to remove it twice by calling `pop` twice with the same index. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element that is already removed.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code to remove the found option from the script parts only once.
2. Adjust the handling of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options once when found in the script parts.
