### Analysis
The buggy function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option if present in the command and then extracts the branch name from the stderr message. However, the issue arises due to the incorrect handling of the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because after removing the first option at `upstream_option_index`, the second removal at the same index is incorrect because the list has shifted after the first removal. This causes an `IndexError` since the index is out of range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only remove an item at the specified `upstream_option_index` and update it correctly for the second removal to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '--set-upstream' or command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, with the corrected version of the function, it should handle the removal of the options correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
