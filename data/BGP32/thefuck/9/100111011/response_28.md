### Analysis:
- The buggy function is supposed to modify the command parts by removing '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument. However, the current implementation of removing both the argument and the option itself is incorrect and leads to an IndexError when trying to pop the same index.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the pop operation is causing an IndexError, which is consistent with the observed behavior.
- The runtime values show that the upstream_option_index is set to -1 initially and will remain -1 if the options '--set-upstream' or '-u' are not found in the script_parts.
- The failing test cases provide commands with variations of 'git push' and the stderr contains a message with a suggested command that includes '--set-upstream origin master'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function is attempting to pop the same index twice when removing both the option and its argument. This leads to an IndexError when trying to pop again after the option has already been removed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that we only remove the option and its argument if they are found in the script_parts. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to remove only the option and the next element after the option index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will only attempt to pop the next element if the option is found in the script_parts, preventing the IndexError in the failing scenarios.
