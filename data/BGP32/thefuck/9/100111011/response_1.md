### Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument from the `command.script_parts`, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to remove the same index twice.

### Explanation:
The buggy function does not handle the case where both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are present in the `command.script_parts`, leading to an error when trying to remove them. This causes the function to fail the test cases that involve removing the argument.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if both `-u` and `--set-upstream` exist before removing them from `command.script_parts`.
2. If both exist, remove them both and continue the processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        # Check if both -u and --set-upstream are present, and if so, remove the other one
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking and removing both `-u` and `--set-upstream` if they both exist, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the mentioned GitHub issue.
