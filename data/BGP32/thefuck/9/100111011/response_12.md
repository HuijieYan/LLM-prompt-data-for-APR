### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to modify the `git push` command based on the error message received in the `stderr`. It is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command and replace it with the correct upstream ref from the error message.
   
2. The bug occurs when trying to remove the corresponding index twice when the `-u` option is detected.

3. The bug is caused by incorrectly attempting to remove the same index twice when the `-u` option is found in the `command.script_parts`. This results in an `IndexError` as the index is already removed on the first call to `pop()`.

4. To fix the bug, we can check if the index exists before removing it, and only pop it once. Additionally, the correct upstream ref needs to be extracted from the error message, and the modified command should include this upstream ref instead of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option.

### Bug Fix:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Check if the index exists before removing
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

        # Extract the correct upstream ref from the error message
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition(' ')[2]
        
        # Replace the argument with the correct upstream ref
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return None  # Return None if the index is not found
```

By adding the condition to check for the existence of the index before removing it and properly extracting and replacing the upstream ref from the error message, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
