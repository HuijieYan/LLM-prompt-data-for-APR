### Analysis:
1. The function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and return a new command with the correct upstream branch suggestion.
2. The error occurs at the following line: `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. The bug happens when trying to pop the same index twice.
3. The failing test provides a command with `-u` option, and the expected output should have `--set-upstream origin master`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure we only pop the index once when removing the `-u` option from the command.
5. We will correct the function by removing the duplicate line that pops the index again after the initial removal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By removing the duplicated line, the corrected function should now properly handle the removal of the `-u` option and provide the correct new command with the `--set-upstream origin master` suggestion.
