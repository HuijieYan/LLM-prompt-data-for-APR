### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs due to the following sequence of steps in the `get_new_command` function:
1. The function attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream` in the `command.script_parts`.
2. If `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`, it will overwrite the `upstream_option_index`.
3. After checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, if either one is found, it attempts to pop elements from `command.script_parts` based on the found index. However, popping twice without adjusting the index can lead to an `IndexError`.

In the failing test case, the error occurs because both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in `command.script_parts`, causing `upstream_option_index` to be set to the index of `-u`, and then trying to pop elements based on the same index leads to the error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that only one of `--set-upstream` or `-u` can be handled.
2. Adjust the index accordingly when popping elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_long_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_long_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_short_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_short_index = -1
    
    if upstream_long_index != -1:
        upstream_option_index = upstream_long_index
    elif upstream_short_index != -1:
        upstream_option_index = upstream_short_index
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly identifies and removes either `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command arguments and adjusts the popping logic to avoid the `IndexError` observed in the failing test case. This fix should now resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
