### Analysis
1. The `get_new_command` function is intended to modify the `command` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if present, and then construct a new command using the remaining parts.
2. The bug seems to occur because the function attempts to pop the same index twice if the `-u` option is present, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Bug Explanation
- The failing test case tries to process a `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)` input, where the command argument is split and stored in `command.script_parts` as `['git', 'push', '-u']`.
- The function correctly identifies the presence of `-u` in the command and tries to remove it. However, when attempting to remove the second occurrence of `-u` by popping the same index as the first occurrence, an `IndexError` is raised due to the list index being out of range.

### Fix Strategy
1. The bug fix requires adjusting the logic in the function to ensure that the index removal works correctly for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` cases without attempting an out-of-range pop operation.
2. The function should correctly identify and remove the specified options without causing index errors.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove --set-upstream option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove -u option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove its argument if not last element
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Summary
The corrected function adjusts the logic to properly handle the removal of options and their arguments without causing index errors, ensuring the function behaves as intended and passes the failing test cases.
