### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the double removal of the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list in the buggy function. When the `index` method is used to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, it directly modifies the `command.script_parts` list and reduces its length. This results in skipping a necessary pop operation and causes the `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the pop operation is only performed once by checking if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before popping the element from `command.script_parts`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
