### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify the `command.script_parts` list and retrieve the push command suggested by git from the stderr message to generate a new command.
- The bug occurs when trying to pop the same index twice from `command.script_parts`, resulting in an `IndexError`.
- The failing test indicates that the issue arises when `git push -u` is passed as the command.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by attempting to pop the same index (equal to `upstream_option_index`) twice from `command.script_parts`.
- When `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag is present in the command, the index corresponding to this flag is mistakenly popped twice, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that each element is removed only once from `command.script_parts` when either `-u` or `--set-upstream` is present in the command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this corrected version, the function should no longer encounter the `IndexError` when popping elements from `command.script_parts` and should generate the correct new command based on the git error message.
