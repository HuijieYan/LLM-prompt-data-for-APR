### Analysis
The bug lies in the way the `upstream_option_index` variable is being used to remove the relevant arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. Since both `--set-upstream` and `-u` trigger the removal of the following argument, the conditional check to determine if the index `-1` is not the correct approach. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to remove the argument from an index that is out of range.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is attempting to remove arguments based on the presence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`. However, the logic to find and remove these arguments is flawed, causing the script to crash with an `IndexError`. The code does not handle the scenario where both `-u` and `--set-upstream` are present, leading to the removal of an argument twice.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to correctly identify the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream` and then remove the argument following it. Instead of popping the index twice, we can simply remove the argument at the identified index once.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Impact of the Fix
With this corrected version of the function, the logic to remove the argument following `-u` or `--set-upstream` has been fixed. The function should now be able to handle both cases correctly without causing an `IndexError`. The corrected function aligns with the expected behavior for the given inputs and should resolve the failing test cases.
