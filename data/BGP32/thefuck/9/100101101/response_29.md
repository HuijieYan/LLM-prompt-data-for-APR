The buggy function has a logical error in handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. The issue arises from directly removing elements from the list while iterating over it, which can lead to skipping elements or going out of bounds.

To fix this bug, we should first find all occurrences of the target options (`--set-upstream` and `-u`) in the `command.script_parts` list and then remove them. After that, we can extract the necessary information from `command.stderr` to construct the final command with the correct `push_upstream` value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()

    # Find and remove --set-upstream or -u options from the script_parts list
    script_parts = [part for part in script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split(' ')[-1]
    
    if push_upstream.startswith('git '):
        push_upstream = push_upstream[4:]  # Remove 'git ' prefix
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the options are removed correctly from the list before constructing the final command with the `push_upstream` value extracted from `command.stderr`. This fix should address the logical error in the initial buggy function and pass the failing tests.
