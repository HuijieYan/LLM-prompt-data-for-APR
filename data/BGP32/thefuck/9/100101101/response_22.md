The bug in the given function stems from two main issues:
1. Incorrectly popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list while handling the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The function should only remove the specific option and its argument, not both instances.
2. Incorrectly extracting the suggested command from the `command.stderr`. Instead of extracting the correct push command, it includes unnecessary information like "fatal".

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around removing the option and its argument while preserving others, as well as properly extract the push command from the `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u with their arguments
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Extract the suggested push command correctly
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that only the specified option and its argument are removed from the `command.script_parts` list while retaining other elements. Additionally, it correctly extracts the suggested push command from the `command.stderr`.

With these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected push commands as described in the cases provided.
