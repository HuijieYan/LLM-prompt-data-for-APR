The buggy function is intended to modify a git push command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, then replacing 'push' with the suggested git command extracted from the stderr output.

### Identified issue:
1. The variable `upstream_option_index` is incorrectly set with the last found index of either '--set-upstream' or '-u'. The subsequent logic to remove the argument mistakenly removes the same index twice, causing issues.
2. The extraction of the suggested git command from `command.stderr` is split by '\n' and might lead to unexpected results if the output format changes.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic to handle the removal of the option and argument properly by only removing once.
2. Enhance the extraction of the suggested git command to account for variations in the output format.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version loops over the possible options and properly removes the option and its argument once. It also uses `strip()` instead of `split('\n')[-3]` to extract the suggested git command, ensuring it works correctly regardless of the format.
