## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `get_new_command` function stems from incorrect logic when trying to locate the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags in the `command.script_parts`. The bug is causing the removal of the incorrect index and argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` is incorrect as well.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test cases, the function is failing to correctly handle the removal of the specified flags (`--set-upstream` or `-u`) from the `command.script_parts`. This results in the suggested command not reflecting the correct modifications.

Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is flawed because it is always fetching the value in the same pattern `-u origin master`, which is not correct.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the identification of the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` by checking both conditions separately.
2. Update the extraction of `push_upstream` to accurately derive the required argument.

## Corrected Implementation
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With these corrections, the `get_new_command` function should now handle the specified flags correctly and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
