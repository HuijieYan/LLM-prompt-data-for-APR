### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how the upstream_option_index is handled when searching for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. Both try-except blocks are executed regardless of whether the first try block succeeds or not. This leads to the second try block overwriting the value set by the first try block, causing issues when removing the upstream_option_index from the list of script parts.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second try block is only executed if the first try block fails. This can be achieved by using a conditional check to update the upstream_option_index only when it is not already set.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the code to handle the try-except blocks sequentially and checking if upstream_option_index is already set before updating it, we ensure that the correct index is used for removal in all cases. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
