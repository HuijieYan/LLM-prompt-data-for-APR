The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` lies in the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script before reconstructing the new command. The issue arises from the incorrect removal of the option and its argument causing discrepancies in the expected output compared to the actual output.

The bug can be fixed by updating the removal logic of the upstream option and its argument. Instead of just popping the elements at the found index, we should remove the option and its argument by popping twice to ensure both are removed correctly without leaving any artifacts.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By correctly removing both parts of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, the function should now produce the expected results for the failing tests.
