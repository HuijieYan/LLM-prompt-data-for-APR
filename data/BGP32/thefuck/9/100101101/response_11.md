The buggy function is designed to process Git push commands and remove the --set-upstream or -u options while extracting the main push command and its arguments. The bug lies in the logic to extract the command to push upstream.

The issue is due to the incorrect indexing and removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list when handling the --set-upstream or -u options. In the buggy code, when removing the element at `upstream_option_index`, the subsequent removal is incorrect because the index resets, leading to removing the wrong element. This leads to incorrect processing of the command arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we correctly find and remove the desired elements based on the detected option index. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check for '--set-upstream' or '-u' option index in the command
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    # Remove the option and its argument if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the next element exists
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the upstream command suggested by git
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the push command in the original command with the extracted upstream command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct option index is used for removal from the `command.script_parts` list, preventing misalignment issues. It should now pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values provided.
