## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a git push command based on the stderr output. It searches for '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command and removes them. Then it extracts the pushed branch from the stderr and replaces the 'push' argument in the command with the extracted branch. 

The bug in the function arises from incorrectly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. The bug is located in the following lines:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The code mistakenly attempts to pop the same index twice, removing only one element instead of both the option and its argument.

The failing test attempts to validate the behavior of the function with different input scenarios, but due to the bug, the function fails to produce the expected output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function `get_new_command`, we need to correctly remove both the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its corresponding argument. This can be achieved by popping the same index twice. We should also handle cases where the '-u' option comes after the branch name.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument if they exist
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By fixing the removal of the option and its argument in the correct manner, the function `get_new_command` should now produce the expected output in the failing test cases.
