## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command script parts. The current implementation incorrectly pops both the flag and its argument using the same index, leading to an incorrect command construction.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the removal of the flags and their arguments by ensuring that the correct index is used to remove them. Additionally, the function should properly extract the suggested push command from the stderr message.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of the --set-upstream or -u flag
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    # Remove the flag and its argument from the script parts
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract the suggested push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[-1]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the removal of the flags and their arguments and construct the correct push command based on the stderr message. The failing test cases should now pass as expected.
