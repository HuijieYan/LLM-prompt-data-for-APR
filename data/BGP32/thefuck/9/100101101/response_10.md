The bug in the provided function arises from incorrectly handling the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command script parts. The bug causes the incorrect removal of parts from the script, leading to misalignment and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we should update the code to properly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option by considering both cases and removing only the specific part that matches the option.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    new_script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        new_script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        new_script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that only the specific '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is removed from the script parts, allowing the function to generate the correct new command based on the provided input.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
