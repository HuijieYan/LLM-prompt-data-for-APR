### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the incorrect handling of the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`. The current implementation of removing these options directly removes them without considering the associated argument, leading to incorrect command generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the way the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are removed from the `command.script_parts`. We should remove not only the options but also their associated arguments to ensure the correct generation of the new command.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if option_index != -1:
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the associated argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By iterating over both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options individually and making sure to remove both the option and its associated argument if found, this corrected version should address the bug and correctly generate the new command as expected.
