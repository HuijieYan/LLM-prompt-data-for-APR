### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The existing code identifies the index of these options but incorrectly removes them from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the `push_upstream` calculation is faulty and does not result in the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument.
2. Correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` to ensure it reflects the final command with the expected branch.
3. Ensure that the modified `command.script_parts` and `push_upstream` value create the correct new command.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream_line = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]
    push_upstream = push_upstream_line.split()[3:]  # Extract the part after 'git push'
    
    return " ".join(command_parts + push_upstream)
```

The corrected function copy the `command.script_parts` into a new list `command_parts` and correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u`. It also correctly extracts the `push_upstream` part from the `stderr` based on the expected structure.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
