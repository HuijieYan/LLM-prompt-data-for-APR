### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument and replacing the push argument with the one obtained from the stderr output of the command.

The potential error in the function lies in the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The code is checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags separately but not handling the situation where both flags are present in the script_parts list.

### Bug Cause:
In the provided buggy function, when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the script_parts list, the code only removes the first occurrence of the flag found and its argument. This leads to incorrect behavior when the test expects the removal of both flags.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags are present in the script_parts list. Instead of searching for each flag separately and removing it, we can look for either of the flags (preferably `--set-upstream` because it is lengthier), remove it along with its argument, and then proceed with the push command replacement.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument of the flag
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking for `--set-upstream` first and then handling the removal of both the flag and its argument, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
