The issue with the current implementation of the `get_new_command` function is that it does not correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command input. Additionally, it assumes that the `push_upstream` can be reliably extracted from the stderr output, which may not always be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly detect and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the input `git push` command.
2. Parse the stderr output to accurately extract the remote and branch information to construct the new command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    
    # Detect and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    # Parse the stderr to extract the remote and branch information
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream ' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return " ".join(script_parts)  # Fallback to original command if push_upstream not found
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly and extract the remote and branch information from the stderr output to construct the new command.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided in the description.
