The buggy function fails to correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command.script_parts list. The key issue lies in how the code handles the removal of these elements. It currently attempts to remove the option and its argument by popping twice at the same index, which leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the removal of both the option and its argument should be performed separately at their respective positions. Additionally, the function should correctly extract the 'push upstream' value from the stderr message for forming the new command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        upstream_argument = command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    else:
        upstream_option = '-u'
        if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            upstream_argument = command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    # Extract the 'git push' command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle the removal of the options and their arguments correctly, leading to the expected behavior when determining the new command.
