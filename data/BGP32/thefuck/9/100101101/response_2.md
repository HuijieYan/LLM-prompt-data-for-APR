### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`. The script removes the option itself but fails to remove its corresponding argument if present, leading to the incorrect construction of the new command.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the parsing of the `push_upstream` value needs to be adjusted to extract the correct command suggestion provided by git's stderr message.

### Corrected Version
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if an argument exists after the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('    ')[2]  # Extract the correct suggestion
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the removal of the option and its argument, as well as correctly parsing the `push_upstream` value. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
