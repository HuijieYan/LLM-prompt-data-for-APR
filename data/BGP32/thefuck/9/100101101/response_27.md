## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the command's script parts. The issue is that when the first matching option is found, both the option and its argument are removed, but this leads to incorrect removal of elements from the script parts list. When removing both the option and its argument, the indexing gets shifted and causes inconsistent results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
One way to fix this bug is to keep track of the index where the option is found and remove only the option if found without interfering with the indexing. Additionally, the way the `push_upstream` value is extracted from the command's stderr is incorrect and needs to be adjusted to reflect the desired output.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it. This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By modifying the above code as suggested, the function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing test cases.
