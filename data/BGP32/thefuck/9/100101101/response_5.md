### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in how the `upstream_option_index` is handled. The intention is to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command script parts and then remove them along with their arguments before further processing. However, the way it is currently implemented is problematic:
1. If the `-u` option is present after the `--set-upstream` option, it will incorrectly remove the arguments for `--set-upstream` instead of `-u`.
2. After finding the index of the option, it erroneously removes the same index twice, resulting in missing the extraction of the correct `push_upstream` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the cases when both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present by checking their order.
2. Remove the same index only once after finding the correct indexes.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    command_without_upstream = " ".join(script_parts)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(command_without_upstream, 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

After applying these changes, the function should now correctly handle different combinations of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and provide the expected `push_upstream` value.
