The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from how it handles extreme cases where the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are close to each other. Specifically, when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small compared to the maximum absolute value between the two, it encounters overflow errors.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `nonsingular` function to handle these extreme cases more effectively.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if they are in the wrong order
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif not increasing and vmax > vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Use a different calculation for adjusting vmin and vmax
            if increasing:
                vmin = vmin - (expander * abs(vmin))
                vmax = vmax + (expander * abs(vmax))
            else:
                vmin = vmax - (expander * abs(vmax))
                vmax = vmin + (expander * abs(vmin))

    # Swap again if needed based on the increasing flag
    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the logic to adjust `vmin` and `vmax` in a different way if the difference is too small, we can prevent overflow issues as seen in the failing test cases. This corrected version should now resolve the bugs and allow the failing tests to pass.
