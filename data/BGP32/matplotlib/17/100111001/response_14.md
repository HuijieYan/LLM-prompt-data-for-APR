The issue in the `nonsingular` function lies in the computation of `maxabsvalue` where an overflow error is encountered. The calculation `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` can lead to overflow when one of the values is very large.

## Bug Cause:
1. In the failing test scenarios, such as when vmax = 20000 and vmin = -20000 (on the absolute limit of int16), the calculation for `maxabsvalue` results in a number larger than the system can handle.
2. This overflowing value then creates an error in the subsequent comparison, leading to the bug.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `maxabsvalue` is calculated to prevent overflow. One approach is to limit the calculation by considering the absolute values when dealing with very large numbers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin, abs_vmax = abs(vmin), abs(vmax)

    if abs_vmin < abs_vmax:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmax
    else:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmin

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs_vmin
            vmax += expander*abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By recalculating `maxabsvalue` based on absolute values rather than a direct comparison, we prevent potential overflow issues. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
