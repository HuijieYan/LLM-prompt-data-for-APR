### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, expanding or swapping them based on conditions.
2. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of endpoints when they are very close and result in overflow or runtime warnings.
3. The failing tests indicate overflow and runtime warnings related to absolute calculations and scalar operations within the function.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves handling extreme cases where endpoints are too close, triggering overflow or precision issues.
5. The corrected version of the function below addresses the overflow and precision problems by handling these cases more precisely.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander
            vmax = vmax + expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By modifying the handling of cases where endpoints are too close or approach limits, the corrected function aims to prevent overflow and precision issues, passing the failing tests.
