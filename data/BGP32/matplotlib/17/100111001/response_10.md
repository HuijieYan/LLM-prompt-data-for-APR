The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` causing overflow issues and resulting in RuntimeWarnings. The problematic line is:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

The issue arises when `vmin` and `vmax` values are very large, so taking the absolute value and comparing them leads to an overflow situation.

To fix this bug, we can change the way `maxabsvalue` is calculated. Instead of using the `max` function with `abs`, we will compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` separately and then choose the larger one. This way, we avoid taking the absolute of two potentially large numbers together.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = abs_vmin if abs_vmin > abs_vmax else abs_vmax

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should resolve the overflow issues and the related RuntimeWarnings encountered during the test executions.
