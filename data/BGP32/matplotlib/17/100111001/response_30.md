### Bug analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The issue arises when `vmax` and `vmin` are close, but due to precision issues in floating-point arithmetic, the subtraction operation may lead to an overflow error, which causes the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to avoid direct subtraction that might cause overflow. One way to achieve this is to compare the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with a small value rather than the direct subtraction. This would prevent the overflow error and accurately check if the interval is too small for adjustment.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander*maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the change to compare the absolute difference rather than direct subtraction, the corrected function should now handle the interval adjustment without causing overflow errors.
