### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by the calculation involving `maxabsvalue` where the values may exceed the limits causing overflow or encountering runtime warnings. This issue arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to zero or very small. Additionally, when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, conditions related to very small values should be handled carefully to avoid precision errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic dealing with the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent condition that compares `vmax - vmin` with this value. Adjustments need to be made to correctly handle values that are close to zero and prevent overflow or runtime warnings due to calculations exceeding limits.

### Updated Fixed Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the condition in the `elif` block to use `abs(vmax - vmin)` instead of `(vmax - vmin)`, we ensure that the calculations are within acceptable ranges and avoid overflow errors that lead to runtime warnings. This fix should correct the bug and allow the function to work properly with the failing tests.
