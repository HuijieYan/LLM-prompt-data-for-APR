## Bug Analysis:

The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to arise from the calculation involving `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`, leading to potential overflow in certain scenarios. Specifically, the error messages indicate warnings related to overflow when performing subtraction and absolute value operations.

1. In Case 3, the function incorrectly swaps `vmin` and `vmax` when `vmax < vmin`, then calculates `maxabsvalue` as `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. However, the swapping logic results in `vmax` being negative, causing `maxabsvalue` to become negative as well, leading to an overflow.

2. Considering the critical calculations around `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent checks on the interval size relative to the endpoint values, it seems that the calculations are not handling extreme cases properly, resulting in runtime warnings about overflow.

## Bug Fix:

To resolve the overflow issues and correct the `nonsingular` function, we need to adjust the logic around calculating `maxabsvalue`. One approach could be to determine the maximum absolute value without considering the sign of `vmin` and `vmax`. This can be achieved by explicitly taking the absolute value of each and then finding the maximum.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

This correction ensures that the absolute values are used consistently in calculating `maxabsvalue`, avoiding the overflow issues observed in the failing tests.

By making this adjustment, the `nonsingular` function should now handle extreme cases correctly without triggering the overflow warnings.
