The issue in the `nonsingular` function is due to the calculation involving `maxabsvalue` leading to potential overflow warnings, as evidenced by the failing tests highlighting overflow during subtraction and absolute value calculation.

The bug stems from comparing the size of `maxabsvalue` to `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. In cases where the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are relatively large compared to `tiny`, the multiplication `(1e6 / tiny)` creates a value that is too large, leading to an overflow when the comparison is made against `maxabsvalue`.

To address the issue and eliminate the potential for overflow, we need to revise the comparison condition in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. By considering the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` directly into this comparison without scaling, we can ensure a valid comparison without facing overflow problems.

Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Compare maxabsvalue directly against tiny to prevent overflow
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This correction aims to resolve the overflow issue and pass the failing tests by ensuring that the comparison against `tiny` is appropriate.
