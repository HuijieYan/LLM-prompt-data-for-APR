The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the approach to determining whether to expand the range based on the `tiny` value. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` may lead to incorrect calculations and potential overflows when dealing with large values. Additionally, the logic for handling infinite or non-finite inputs needs improvement.

To fix the bug:
1. Revise the `tiny` condition to compare the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints instead of using direct subtraction to avoid potential overflows.
2. Improve the handling of infinite or non-finite inputs within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) / maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        range_center = (vmax + vmin) / 2
        vmin = range_center - abs(range_center) * expander
        vmax = range_center + abs(range_center) * expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By implementing these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now be able to handle large values more effectively and avoid the potential overflows that were causing the failing tests.
