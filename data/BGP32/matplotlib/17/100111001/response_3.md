Based on the analysis of the buggy function, failing tests, error messages, and runtime values, it appears that the issue arises when `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the `max` function on `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`, leading to potential overflow warnings due to the input values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `maxabsvalue` does not cause overflow warnings. One way to do this is by replacing the calculation of `maxabsvalue` with a safer and more robust approach.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    range_size = vmax - vmin
    if abs(range_size) < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * 0.5
            vmax += expander * 0.5

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version:
1. `maxabsvalue` calculation has been removed and replaced with a `range_size` calculation using `vmax - vmin`.
2. The threshold check has been simplified based on the `range_size`.
3. The calculation for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` has been updated to ensure they are expanded symmetrically if necessary.

By making these adjustments, the function should now be able to handle a wider range of input values without causing overflow warnings.
