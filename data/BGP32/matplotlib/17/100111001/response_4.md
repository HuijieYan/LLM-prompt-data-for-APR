### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` aims to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain criteria. The bug arises due to an overflow error when calculating the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` in the `elif` block. This results in a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the calculation `vmax - vmin` can lead to an overflow issue when `vmax` and `vmin` are large absolute values. This overflow situation causes the runtime warning and incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculations that involve large absolute values to prevent any potential overflow errors. One way to address this is to consider the sign of the values to ensure the calculations are within the appropriate range for floating point numbers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    """
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax) - abs(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= np.sign(vmin) * expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += np.sign(vmax) * expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the comparison in the `elif` block to use `abs(vmax) - abs(vmin)` to prevent overflow issues.
- Used `np.sign()` to maintain the sign of `vmin` and `vmax` during the adjustments, ensuring correctness for large values.
