### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is supposed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, the bug arises from potential numeric calculation issues leading to overflow and an incorrect computation of `maxabsvalue`. The test `test_colorbar_int` is failing due to overflow encountered in the calculations within the function.

### Bug Explanation
In the function `nonsingular`, the calculation involving subtraction (`vmax - vmin`) introduces the possibility of overflow, especially when dealing with `int16` values like in the failing test. Additionally, the assignment of `maxabsvalue` is incorrect, which results in the wrong comparison in the subsequent `if` statement.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to address the potential overflow issues during subtraction and correct the computation of `maxabsvalue` to handle the input values more effectively.

### Updated Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(np.maximum(vmin, vmax)), tiny)
    
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

By making the suggested changes, the function should now correctly handle the input values and avoid the overflow issues encountered previously.
