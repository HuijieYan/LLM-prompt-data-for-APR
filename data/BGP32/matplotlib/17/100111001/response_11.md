## Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, triggering a calculation that leads to an overflow situation.
- The calculation that involves `maxabsvalue` and `tiny` is causing the overflow, leading to the `RuntimeWarning` messages.
- The function is trying to handle cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is extremely small by expanding the range to avoid issues. However, the calculation in this scenario causes numerical instability.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the code that handles the cases where the range difference is very small. The calculation that involves `maxabsvalue` and `tiny` should be modified to prevent overflow errors.

## The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e-3:  # Adjusted threshold to avoid overflow
        vmin = -0.5
        vmax = 0.5
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander if vmin < 0 else vmin + expander
            vmax = vmax - expander if vmax < 0 else vmax + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the threshold for the condition that triggers the range expansion and changing the calculations, we prevent the overflow issue that led to the `RuntimeWarning`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and handle edge cases more robustly.
