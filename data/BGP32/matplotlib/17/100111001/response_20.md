### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` in the code. If `vmin` is a large negative value and `vmax` is close to zero (but positive), the subtraction `vmax - vmin` may result in an overflow error due to numeric precision limitations. This leads to erroneous comparisons and incorrect handling within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the potential overflow situation properly and adjust the logic within the `nonsingular` function to avoid such errors. Specifically, we should avoid performing operations that could lead to an overflow and adjust the way the interval expansion is calculated based on the input values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny) and vmax != 0 and vmin != 0:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the numerical overflow issue by checking for `vmax != 0` and `vmin != 0` conditions before adjusting the interval expansion. Additionally, it ensures that the swapping of endpoints is correctly handled based on the `increasing` flag. After applying this fix, the function should work correctly and pass the failing tests without encountering overflow warnings.
