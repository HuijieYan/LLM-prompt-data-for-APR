### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify endpoints of a range to prevent singularities. The bug arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, causing an overflow when calculating `maxabsvalue`. This results in a `RuntimeWarning`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can adjust the condition that calculates `maxabsvalue` to prevent the overflow. Instead of directly comparing with 1e6, we can consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` compared to a threshold. By making this adjustment, we can avoid the overflow condition that triggers the warning.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the edge case where `vmax - vmin` is very small, avoiding the overflow conditions that lead to the `RuntimeWarning`.
