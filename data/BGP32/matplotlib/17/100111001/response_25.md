### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to the comparison in the line:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
```
In some cases, this comparison leads to an overflow issue resulting in the error messages about overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute calculations. The comparison fails to account for potential overflow during the subtraction operation.

### Bug Fix
To resolve the bug, we need to revise the comparison logic in the `nonsingular` function to prevent overflow during arithmetic operations. One way to address this is to use absolute values during comparison. This ensures that no overflow occurs when computing the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= abs(maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function adjusts the comparison logic to use absolute values for the differences to prevent overflow conditions and address the failing tests.
