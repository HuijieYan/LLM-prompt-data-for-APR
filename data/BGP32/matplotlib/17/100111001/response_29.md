### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculations to avoid singularities in the input range. When the `maxabsvalue` calculation involves comparing very large numbers and a tiny value, it leads to overflows and incorrect results. This bug manifests as various runtime warnings due to numerical issues in the calculations.

### Bug Location
The buggy part of the code is in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, specifically when comparing it with `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This comparison is causing overflows and issues in the subsequent calculations.

### Bug Cause
When very large or very small values are involved in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, the comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not suitable for determining if the interval is too small. This leads to incorrect calculations and runtime warnings due to overflow while performing arithmetic operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to revise the logic for determining if the interval is too small such that it triggers the needed adjustments in the function. Instead of directly comparing `maxabsvalue` to `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, we can use a different approach to handle cases where the interval is very small. Additionally, we need to ensure that the calculations do not lead to overflows.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Adjusting the conditions for handling small intervals to avoid overflows
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By revising the condition for handling small intervals and avoiding direct comparison leading to overflows, the corrected function should now handle the numerical edge cases correctly without encountering runtime warnings.
