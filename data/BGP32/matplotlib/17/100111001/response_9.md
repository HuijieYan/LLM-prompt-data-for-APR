### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, which causes overflow warning or errors in some cases. The function fails for floating-point values on or close to the edge of the representable range due to overflow errors during absolute value calculation or subtraction.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, when `vmin = 0` and `vmax = 1`, `maxabsvalue` is calculated as 1. This doesn't produce an error because the values are small integers.
2. In Case 2, with `vmin = -0.5` and `vmax = 1.5`, `maxabsvalue` is calculated as 1.5 which is now a floating-point number. This is where the error starts occurring as we're close to boundary values.
3. In Case 3, where `vmin = 0.5` and `vmax = -0.5`, a swap happens making `maxabsvalue` as 0.5 which also doesn't lead to an error.
4. In Case 4, with `vmin = -inf` and `vmax = inf`, the infinity values cause issues during calculation.

The problem lies in how `maxabsvalue` is computed and used in the subsequent conditional logic.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` and address the potential overflow issues. One way to approach this is by rethinking how the expansion calculations are done and revisiting the condition that triggers the expansion.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin < vmax:
        vmin_orig, vmax_orig = vmin, vmax
    else:
        vmin_orig, vmax_orig = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin_orig), abs(vmax_orig))
    diff = vmax - vmin

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif diff < tiny * abs(maxabsvalue):
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin_orig)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax_orig)

    if not increasing and vmin_orig > vmax_orig:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

### Changes Made
1. Introduced `vmin_orig` and `vmax_orig` to preserve the original order of `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Used `diff` to calculate the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.
3. Modified the conditions where expansion happens to avoid errors related to `maxabsvalue`.

Now, the corrected function should handle edge cases gracefully without causing overflow issues and pass the failing tests successfully.
