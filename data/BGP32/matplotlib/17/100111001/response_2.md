The issue in the `nonsingular` function arises due to potential overflow errors when dealing with large numeric values. The `maxabsvalue` calculation involves comparing the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` with a very small threshold `tiny`. This threshold comparison can lead to overflow errors when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to zero.

To address this issue, we need to modify the calculation that involves `maxabsvalue` and the threshold `tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    diff = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny or diff < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By calculating the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` separately (as `diff`) and comparing it with `tiny` along with `maxabsvalue`, we prevent the overflow issues related to the comparison. This correction ensures that the function can handle cases with large values without encountering runtime warnings or errors.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
