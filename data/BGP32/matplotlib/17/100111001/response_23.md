The issue in the buggy function `nonsingular` is related to handling extreme cases where the input values are too large. The error message pertains to overflow when performing calculations with very large numbers.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks for extreme values and computations involving very large numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the function `nonsingular`:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    tol = (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny
    
    if maxabsvalue < tol:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expander_value = expander * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
            vmin -= expander_value
            vmax += expander_value

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version introduces a `tol` variable to store the threshold value for large numbers to avoid overflow. The adjustment in the calculations involving `expander` results in more stable behavior for extreme cases.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected `nonsingular` function should now handle large numbers without generating overflow errors and pass the failing tests.
