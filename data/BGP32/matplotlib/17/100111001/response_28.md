The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to potential overflow issues when calculating `maxabsvalue`. The function aims to handle singular cases by modifying the endpoints of a range. However, when calculating `maxabsvalue`, it might encounter values leading to overflow issues.

To fix the bug, it is crucial to ensure that the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` are performed with caution, especially considering the potential for overflow. One strategy could be to refactor the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to prevent overflow and accurately determine the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function taking into account the potential overflow issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin, abs_vmax = abs(vmin), abs(vmax)
    
    if abs_vmax < abs_vmin:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmin
    else:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmax

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By properly calculating `maxabsvalue` based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, we can avoid the potential overflow issues seen in the failing tests. This corrected version should address the problem and allow the tests to pass successfully.
