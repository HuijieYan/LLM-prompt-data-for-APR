### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be caused by handling extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` that lead to overflow warnings during the calculations in the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, the function attempts to calculate `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, which may result in overflow encountered in scalar operations when dealing with very large values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and prevent overflow warnings, we need to handle extreme values properly and ensure that the calculations remain within reasonable bounds without encountering overflow. One approach is to modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` when dealing with very large values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Updated `nonsingular` Function:
Here's an updated version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the overflow issue by handling extreme values more gracefully:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmin_abs = abs(vmin)
    vmax_abs = abs(vmax)
    
    maxabsvalue = max(vmin_abs, vmax_abs)
    if vabs_abs == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * vmin_abs / maxabsvalue
        vmax += expander * vmax_abs / maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This updated version of the function should handle extreme cases more effectively, preventing overflow warnings while still appropriately expanding the range of values when necessary.
