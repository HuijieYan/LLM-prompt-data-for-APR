### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very large, leading to an overflow when performing calculations like subtraction and absolute value. This is indicated by the error messages such as "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute."

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculations performed within the `nonsingular` function do not lead to overflow errors. One way to achieve this is to handle cases where the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very large in a way that prevents overflow.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) > abs(vmin):
            vmax = expander if vmax == 0 else vmax * (1 + expander)
            vmin = -vmax if swapped and not increasing else -expander
        else:
            vmin = -expander if vmin == 0 else vmin * (1 - expander)
            vmax = -vmin if swapped and not increasing else expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Summary of Changes
- Modified the calculation when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is small to prevent overflow issues by checking if `abs(vmax)` is greater than `abs(vmin)`.
- Adjusted the calculations for `vmin` and `vmax` inside the `elif` block to avoid overflows.
- Improved handling of cases where swapping is needed in relation to increasing values.
