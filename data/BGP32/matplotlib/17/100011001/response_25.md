The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by potential overflow errors when computing the `maxabsvalue`. The error messages indicate that the function is encountering overflow while performing arithmetic operations, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` do not lead to overflow. One way to handle this is to use absolute values to prevent negative numbers from causing issues during subsequent arithmetic operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Use abs() around the difference
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By ensuring that we are working with absolute values where necessary, we prevent potential arithmetic overflow issues and correct the behavior of the function.
