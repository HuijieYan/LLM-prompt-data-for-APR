The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to how endpoints are modified to avoid singularities. The error messages indicate problems with overflow in calculations. The main issue arises when calculating `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`, leading to overflow and absolute value calculation errors.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the calculation of `maxabsvalue` in a more resilient way to avoid overflow. One approach could be to first ensure that both `vmin` and `vmax` are finite, then prioritize comparing their absolute values to determine the maximum absolute value without causing overflow or absolute value errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = abs_vmax if abs_vmax > abs_vmin else abs_vmin

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(np.float64).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and ensuring the finite check on `vmin` and `vmax`, the function should now be able to handle the problematic scenarios that led to overflow and absolute value errors, passing the failing tests provided.
