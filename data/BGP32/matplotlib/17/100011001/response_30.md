The issue in the `nonsingular` function is related to potential overflow during calculations, leading to `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` errors.

To fix this bug, we need to address the potential overflow issues in the function. Specifically, we need to handle the calculations in a way that prevents overflow while ensuring correct behavior.

One way to address this is by checking for extreme values and adjusting the calculations accordingly. For example, in the `maxabsvalue` calculation, we can ensure that the values used in the subsequent calculations are within a valid range.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This correction should handle the potential overflow scenarios and prevent the RuntimeWarnings from occurring. Feel free to test this corrected function with the failing test cases.
