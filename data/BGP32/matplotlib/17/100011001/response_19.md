### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to potential overflows encountered when performing calculations with large values or near-zero intervals. The error messages indicate that overflow is encountered when subtracting values, or when taking the absolute value of a scalar, resulting in runtime warnings.

From the runtime values and types provided:
- In Case 1, the calculated `maxabsvalue` is lower than the interval, which might trigger the section that leads to overflow when subtracting.
- In Case 2, the `maxabsvalue` calculation is correct but potentially problematic when calculating the intersection of the interval and tiny, leading to an overflow when taking the absolute value.
- In Case 3, the incorrect swap and the subsequent `maxabsvalue` calculation set the stage for potential errors.
- In Case 4, handling infinite values is missing, causing potential issues when computing with infinite values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Address the potential overflow conditions (e.g., when calculating `maxabsvalue`).
2. Ensure correct handling of infinite values.
3. Verify that the order of setting `vmin` and `vmax` is maintained based on `increasing` flag.
4. Adjust the expander calculation to expand the interval appropriately.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.max([abs(vmin), tiny])
            vmax += expander * np.max([abs(vmax), tiny])

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrections include handling the calculation of `maxabsvalue` correctly and ensuring the correct expansion of the interval while avoiding overflows and maintaining proper order based on the `increasing` flag.
