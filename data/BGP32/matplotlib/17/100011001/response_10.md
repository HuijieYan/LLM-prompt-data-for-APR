The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to handling potential overflow issues when subtracting `vmax - vmin` and calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Analysis:
1. The error message shows that there are overflow warnings when subtracting values, particularly in the lines:
    a. `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:`
    b. `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`
2. The input values and types are crucial in understanding the bug; they are within the appropriate ranges.
3. The function intends to modify the intervals based on certain conditions, but due to floating-point precision and absolute value calculations, it encounters overflow problems.

### Bug Cause:
1. Overflow in the subtraction operation is caused by excessively large values (20000, 32768) being subtracted in a space that is too small to handle those differences.
2. Overflow during absolute value calculation arises due to extremely large negative inputs.

### Fix Strategy:
1. To handle the overflow during subtraction, adjust the condition to prevent large differences from causing overflow.
2. To prevent overflow during the absolute value calculation, ensure that negative values are handled properly.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxvalue = max(vmin, vmax)
    minvalue = min(vmin, vmax)

    if maxvalue - minvalue <= maxvalue * tiny or maxvalue / minvalue < 0:
        vmin = minvalue - expander
        vmax = maxvalue + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the condition to consider both the differences and the ratio between vmax and vmin, and correctly handling the min and max values, we can prevent overflow issues and ensure the correct behavior of the `nonsingular` function.
