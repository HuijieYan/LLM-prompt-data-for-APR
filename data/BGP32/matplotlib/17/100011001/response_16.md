The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to potential overflow issues when calculating `maxabsvalue`. The error messages indicate `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`, which indicates that the calculations are resulting in overflow errors.

The calculations for `maxabsvalue` compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, which can lead to overflow problems. In Case 4, when dealing with values such as `-inf` and `inf`, absolute values can cause overflow issues.

To fix this bug, you can modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to ensure there are no overflow problems and handle extreme cases like `inf`. One way to address this is to check for `inf` values explicitly before performing calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.isposinf(vmin) or np.isposinf(vmax) or np.isneginf(vmin) or np.isneginf(vmax):
        # Handling inf values to avoid overflow issues
        new_vmin = -expander
        new_vmax = expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            new_vmin = -expander
            new_vmax = expander
        elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                new_vmin = -expander
                new_vmax = expander
            else:
                new_vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
                new_vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        new_vmin, new_vmax = new_vmax, new_vmin
    return new_vmin, new_vmax
```

This corrected version explicitly handles cases with infinite values to prevent overflow problems and ensures that the calculations are performed correctly without encountering runtime warnings.
