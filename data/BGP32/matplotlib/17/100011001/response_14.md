### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculations involving `maxabsvalue`. The error messages indicate runtime warnings related to an overflow while using scalar subtraction and taking the absolute value of extreme values. This issue arises in cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is extremely small compared to the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, leading to incorrect expansions or swaps.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function first checks if `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite and returns `-expander, expander` in those cases.
2. It then determines if `vmax` is less than `vmin`, swapping them if necessary.
3. The function calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. There are two potential problematic regions:
   - If `maxabsvalue` is very small compared to `tiny`, it directly sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`, which may not be correct.
   - Another issue arises when `vmax - vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. In this case, it expands `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values with the `expander`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions to handle edge cases more appropriately. Specifically, we need to address the cases where the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small compared to their absolute values to prevent overflows during calculations.

### Updated Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
        
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / 2
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / 2

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The changes made include adjusting the calculation for the case where `vmax - vmin` is very small compared to the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, ensuring that proper adjustments are made to avoid overflows and potential errors in the function's logic.
