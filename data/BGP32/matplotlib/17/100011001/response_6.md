## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to potential overflow errors when calculating `maxabsvalue`. The function is designed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, but if the `vmin` and `vmax` values are too large, it could result in overflow during the calculation of `maxabsvalue`.

In Case 4 where `vmin` is `-inf` and `vmax` is `inf`, the function is trying to calculate `maxabsvalue = max(abs(-inf), abs(inf))`, which leads to overflow issues resulting in RuntimeWarnings.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are large enough to cause overflow. One approach is to avoid directly comparing `vmin` and `vmax` to each other, and instead focus on dealing with their absolute values. By ensuring that the calculations won't cause overflows, we can mitigate the RuntimeWarnings.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
        
    expanded = False
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax
            expanded = True

    if vmax < vmin: 
        swapped = True
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version avoids overflow by using the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` in the calculations, preventing potential RuntimeWarning issues.
