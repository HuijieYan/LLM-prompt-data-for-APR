The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely due to the comparison done in the "elif" block. When `vmax - vmin` is close to zero, causing an overflow in the scalar subtract operation, a RuntimeWarning is raised. This issue also arises when calculating `maxabsvalue` and taking the absolute value of `vmax` or `vmin`.

To fix this bug and prevent the overflow issue, we should avoid the subtraction that could lead to overflow. Instead, we can compare `vmax` and `vmin` directly with the tolerance `tiny`. Additionally, handling absolute values carefully will prevent the RuntimeWarning due to overflow in the calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax <= vmin + maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander if vmax > 0 else vmin + expander
            vmax = vmax + expander if vmin > 0 else vmax - expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the inputs correctly and avoid the RuntimeWarnings related to overflow issues when determining the endpoints.
