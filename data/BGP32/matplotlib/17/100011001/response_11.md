The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from handling extreme float values that lead to overflow errors. The function aims to avoid singularities by modifying endpoints within a specific range. In cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` approaches tiny values, it attempts to expand the range based on the provided parameters.

The error messages suggest that overflow is encountered when performing subtraction and absolute operations on extreme values.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of extreme values and ensure that operations are performed within sensible numerical bounds to prevent overflow issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue >= tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    else:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    if increasing:
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

This version of the function handles extreme values more gracefully and avoids potential overflow by modifying the expansion process based on the magnitude of the endpoints. Make sure to test this corrected function to verify that it resolves the overflow issues.
