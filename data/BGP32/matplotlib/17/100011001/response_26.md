### Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to potential overflow encountered in scalar operations, resulting in RuntimeWarnings. Specifically, the cases pointed out in the failing tests mention overflow encountered in operations like scalar subtract and scalar absolute.

Looking at the implementation of the `nonsingular` function, it's clear that the calculations are trying to avoid singularities and perform adjustments to the endpoints based on certain conditions. However, the approach taken for handling extreme values and very small intervals is leading to overflow situations and potential numerical issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the overflows and potential numerical issues, we need to handle extreme cases and small intervals more robustly. Specifically, attention needs to be paid to the conditions impacting the adjustments of `vmin` and `vmax`. Ensuring that these adjustments are stable and avoid overflow situations is crucial for a correct implementation.

### Bug Fix
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) <= tiny and abs(vmin) <= tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the potential overflow issues and ensures that adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` are performed in a stable manner. It also considers extreme cases and small intervals to prevent numerical problems.
