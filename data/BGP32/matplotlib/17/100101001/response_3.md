The buggy function `nonsingular` has a logic error that leads to failing the provided tests. The issue arises when the input `vmin` and `vmax` are both zero or very close to zero, in which case the function should return `-expander, expander` but is not handling this case correctly.

The bug arises from the following section of the code:
```python
if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
    vmin = -expander
    vmax = expander
```

When both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero, the condition `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` might not be met due to floating-point precision issues. This results in the function not returning the correct values for this scenario.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to check if the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small instead of a direct comparison to zero. This way, we can accurately determine if both values are effectively zero or very close to zero.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, atol=1e-16):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using `np.isclose` to compare `vmin` and `vmax` with a small tolerance, we can accurately detect when both values are very close to zero and handle the scenario appropriately. This correction should make the function behave correctly and pass the failing tests.
