### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition that checks if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is small enough to trigger adjustments. The bug manifests when the interval is exactly 0 or very close to 0, and both `vmin` and `vmax` are non-zero. In such cases, the incorrect adjustment is made by expanding the interval symmetrically instead of preserving their relative sizes leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of code that handles adjusting the endpoints when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is small. Instead of symmetrically expanding both `vmin` and `vmax`, we should adjust them based on their sign to preserve their relative positions within the range.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if swapped:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / maxabsvalue
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / maxabsvalue
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / maxabsvalue * np.sign(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / maxabsvalue * np.sign(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Summary
By adjusting the interval expansion in the `nonsingular` function based on the signs of `vmin` and `vmax`, we ensure that their relative positions are preserved, fixing the bug that caused the failing test.
