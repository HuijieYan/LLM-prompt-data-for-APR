### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are both finite, but the condition for adjusting the endpoints based on their difference is triggering when it shouldn't. This leads to incorrect adjustments and failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where the endpoints are modified based on their difference. The adjustment should only happen when the difference in endpoints is less than `tiny` times the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Bug Fix Summary
The correction involves adjusting the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to correctly handle the comparison when modifying the endpoints. After this fix, the function should behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
