The bug is caused by the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` not being correctly calculated in the function `nonsingular`. This condition is supposed to check if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is small enough to require expansion. However, due to the way it's calculated, it does not cover all potential cases where expansion is necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to reconsider how we determine when to expand the interval based on the relative size of the interval compared to the endpoints. Additionally, we should handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite separately.

Below is the corrected version of the function `nonsingular`:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif interval_size < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            adjustment = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= adjustment
            vmax += adjustment

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of checking for interval expansion correctly and handles the cases of infinite `vmin` and `vmax` separately. This fix should now pass the failing test cases.
