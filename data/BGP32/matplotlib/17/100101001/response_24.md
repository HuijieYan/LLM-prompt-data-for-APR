### Bugs identified in the buggy function:
1. The condition to check if either *vmin* or *vmax* is finite is incorrect. It should return -expander, expander if either is not finite (inf or nan).
2. The logic for expanding the interval if it is too small based on *tiny* is flawed and not accurately considering the interval size.
3. The check for vmin == 0 and vmax == 0 to expand the interval is incorrect since it should be based on the interval size and not specific values.
4. The swapping of *vmin* and *vmax* is not handled correctly when the inputs are swapped and the increasing flag is False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition to check for finite values.
2. Revise the logic for expanding the interval based on the interval size.
3. Update the condition to expand the interval rather than rely on specific values.
4. Adjust the swapping logic to properly handle the scenario where inputs are swapped and the increasing flag is False.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if interval_size < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        padding = expander * maxabsvalue
        vmin -= padding
        vmax += padding

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = (vmax, vmin) if vmin < vmax else (vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By making these changes in the corrected version of the function, the failing tests should now pass correctly.
