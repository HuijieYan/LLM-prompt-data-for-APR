### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the input `vmin` and `vmax` are both very close to zero (Case 3) or both inputs are 0, resulting in the condition where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` evaluates to `True`. This condition leads to an erroneous expansion of the interval, causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition that checks for the close proximity of `vmin` and `vmax` to account for the scenario where both inputs are close to zero or both inputs are zero. Additionally, we need to handle the case where one or both inputs are `-inf` or `inf`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if abs(vmin) < tiny:
                vmin = -expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                
            if abs(vmax) < tiny:
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or both zero correctly.
