### Bug Analysis:
1. The function "nonsingular" is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, handling cases where the inputs are infinite, NaN, or close to zero.
2. The function seems to have a bug related to the condition where both inputs are very close to zero.
3. In Case 3, when both vmin and vmax are close to zero, the function swaps them due to the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This swap is incorrect and results in the function returning swapped vmin and vmax values.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition that handles the case when both inputs are close to zero, ensuring that vmin and vmax are expanded instead of being swapped.
5. Update the logic to expand vmin and vmax when both are close to zero to avoid this incorrect swapping.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) <= tiny and abs(vmin) <= tiny:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the condition in the elif block to specifically check for both inputs being close to zero, we ensure that the endpoints are correctly expanded when needed, and the incorrect swapping is avoided. This modification should address the bug and make the function handle the cases correctly.
