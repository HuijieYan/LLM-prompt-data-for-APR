The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to occur due to incorrect handling of infinite values and cases where `vmin` and `vmax` have extreme differences. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, but the current implementation fails in some cases.

To address the issues highlighted in the failing test cases and corresponding runtime variable values, we should update the algorithm to properly handle infinite values and conditions where the range is very small.

Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax == 0) or (abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that the function properly handles the cases when inputs are infinite or close to zero. Additionally, it adjusts the endpoints of the range to avoid singularities when the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
