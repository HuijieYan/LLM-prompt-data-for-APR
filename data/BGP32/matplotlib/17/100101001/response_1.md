The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The potential error stems from the condition checking and adjustment of the interval size, specifically when dealing with very small intervals.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 1 and Case 2, the condition where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is problematic. The current logic does not correctly handle cases where the interval is very small and one of the values is close to 0. This leads to incorrect adjustments of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Refactor the condition checking for small intervals to handle cases where the interval is small and one of the values is close to zero.
- Modify the adjustment logic to accurately expand the interval when needed.
- Ensure that the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` is done consistently and correctly based on the `increasing` argument.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if interval_size < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if (vmax == 0 and abs(vmin) < expander) or (vmin == 0 and abs(vmax) < expander):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expand_amount = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expand_amount
            vmax += expand_amount

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the condition handling for small intervals and ensuring correct adjustments and swapping, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
