### Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the logic used to handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are finite, but their absolute difference is very close to zero. The conditional check `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is problematic and doesn't cover all cases correctly. Additionally, the handling of vmin and vmax when they are both zero needs to be improved as the current logic is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to cover all necessary cases appropriately.
2. Update the logic to handle cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero.
3. Ensure that the swaps are correctly done based on the `increasing` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the conditional checks, handling the case of both `vmin` and `vmax` being zero, and adjusting the swap condition based on the `increasing` parameter, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
