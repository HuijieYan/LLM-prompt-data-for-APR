To fix the buggy function `nonsingular`, we need to address the issue when the input values `vmin` and `vmax` include potential singularities. The current implementation does not handle cases where the input values might lead to overflow or similar issues.

Let's address the potential issues and provide a corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Check for potential singularities and adjust the endpoints
    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, atol=tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

Explanation of changes:
1. The code has been updated to check for potential singularity when the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small using `np.isclose` function with tolerance `atol=tiny`.
2. Adjusted the range if singularity is detected by expanding the endpoints based on the provided `expander`.

By making these modifications, we address the bug in the `nonsingular` function and ensure it can handle potential singularity cases properly.
