## Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, including scenarios where the values are not finite, need to be swapped, or need to be expanded based on certain conditions. The bug could potentially arise from incorrect calculations or comparisons within the function.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition for checking if both `vmin` and `vmax` are not finite may not work as intended.
2. The calculation for expanding the range based on the size of the interval might be incorrect.
3. Swapping of endpoints based on the `increasing` parameter may not be executed correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be related to the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` where the calculation might not correctly determine when to expand the range, leading to incorrect modification of `vmin` and `vmax`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the conditions for handling finite and non-finite values are correctly implemented.
2. Verify the calculations for expanding the range based on the interval size and adjust if necessary.
3. Make sure that the swapping of endpoints respects the `increasing` parameter.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True
    else:
        if vmin < vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the conditions for expanding the range and adjusting the swapping logic based on the `increasing` parameter, the function should now pass the failing test without encountering the previous bug.
