### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a given range to avoid singularities. The function checks for singularity cases where either `vmin` or `vmax` is infinite, and also swaps `vmin` and `vmax` if `vmax` < `vmin`. Additionally, it expands the range if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than a threshold value (`tiny`).

### Identified Bugs:
1. The condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` might not be valid for some cases, leading to incorrect value adjustments.
2. In the singularity check, the condition where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero should be checked more efficiently.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is designed to check that casting to float occurs early enough to prevent overflows or errors. The bug in the `nonsingular` function may cause incorrect adjustments to the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, leading to failed assertions against the expected values in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the singularity check condition to handle cases more accurately.
2. Enhance the check for values close to zero to prevent singularity issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny or (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax < tiny and vmin < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By incorporating the suggested changes in the corrected function, it addresses the identified issues and should now pass the failing test successfully.
