### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the endpoints based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the behavior of `im.norm.vmin` and `im.norm.vmax` against the input values `clim`.

### Error Location:
The bug could potentially be in the calculation logic within the `nonsingular` function, where the adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` might not be correctly handled for certain input ranges causing the failing test to occur.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely causing incorrect adjustments to the range endpoints when certain conditions are met. This results in the calculated `vmin` and `vmax` differing from the expected `clim` values in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for calculating `vmin` and `vmax` based on both the absolute values and the input range.
2. Ensure that the conditions for adjusting the endpoints are correctly handled to match the expected behavior specified in the function docstring and the failing test.
3. Check and correct the handling of cases where `vmax < vmin`, as this seems to be a critical point of failure.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:  # Adjusting for vmax < vmin case
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing: # Adjust swap condition considering increasing flag
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` based on the conditions described above, the corrected `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test successfully.
