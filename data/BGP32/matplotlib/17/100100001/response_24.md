The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition does not correctly handle cases where `vmax` is significantly smaller than `vmin`, leading to incorrect adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `nonsingular` function to properly handle situations where `vmax` is smaller than `vmin`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            mean_val = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            vmin = mean_val - expander
            vmax = mean_val + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
