### Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is responsible for modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The issue seems to be with the way the function is handling cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero. The conditions and calculations within the function might not be correctly handling this scenario.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the section where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. Specifically, the condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` along with the subsequent calculations might not be correctly adjusting the endpoints in these cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely triggered when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. The condition in question (`if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`) might not be properly handling this situation, leading to incorrect adjustments in the endpoints.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are extremely small or close to zero. Adjustments in these scenarios should align with the intended behavior of the function to avoid singularities.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmin) <= tiny and abs(vmax) <= tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * max(tiny, abs(vmin))
            vmax += expander * max(tiny, abs(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment for cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero has been updated. The `elif` block now correctly handles scenarios where both values are very small, ensuring that the endpoints are adjusted appropriately to avoid singularities. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
