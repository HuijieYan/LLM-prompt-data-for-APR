## Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions and parameters. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function that may cause it to fail the provided test.

1. The comparison of `maxabsvalue` with `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` might not accurately handle cases where the interval is very small relative to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints.
2. The calculation of `vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)` and `vmax += expander*abs(vmax)` might not always ensure that the interval is correctly expanded without causing issues.
3. The condition `if swapped and not increasing` for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` might not be correctly handling cases where the input values are not strictly increasing.

## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails the test due to inaccuracies in handling small intervals and swapped values. In cases where the interval is very small relative to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints, the function may not correctly expand the range. Additionally, the condition for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` might not work as intended in all scenarios.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the condition for expanding the interval to accurately handle small intervals.
2. Revise the calculation of expanded endpoints to ensure the correct expansion without issues.
3. Adjust the swapping logic to handle cases where the input values are not strictly increasing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmin == vmax == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            midpoint = (vmin + vmax) / 2
            vmin = midpoint - expander / 2
            vmax = midpoint + expander / 2
    
    if increasing:
        return vmin, vmax
    else:
        return vmax, vmin
```

By incorporating the suggested improvements in handling small intervals, endpoint expansion, and swapping logic, the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
