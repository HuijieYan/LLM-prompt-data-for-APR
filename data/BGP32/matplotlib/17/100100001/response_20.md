The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` can result in incorrect behavior, especially when dealing with small intervals that should be expanded.

To fix the bug, we should check if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than `tiny` directly, rather than comparing it to a calculated `maxabsvalue`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By directly comparing the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` to `tiny`, we ensure that small intervals are correctly expanded. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
