The issue with the `nonsingular` function is in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, which is comparing the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` with a threshold that is not appropriate for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=tiny): # Check if the interval is too small based on the threshold provided
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

Explanation of Changes Made:
1. Removed the calculation of `maxabsvalue` as it was not needed and could cause issues.
2. Replaced the comparison of `vmax - vmin` with `np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=tiny)` to check if the interval is too small based on the provided threshold `tiny`.
3. Removed the unnecessary check for both `vmax` and `vmin` being zero, and directly expanded the interval if it was too small.

With these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test.
