The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the logic used to handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are too close to each other or are equal to zero. This can result in incorrect adjustments being made to the endpoints.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the adjustments made to `vmin` and `vmax` are correct when the interval is too small or both inputs are close to zero. In such cases, the function should return adjusted endpoints that are properly expanded.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
        if abs(vmax) < tiny:
            vmax = expander
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are too close to each other or are close to zero, ensuring that the adjustments made are correct. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
