The bug in the provided function `nonsingular` lies in the calculation of the condition for expanding the interval when it's too small. The bug causes the function to return incorrect values when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is smaller than a certain threshold (`maxabsvalue * tiny`).

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition for expanding the interval and adjust the calculations accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue < 1e-12:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            mid = (vmin + vmax) / 2
            vmin = mid - expander/2
            vmax = mid + expander/2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the case where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` needs to be expanded. It also correctly swaps `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter and returns the endpoints with the necessary modifications.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
