The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the incorrect comparison of `maxabsvalue` with `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This comparison should be based on the magnitude of `vmax - vmin` instead.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin < tiny:
        # Check if the difference between vmax and vmin is less than tiny
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            mean = 0.5 * (vmin + vmax)
            vmin = mean - expander
            vmax = mean + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

Fixing the comparison condition for the `vmax - vmin` difference and appropriately calculating the mean value between the endpoints when expanding the range will ensure that the function behaves correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
