The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the calculation for expanding the endpoints when the interval is too small. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` may not accurately determine when to expand the interval, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for expanding the endpoints based on the interval size. One approach is to check if the interval size is smaller than the threshold `tiny` and expand if needed. Additionally, we should consider swapping `vmin` and `vmax` when `increasing=False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2
        vmin = midpoint - expander
        vmax = midpoint + expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised version simplifies the logic for expanding the interval and correctly handles cases where the interval is too small. It also checks for the `increasing` flag to determine whether to swap the endpoints. This version should pass the failing test for the `nonsingular` function.
