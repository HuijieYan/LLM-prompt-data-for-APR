The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the incorrect calculation and comparison of the interval length. When the interval is small, the function should expand the range by adding a small amount to both `vmin` and `vmax`. However, the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is problematic and doesn't handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments of the range.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition checking for a small interval and adjust the endpoints accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) < 2 * tiny:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            adjustment = (expander / 2) if increasing else -(expander / 2)
            avg = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            vmin = avg - adjustment
            vmax = avg + adjustment

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
