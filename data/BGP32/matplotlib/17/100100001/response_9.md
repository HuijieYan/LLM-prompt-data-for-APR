The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the calculation and adjustment of the `vmin` and `vmax` values based on the conditions provided. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to expand the interval when it is too small, or when both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero.

To fix this bug:
1. Calculate the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` as `interval_diff`.
2. Check if `interval_diff` is smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny` to determine if the interval is too small.
3. Adjust `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly by expanding them symmetrically if the interval is too small or both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero.
4. Ensure that the correct magnitude of `expander` is used for adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_diff = vmax - vmin

    if interval_diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            sym_expander = expander * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
            vmin -= sym_expander
            vmax += sym_expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the `nonsingular` function should pass the failing test provided.
