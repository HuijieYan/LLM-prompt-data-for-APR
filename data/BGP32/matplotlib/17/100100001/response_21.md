The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the condition for expanding the interval when `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The issue arises when comparing `maxabsvalue` to `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This comparison does not correctly handle situations where `maxabsvalue` is within the expected threshold range but the actual interval `vmax - vmin` is smaller than expected due to floating-point errors.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition for expanding the interval to consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` independently, rather than comparing it to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. We can also simplify the code by removing unnecessary cases where `vmax == 0` and `vmin == 0`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test provided.
