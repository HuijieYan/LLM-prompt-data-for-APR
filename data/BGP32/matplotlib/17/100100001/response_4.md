The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition for checking the interval size and expanding it if necessary. The bug causes the function to return incorrect endpoint values when the inputs are very close to zero.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to adjust the condition for checking the interval size to correctly handle cases where the interval is close to zero. Additionally, we need to ensure that the endpoints are swapped if the input flag `increasing` is set to False.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

After applying this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test provided.
