The bug in the `nonsingular` function can be identified in the section where it checks if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small and needs to be expanded. The bug causes incorrect expansion of the endpoints, leading to a failure in the test as it expects the correct endpoints.

The main issue is in this part of the code:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
```

Instead of adjusting the endpoints based on expander and absolute value, a better approach would be to add a fraction of the maximum absolute value to both `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        # Adjust the endpoints by adding a fraction of the max absolute value
        expand_amount = expander * maxabsvalue
        vmin -= expand_amount
        vmax += expand_amount

        # Check if new vmin and vmax are swapped
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the `nonsingular` function should now correctly adjust the endpoints to avoid singularities and pass the failing test.
