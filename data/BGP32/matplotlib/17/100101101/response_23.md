### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the inputs `vmin` and `vmax` are on different scales, leading to errors in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. This results in incorrect adjustments being made to the endpoints, causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `maxabsvalue` calculation considers the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` correctly, regardless of their scale. This can be achieved by modifying the calculation approach and adjusting the conditional statements accordingly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).tiny / tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the maxabsvalue calculation and adjusting the adjustment calculations to be relative to the maximum absolute value, we have fixed the bug in the `nonsingular` function. Now, the function should correctly adjust the endpoints to avoid singularities and pass the failing tests.
