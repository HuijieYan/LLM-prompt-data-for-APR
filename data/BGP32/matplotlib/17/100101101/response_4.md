### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `nonsingular` function receives input parameters where the `vmin` and `vmax` values are both very close to zero. In this scenario, the function is supposed to return `-expander` and `expander` respectively, but due to the way the conditionals are structured, it fails to do so.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements inside the function, specifically in the part where it checks if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. We need to make sure that if both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero, the function returns `-expander` and `expander` as specified.

### Corrected Version
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By implementing the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, the function will now behave as expected in scenarios where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero, ensuring that it returns `-expander` and `expander` in such cases.
