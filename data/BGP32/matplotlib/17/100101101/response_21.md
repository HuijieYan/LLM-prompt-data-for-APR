### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the improper handling of very large input values that lead to incorrect expansions of the range. This results in failing the test cases where the function is expected to properly handle the input data and return the expanded range correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements inside the `nonsingular` function to properly handle very large or small input values. Specifically, we need to ensure that the range expansion is calculated correctly based on the input values while considering the defined `expander` and `tiny` thresholds.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these adjustments to the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and return the expanded range as expected.
