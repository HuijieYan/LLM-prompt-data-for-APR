### Bug in the Buggy Function:

The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to how it handles swapping the endpoints (`vmin` and `vmax`) when `increasing` is set to `True`. The function incorrectly swaps the endpoints when they are initially given in decreasing order (`vmax < vmin`), but `increasing` is still set as `True`.

### Correction Strategy:

To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to adjust the logic responsible for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter. It should only swap the values when `increasing` is set to `False` and the endpoints are not in the correct order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By incorporating this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now properly handle the swapping of endpoints based on the `increasing` parameter, ensuring correct behavior in scenarios where endpoints need to be swapped.
