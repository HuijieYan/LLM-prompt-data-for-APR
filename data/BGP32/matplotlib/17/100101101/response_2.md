### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the conditional statement that checks if the interval between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small relative to the absolute values of `vmax` and `vmin`. The bug causes the function to incorrectly adjust the endpoints when they are near zero or very small, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Cause of the Bug
1. Case 1: The function doesn't handle integer input values correctly, leading to incorrect float conversion and comparison.
2. Case 2: The function fails to properly adjust the endpoints when `maxabsvalue` is below the threshold due to incorrect comparison logic.
3. Case 3: Swapping logic is not handled correctly when `vmax` is less than `vmin`, resulting in incorrect adjustments.
4. Case 4: Handling of infinite values is incorrect, leading to an incorrect adjustment of endpoints.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic for adjusting the endpoints based on the input values and handling special cases like integers, infinites, and swapping logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now handle the different cases correctly and pass all the failing tests.
