### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the conditional statement that checks if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than a threshold. In Case 3, when `vmin` is greater than `vmax`, and a swap occurs, the bug causes the function to incorrectly detect singularity based on the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This logic is flawed and leads to incorrect adjustments of `vmin` and `vmax` when they should not be modified.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the singularity check condition to handle cases where a swap has taken place correctly. We should also ensure that singularity adjustments are only made when necessary and not in cases where the input values are within the valid range.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    max_abs_value = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if max_abs_value < tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    
    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval <= max_abs_value * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Changes Made
1. Updated the singularity check condition to handle cases when `vmin` is greater than `vmax` after the swap.
2. Improved the condition to check for cases where inputs are inf, nan, or both zero.
3. Separate the swap check and the singularity adjustment logic to handle each case appropriately.
