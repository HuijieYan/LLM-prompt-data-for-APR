### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are too small and fall below a certain threshold, leading to incorrect expansion or swapping of values. This bug is clearly visible in Case 2 which demonstrates the issue when processing non-extreme values that should not trigger the automatic expansions.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the check for `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, leading to erroneous adjustments to the input endpoints when they are not sufficiently large. This check is supposed to evaluate if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too small relative to the maximum absolute endpoint value, but it triggers incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison condition for the threshold calculation should be adjusted to ensure it accurately identifies cases where the input interval is too small for the given threshold `tiny`. By modifying this condition, the function should behave correctly for both extreme and non-extreme input values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 * tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander / 2
        vmax = vmax + expander / 2
    elif interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander / 2
        vmax = vmax + expander / 2

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By implementing this corrected version of the function, the issue causing the failing tests should be resolved. The adjustments made in the threshold calculation condition and the swapping logic ensure that the function behaves as expected for various input scenarios.
