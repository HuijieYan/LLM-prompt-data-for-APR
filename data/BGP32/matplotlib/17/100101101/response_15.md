### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises when handling extreme cases where the endpoints are very close or equal but have different signs, leading to incorrect adjustments. Specifically, the issue lies in the conditional block that checks whether to expand the interval or not based on the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`. If `vmax - vmin` is very small or zero, the function tries to adjust the endpoints considering their absolute values. This logic fails when one of the endpoints is negative, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to simplify the logic for adjusting the endpoints when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small or zero. Instead of trying to adjust based on absolute values in different cases, we should consider them directly by utilizing the difference. This adjustment should take into account the signs of the endpoints to prevent incorrect expansions.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True
        else:
            vmin = max(vmin, -expander)
            vmax = min(vmax, expander)
    else:
        interval = vmax - vmin
        if interval < tiny:
            midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            half_range = expander / 2
            vmin = midpoint - half_range
            vmax = midpoint + half_range

    return vmin, vmax
```

After making these adjustments, the corrected function should correctly handle cases where `vmax - vmin` is very small or zero, preventing incorrect expansions and adjustments. This updated logic ensures that the adjustments are done considering the signs of the endpoints and the direction of the expansion, resolving the bug in the original function.
