### Bug Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, expanding or swapping them as needed. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles very small intervals and situations when both inputs are 0.

Based on the provided runtime values and expected values, the bug stems from the scenario when `vmin` and `vmax` are close to 0. The function should expand the range to avoid singularities, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic that deals with very small intervals and inputs close to zero. We should ensure that if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to 0, we expand the range to avoid possible singularities. This adjustment should address the failing test cases provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= 2 * expander:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function now properly expands the range when both inputs are close to zero and adjusts the interval to avoid potential singularities in such cases. This modification should resolve the failing test cases and ensure the correct behavior for the `nonsingular` function.
