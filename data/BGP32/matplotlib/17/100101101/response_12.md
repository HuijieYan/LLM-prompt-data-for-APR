### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are borderline cases where the interval between them is very small, and the condition checks within the function do not handle these cases correctly. Specifically, when the interval is close to zero, the function should expand it by the `expander` value, but the current implementation does not handle this edge case properly. This leads to incorrect results and fails the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `nonsingular` function to correctly handle cases where the interval is very small and needs to be expanded.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    min_abs_diff = maxabsvalue * tiny

    if vmax - vmin <= min_abs_diff:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = max(expander, min_abs_diff)
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the logic around handling very small intervals in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
