### Bug in the buggy function
The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the incorrect comparison in the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition is not correctly handling scenarios where `vmax` and `vmin` are close to each other but have opposite signs.

### Strategy to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we need to reconsider the condition that checks if `vmax` and `vmin` are too close to each other. We should handle cases where one of them is negative and ensure that the interval is expanded appropriately.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = abs(vmax - vmin)

    if interval < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:  # Handle when both vmin and vmax are 0
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            center = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            vmin = center - expander
            vmax = center + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the condition and the calculation for expanding the interval when it is too small, the corrected function should now handle the edge cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
