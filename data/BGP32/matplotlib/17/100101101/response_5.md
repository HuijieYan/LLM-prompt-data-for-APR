### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs because the logic for handling situations where the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are below the threshold (`tiny`) is incorrect. When the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than `maxabsvalue * tiny`, the function is intended to expand the interval by adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly. However, the current implementation does not properly handle this scenario, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and calculations inside the `nonsingular` function to correctly expand the interval when `vmax - vmin` is smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny`. Specifically, we should ensure that the adjustments made to `vmin` and `vmax` are correct based on the provided threshold values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        diff = maxabsvalue * tiny - (vmax - vmin)
        vmin -= diff / 2
        vmax += diff / 2

        if vmin == vmax:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the conditions and calculations inside the `nonsingular` function as shown above, the function should now correctly handle the adjustment of endpoints when the interval is too small, ensuring that it passes the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values.
