### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `nonsingular` is supposed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on the provided parameters. The bug occurs when the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. In this case, the function should expand the range of values to avoid issues. However, due to incorrect calculations, the expansion is not happening as expected.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The calculation in this condition does not accurately capture the necessary expansion of the range when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to the threshold.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for expanding the range is correctly evaluated. This can be achieved by revisiting the expansion logic to appropriately adjust both `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `expander`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = maxabsvalue * tiny - (vmax - vmin)
            vmin -= expansion / 2
            vmax += expansion / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version properly expands the range when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to the threshold value, ensuring that singularities are avoided. The function now correctly handles the calculations required for expanding the range.
