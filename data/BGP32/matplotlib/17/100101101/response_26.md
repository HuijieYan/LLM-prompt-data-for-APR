### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the condition for checking if the interval (`vmax - vmin`) is smaller than a computed threshold value (`maxabsvalue * tiny`). This condition is flawed, as it fails to handle cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are small or around zero. When `vmin` and `vmax` are both close to zero, their difference might be smaller than the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition that determines when to adjust the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`. We should ensure that if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero, they are expanded by the `expander` value. Additionally, we should improve the handling of cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are zero by specifically checking for those scenarios.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the condition for adjusting the endpoints, we ensure that the function handles cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero appropriately. This correction should address the failing test cases outlined.
