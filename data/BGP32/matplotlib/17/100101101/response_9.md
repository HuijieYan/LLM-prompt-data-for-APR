The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of extreme values and comparisons. Here's an analysis:

1. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It checks for finite values, swaps `vmin` and `vmax` if necessary, and expands the range based on certain conditions.

2. The bug appears to be in the condition where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition might not correctly handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to 0. 

3. In Case 3, where `vmin = 0.5` and `vmax = -0.5`, the function should swap the values due to `increasing=True`. However, it fails to correctly handle this situation and returns the values without swapping, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the condition where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. We should specifically handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to 0 to ensure proper expansion of the range.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
        
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmin, 0) and np.isclose(vmax, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version now includes the additional check for when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to 0, ensuring that they are properly expanded. With this fix, the `nonsingular` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
