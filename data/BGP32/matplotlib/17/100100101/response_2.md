### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding the range if it's too small or swapping the endpoints if necessary. However, there are errors in the logic that lead to incorrect results for certain cases.

1. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not accurate and may not expand the interval correctly.
2. The calculation within the condition `vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)` and `vmax += expander*abs(vmax)` is incorrectly modifying the endpoints in certain cases.

### Bug
The bug in the function occurs when the function tries to modify the endpoints of the range based on the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. When `vmax` and `vmin` are close to each other but with different signs (e.g., `vmin = 0.5`, `vmax = -0.5`), the function calculates `vmax - vmin` as a negative value, triggering the condition inside the `elif` block. This leads to incorrect expansion of the range, causing unexpected results in such cases.

### Fix
1. Adjust the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.
2. Update the logic within the `elif` block to correctly expand the range based on the current values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Update condition to use absolute difference
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are close to each other with different signs more effectively, providing the correct range expansion when needed.
