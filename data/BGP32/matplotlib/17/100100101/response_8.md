### Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function checks for finite values, potential swapping based on an increasing flag, and expansion of intervals if they are too small compared to the maximum absolute value of their endpoints.

There are several potential error locations in the function:
1. The swapping mechanism based on the `increasing` flag could lead to incorrect results.
2. The comparisons involving `tiny` and `maxabsvalue` may not handle edge cases properly.
3. The interval expansion logic might not work as intended.

### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the **nonsingular** function is primarily related to how it handles the scenario when both `vmin` and `vmax` are equal to zero. In this case, the function incorrectly sets both `vmin` and `vmax` to `-expander` and `expander`, respectively, which leads to incorrect results. This can be observed in the failing test case where `maxabsvalue * tiny` evaluates to zero due to both `vmin` and `vmax` being zero, triggering the incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. We should handle this situation separately to ensure that the correct behavior is maintained.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue == 0:
            if vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making sure to handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero separately and considering all possible edge cases, the corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
