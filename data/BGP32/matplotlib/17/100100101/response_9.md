### Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from working correctly. 
1. The function does not handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero.
2. The comparison for `maxabsvalue` and interval size is erroneous.
3. The logic for handling `expander` is not properly implemented.

### Bug:
In all the buggy code lines where `int16` is used, since numpy `int16` does not handle negative integers as expected, this leads to incorrect calculations in the `test_colorbar_int` test function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic to handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero.
2. Correct the comparison for calculating `maxabsvalue` and checking the interval size.
3. Update the logic for `expander` to expand the interval correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny or interval < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By incorporating the corrections into the `nonsingular` function as shown above, it should now handle the cases provided in the failing test correctly.
