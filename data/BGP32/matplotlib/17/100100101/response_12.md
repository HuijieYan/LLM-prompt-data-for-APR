### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises because of the incorrect condition check on whether the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not correctly handle cases where `vmax` and `vmin` have opposite signs but are close to each other, resulting in potential incorrect expansions of the interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to identify a better condition to accurately determine when to expand the interval between `vmin` and `vmax`. One approach could be to check if the relative difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is smaller than a threshold. This can prevent unnecessary expansions when the absolute difference is misleading due to opposite signs.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    if vmax - vmin <= (expander * tiny) * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the condition to `vmax - vmin <= (expander * tiny) * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)`, the corrected function can handle cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are close to each other but have different signs, correctly expanding the interval when needed.
