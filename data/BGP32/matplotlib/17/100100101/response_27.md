### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles cases where the inputs `vmin` and `vmax` are very close or the same.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the `nonsingular` function fails to correctly handle cases where `vmin` is close to or equal to 0 due to inadequate handling of small intervals or when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0. As a result, the function does not expand the interval appropriately, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, when dealing with cases where the interval is very small or close to zero, we need to check specifically for scenarios where both endpoints are zero or very close to zero. In these cases, we should set `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander` to ensure the interval is expanded sufficiently.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Check for small interval when both endpoints are close to 0
            if abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By incorporating the additional check for small intervals when both endpoints are close to 0, the corrected function should now handle the failing test cases and satisfy all expected input/output values.
