## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when handling cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. In these cases, the function should return the endpoints as `-expander` and `expander`, respectively. However, due to incorrect conditional statements, the calculation modifies both `vmin` and `vmax` using their absolute values, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for modifying `vmin` and `vmax` when they are close to zero. Specifically, we should only consider the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` for updating them, rather than modifying them directly based on their signs.

## Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function now handles cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero appropriately, ensuring that the expected output is returned in all cases provided.
