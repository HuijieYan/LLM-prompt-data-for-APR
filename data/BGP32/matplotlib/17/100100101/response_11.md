### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding the range if necessary. However, the current implementation has several issues that lead to incorrect results. 

1. The function returns a incorrect value (-expander, expander) when either vmin or vmax is infinite. It should instead return (-expander, expander) only when both vmin and vmax are infinite.
2. There is a logical error in the section where the function deals with small intervals. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` includes a potential issue if both vmax and vmin are negative, leading to the incorrect expansion.
3. There is a case where the function does not handle vmin and vmax properly when they are very small.
4. The implementation of swapped and increasing conditions to swap vmin and vmax is incorrectly handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the condition where the function incorrectly returns (-expander, expander) if either vmin or vmax is infinite.
2. Make appropriate adjustments to deal with small intervals, ensuring correct expansion of the range.
3. Handle the case where vmin and vmax are very small appropriately to avoid incorrect adjustments.
4. Correct the swapped and increasing conditions to swap vmin and vmax.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) and not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, vmin, atol=tiny):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With these corrections, the `nonsingular` function should now handle the given test cases correctly and return expected results for different scenarios.
