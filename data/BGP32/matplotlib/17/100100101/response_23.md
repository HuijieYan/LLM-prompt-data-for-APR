### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, the function implementation has a bug where it fails to handle cases where the interval is small based on the `tiny` threshold.

### Bug Explanation
When `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, the function should expand the interval by modifying `vmin` and `vmax`. However, the implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. This bug is observed in Case 6 and Case 7, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the block where `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The correct approach should be chosen to expand the interval appropriately based on the `expander` value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        # Check if both values are 0 or close to 0
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            range_val = max(abs(vmax - vmin), tiny)
            center = (vmax + vmin) / 2.0
            vmin = center - 0.5 * range_val
            vmax = center + 0.5 * range_val

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected function adjusts the interval expansion logic in the problematic block to modify `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly. This fix should address the failing cases and provide the expected output for all input scenarios.
