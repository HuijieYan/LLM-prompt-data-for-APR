### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug appears to be related to the logic used to determine whether to expand the range if it is too small.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises when the range is considered too small, and the function tries to expand it. If both the max and min values are closer to zero than a threshold set by `tiny`, the function incorrectly expands the range to `expander` instead of adjusting based on the actual values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the condition where `maxabsvalue` is compared to the condition `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. The calculation `(1e6 / tiny)` may lead to values that are much larger than intended, causing incorrect behavior in deciding whether to expand the range.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where the range should be expanded based on the actual values of `vmin` and `vmax` rather than a generic threshold value. We should consider the actual interval length and adjust it accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if interval < tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version calculates the actual interval between `vmin` and `vmax` and compares it to `tiny` for deciding whether to expand the range. This approach ensures that the range is adjusted based on the actual values and not just a generic threshold.
