### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The main issue lies in the condition checks within the function. The function may not correctly handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are at extreme or very small values.

### Bug
The bug arises in scenarios where `vmin` and `vmax` values are at the extremes, close to zero, or where one value is negative and the other is positive. In these cases, the function doesn't handle the adjustments correctly, leading to incorrect results. 

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements in the function to properly handle extreme cases and values close to zero. Additionally, we need to consider the scenarios where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` based on the `increasing` flag.

### Corrected Version
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function now properly handles edge cases and adjusts the endpoints of the range accordingly. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
