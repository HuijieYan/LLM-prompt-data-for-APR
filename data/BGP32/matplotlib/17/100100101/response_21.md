### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug seems to be related to the comparison between computed values and expected values, which is causing the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test is related to cases where the input values are integers, particularly around the edge cases of `-32768` and `32768`. The function converts these input values to floats but due to rounding issues, the comparison with the expected values fails.

### Bug Location
The issue arises when converting integer inputs to float inside the buggy function. The comparison between the converted float values and the integer expected values is causing the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the issue, it's necessary to handle the type conversion in a way that the float values represent the integer values accurately. This can involve adjusting the way the endpoints are modified and compared within the function.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    # Adjusting the output to be integers if the input was integer
    if isinstance(vmin, int):
        vmin = int(vmin)
    if isinstance(vmax, int):
        vmax = int(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now accurately handle the input values, particularly when they are integers, and pass all the provided test cases.
