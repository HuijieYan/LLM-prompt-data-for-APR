### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, it has several issues that lead to incorrect results. 

1. In the case where `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite, it incorrectly returns `-expander, expander` regardless of other conditions.
2. The logic for expanding the range is flawed, as it does not consider cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are large numbers or very close to each other. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle the case where `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite by returning `-expander, expander` only if both are not finite.
2. Refactor the logic to expand the range by properly considering the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are large or very close to each other.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints. If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise, the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary. If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        if not np.isfinite(vmin):
            vmin = -expander
        if not np.isfinite(vmax):
            vmax = expander
        return vmin, vmax

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny or (vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test cases provided for different input values.
