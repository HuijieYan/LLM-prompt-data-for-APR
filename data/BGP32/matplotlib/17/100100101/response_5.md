### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero. In this case, the function incorrectly overrides the input values with `-expander` and `expander`, respectively, which does not align with the expected behavior defined in the function's docstring. This bug causes the function to return incorrect values when the inputs are 0 or close to zero, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to modify the code block that handles the case when `vmin` and `vmax` are too close to zero. Instead of overriding them with `-expander` and `expander`, we should adjust them according to the fractional amount specified by the `expander` parameter, as mentioned in the function's docstring.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander * maxabsvalue
        vmax = expander * maxabsvalue

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, it should now correctly handle the case when `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or close to zero without overriding them with fixed values. This fix ensures that the function aligns with the expected behavior and should pass the failing tests provided.
