### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, which tries to expand the range if the interval is too small. The bug occurs when both `vmax` and `vmin` are very close to zero, resulting in both being set to `-expander` and `expander`, which is incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for very small intervals does not inadvertently set both `vmin` and `vmax` to `-expander` and `expander`. We should consider setting only one of them to avoid this issue.

### Corrected Code
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    # New condition to handle very small interval scenario
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif vmax == 0:
            vmax = abs(vmin) if increasing else -abs(vmin)
        elif vmin == 0:
            vmin = abs(vmax) if increasing else -abs(vmax)
        else:
            # Adjust only one of vmin or vmax to prevent both from becoming -expander and expander
            vmin += expander * abs(vmin) if increasing else -expander * abs(vmin)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By implementing this correction in the `nonsingular` function, it should now handle the case of very small intervals appropriately and return the correct values based on the input parameters.
