### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by the calculation related to the interval size. When the interval size is very small or close to zero, the function should expand it. However, the comparison with `maxabsvalue * tiny` might trigger the wrong conditional branch because of a mistake in the calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition that checks if the interval should be expanded. By recalculating the condition based on the expected logic, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly for all input cases.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            vmin = midpoint - expander
            vmax = midpoint + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the interval expansion for all input cases and pass the failing test scenarios.
