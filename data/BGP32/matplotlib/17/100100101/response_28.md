### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs due to incorrect comparison logic when checking if the interval is small enough to be expanded. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is supposed to determine if the interval is smaller than a threshold (`tiny`) and expand it if needed. However, because of the condition `vmax - vmin`, negative intervals can pass this check, leading to incorrect behavior.

In the failing test case `(clim = (-32768, 0))`, when the function tries to handle negative values, the bug triggers as the condition allows for negative intervals to be treated as small and expanded incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should change the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to a more appropriate condition that correctly handles negative intervals. One solution could be to use the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` in the comparison to ensure that all cases, including positive and negative intervals, are properly evaluated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected version of the function uses `abs(vmax - vmin)` in the condition check to accurately determine if the interval is small enough to be expanded, fixing the bug that caused incorrect behavior when handling negative intervals.
