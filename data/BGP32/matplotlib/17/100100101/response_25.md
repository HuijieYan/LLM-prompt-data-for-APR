### Analysis
The function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. The potential error locations could be in the block that tries to handle cases when the inputs are infinite or when the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small relative to the maximum absolute value.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails the provided test because it does not correctly handle the case when the values are close to the limits. Specifically, in the failing test case of `test_colorbar_int`, the function does not expand the range properly for (-32768, 0) and therefore fails the equality check `assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function expands the range correctly when it is close to the resolution limits. This can be achieved by updating the conditions in the `nonsingular` function to properly handle such cases.

### The Corrected Function

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Ensure that vmin <= vmax by swapping if necessary
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    max_range = max(abs(vmax - vmin), tiny)
    if (max_range < tiny) or (np.isclose(abs(vmax), 0) and np.isclose(abs(vmin), 0)):
        # If the range is too small or both inputs are close to zero
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:  # Swap back if necessary
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

After fixing the buggy function as shown above, it should pass the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output cases provided.
