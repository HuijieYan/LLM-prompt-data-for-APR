### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. However, there are bugs in the function that lead to incorrect behavior and cause failures in the provided test cases.

### Issues
1. The function is designed to handle floating-point values, but the test cases include integer values. 
2. The function does not handle cases where `tiny` is a very small value properly.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case `test_colorbar_int`, the function `nonsingular` is called to handle integer values, which results in incorrect comparisons with float values. Additionally, the condition `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` does not handle cases where `tiny` is very small, leading to incorrect expansion behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Cast the integer inputs to float before passing them to the `nonsingular` function.
2. Modify the condition involving `tiny` to avoid issues with very small values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints. If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(float(vmin))) or (not np.isfinite(float(vmax))):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if float(vmax) < float(vmin):
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / max(tiny, 1e-15)) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if float(vmax) == 0 and float(vmin) == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(float(vmin))
            vmax += expander * abs(float(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function handles the integer inputs correctly and adjusts the condition involving `tiny` to prevent issues with very small values. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
