### Analysis
The buggy `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function has conditions to handle various scenarios like infinities, swapping values, expanding intervals, and handling small intervals. However, the implementation has a bug that causes it to return incorrect values in certain cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are both integers. In such cases, the calculations in the function are performed with integer arithmetic, leading to unexpected results and possibly incorrect endpoint values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations are performed using floating-point arithmetic instead of integer arithmetic when dealing with the input values `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)  # Convert integers to floats

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By converting the input values to floats before any calculations are performed, the corrected function will handle integer endpoints correctly. This fix will ensure that the function returns the expected values for all the provided test cases.
