### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is supposed to modify and adjust the endpoints of a given range (`vmin`, `vmax`) to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. However, there are some issues in the function that need to be fixed. 

#### Issues:
1. The function is not handling cases where the inputs (`vmin`, `vmax`) are integers properly.
2. The function does not account for the case when both inputs are very close to zero or both are zero.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to handle cases where the input values are integers as seen in the failing test. When the input values are integers, the function does not properly adjust the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` according to the conditions specified. This leads to incorrect outputs and failing tests due to improper calculations and logic.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles integer values by converting them to floating point numbers before performing calculations and adjustments. Additionally, we need to address the condition where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or equal to zero, ensuring that the function correctly expands the range in such cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmax = float(vmax)
    vmin = float(vmin)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Final Note
The corrected version of the function now properly handles integer inputs by converting them to floating point numbers. It also addresses the issue with the condition when both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or equal to zero, ensuring the correct expansion of the range in such cases.
