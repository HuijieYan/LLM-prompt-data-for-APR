### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny`. The condition that follows does not handle cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are both 0 properly. If both are exactly 0, the adjustment does not happen correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `vmax` and `vmin` are both 0 differently. Instead of directly adjusting them with the expander, we should set them explicitly to `-expander` and `expander`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if (vmax, vmin) == (0, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
