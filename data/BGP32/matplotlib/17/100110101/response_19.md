### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to prevent singularities. However, the function encounters issues with numerical overflow and scalar operations, leading to the observed errors.

#### Issues:
1. The function does not handle large input values well, resulting in numerical overflow warnings.
2. There are problems with scalar operations, such as subtracting two numbers directly without considering the type.
3. Type conversions of input may introduce inaccuracies in calculations.

### Bug Causes
In the failing tests, cases with large numeric values cause the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` errors. These occur due to inappropriate handling of large values and scalar operations.

### Fix Strategy
1. Handle large input values by avoiding direct comparisons that might trigger overflows.
2. Use appropriate types for variables to prevent precision loss during calculations.
3. Ensure consistent handling of scalar operations.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now handle large values properly, avoid numerical overflow warnings, and ensure proper handling of scalar operations.
