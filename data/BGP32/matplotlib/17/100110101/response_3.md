## Analysis
The function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding them or swapping them if necessary. The function has conditions based on the magnitude of the endpoints and their difference.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` creates an `imshow` plot with specific input values, and when trying to create a colorbar, it calls the `nonsingular` function which throws a `RuntimeWarning` indicating overflow or absolute calculation issue.

The error occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is checked. The calculation `vmax - vmin` may lead to an overflow due to the type conversion when using numpy `int16` values in some cases, causing unexpected results and errors.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from handling input values and their interaction when they are converted to `float` internally. In cases where the input values are `int16`, the automatic conversion to `float` could cause unexpected overflow behavior during calculations, leading to runtime warnings.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the input values are correctly converted and handled for calculations that involve `float` operations.
2. Modify the code to handle the specific scenario involving `int16` values to prevent overflow issues.
3. Make sure that the function correctly expands or swaps the endpoints as needed without causing any runtime warnings.

## Bug-fixed function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if float(vmax) == 0 and float(vmin) == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly converting the `vmin` and `vmax` values to `float` before performing operations involving subtraction or comparison, we prevent potential overflow issues due to the automatic conversion from `int16`. The bug-fixed version should now handle the `int16` input values correctly and prevent the occurrence of runtime warnings.
