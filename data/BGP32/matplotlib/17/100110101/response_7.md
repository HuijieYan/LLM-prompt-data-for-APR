### Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to stem from potential overflow issues when computing the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`. The function is trying to handle singular cases by adjusting the endpoints of a range, but the calculations are susceptible to errors due to data types being handled incorrectly. 

When the `maxabsvalue` becomes very large, the subsequent calculation `vmax - vmin` may result in overflow, leading to unexpected behavior and the runtime warnings observed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the overflow issues, it is important to ensure that the data types used during calculations are appropriate and not prone to overflow. Casting the values to appropriate data types before performing arithmetic operations can help prevent these issues.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmin = np.float64(vmin)
    vmax = np.float64(vmax)
    
    max_abs_value = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if max_abs_value < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(np.float64).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif np.abs(vmax - vmin) <= max_abs_value * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code ensures that calculations are performed using `np.float64` to handle potential overflow issues and casting operations are done where necessary to maintain the desired behavior.

By implementing these adjustments, the `nonsingular` function should now be able to handle the range adjustments without encountering overflow errors, while passing all the provided test cases.
