### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from a potential overflow issue when performing arithmetic operations given large input values. In the failing tests, we are encountering runtime warnings related to overflow when performing calculations with the input values. This is likely due to the fact that the function is not handling extreme input values properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `nonsingular` function to handle extreme input values (e.g., large integers) properly without causing overflow issues. This involves checking for potential overflow situations and adjusting the calculations accordingly.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    abs_range = maxabsvalue * tiny
    large_range = 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny
    if maxabsvalue < large_range and abs(vmax - vmin) <= abs_range:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / 2
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle extreme input values without causing overflow issues during calculations. This revised version is expected to pass all the test cases provided.
