### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding or swapping them if necessary. The bug seems to arise from incorrect handling of extreme values leading to overflows and runtime warnings during certain calculations.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test cases, we have instances where the input values are close to or at the boundaries that could trigger overflows in calculations. The bug arises due to an incorrect comparison or handling of the `maxabsvalue` which can lead to an erroneous conclusion when checking for extreme cases based on the ratio of the interval size to the absolute maximum value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check and modify the condition for checking the `maxabsvalue` to avoid any overflows.
2. Ensure that the values are handled within acceptable ranges to prevent runtime warnings.

### Updated `nonsingular` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

Now, the corrected function should handle extreme cases without encountering overflows and pass the failing tests without any runtime warnings.
