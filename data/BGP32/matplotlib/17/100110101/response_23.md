## Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid singularities by expanding or swapping them if necessary. The function checks for infinities or NaN values first and then handles cases where the range is too small or close to zero by expanding them.

The bug seems to be related to a potential overflow issue when performing operations involving very large or very small numbers represented as `int16`, leading to a `RuntimeWarning`. This bug is triggered when the input values are at the limits of what can be represented by `int16`.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `nonsingular` fails when working with input values represented as `int16` due to potential overflow issues in calculations involving these values. The `maxabsvalue` calculation can cause a `RuntimeWarning` when the integers represented by `int16` exceed the range of values that can be accurately managed by this data type.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, the function needs to ensure that it works correctly with values represented as `int16`. Since the operations involve float-point calculations, the function should convert the input values to `float` for consistent processing. By converting the input values to floating-point numbers at the beginning of the function, the issues related to overflow during calculations can be avoided.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float to avoid overflow in calculations
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Convert to float to avoid overflow in calculations
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should handle the input values correctly, avoiding overflow issues related to working with `int16` values.
