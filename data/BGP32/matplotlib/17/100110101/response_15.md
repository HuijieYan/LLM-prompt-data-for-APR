### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It handles the cases where the input values are infinite or non-finite. The error occurs due to potential overflow problems when performing operations on the input values.

1. The error message indicates "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute". This suggests that there is an overflow issue when subtracting two values or taking the absolute value of a very large negative number.
   
2. The failing test cases involve providing extreme values like `-32768` and `20000`, which might trigger the overflow issues.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by comparing or performing arithmetic operations on integers that may overflow when converted to floating-point numbers during computations. This leads to incorrect behavior and triggers a RuntimeWarning due to the overflow encountered.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all calculations involving input values are done using floating-point numbers to mitigate potential overflow issues. This can be achieved by converting the input values to float early in the computation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    # Convert input values to float to avoid overflow issues
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander

        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly casts the input values to float to avoid any integer overflow issues during computations. The function should now handle extreme values without triggering the RuntimeWarning.
