### Analysis
The bug occurs when the function encounters a situation where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is small enough that it leads to an overflow error. This happens in the case where the range of values is not significant enough compared to the `tiny` threshold.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function checks if `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This check is intended to expand the interval if it is too small relative to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints. However, the calculation `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` leads to a value that causes an overflow error when multiplied by `tiny`. This calculation is meant to prevent approaching the double precision resolution limit, but it causes an issue in specific cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition that checks for the interval's size relative to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. We should revise this condition to prevent overflow and still accurately reflect the intention of the check.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    max_rel_diff = np.finfo(float).max * tiny
    if (vmax - vmin) / max_rel_diff <= maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version avoids the overflow issue by introducing a new calculation `max_rel_diff` to prevent oversized computations. It retains the original intention of the input range expansion based on the `tiny` threshold.
