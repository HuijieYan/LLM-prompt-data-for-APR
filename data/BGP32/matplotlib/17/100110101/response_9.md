## Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function checks for input values that are infinite and handles them accordingly. However, there are issues with handling numerical calculations that could lead to errors like overflow or warnings.

The failing test in `test_colorbar_int` involves creating an image plot with specific limits and then creating a colorbar based on that plot. The failure occurs when calculating the max absolute value of the endpoints inside the `nonsingular` function, resulting in overflow and warnings.

## Bug Explanation
- In Case 5 and Case 7, the input values are quite large, leading to the calculation of the `maxabsvalue` exceeding the threshold that triggers the `overflow` and `RuntimeWarning` messages.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should adjust the calculation involving `maxabsvalue` to avoid overflow and warnings. One way to address the issue is by normalizing the endpoints with smaller values to prevent overly large computations.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    norm_limit = 1e6 / tiny
    
    if maxabsvalue < norm_limit * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / norm_limit
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / norm_limit

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle large input values without triggering overflow errors or warnings. It ensures that the calculations stay within reasonable bounds to avoid such issues.
