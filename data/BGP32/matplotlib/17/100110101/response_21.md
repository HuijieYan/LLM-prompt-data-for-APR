## Bug Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, the bug occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, which causes the function to try to subtract `vmax - vmin` where `vmin` is larger than `vmax`. This is where the overflow error occurs.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic for adjusting endpoints works correctly when subtracting `vmax - vmin`. If `vmax < vmin`, we initially adjust `vmax` and `vmin` values before calculating `maxabsvalue`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:  # Check for very small interval
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = 0.5 * (vmin + vmax) - expander
            vmax = 0.5 * (vmin + vmax) + expander

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the logic to adjust the endpoints properly, this should prevent the overflow error encountered in the failing test.
