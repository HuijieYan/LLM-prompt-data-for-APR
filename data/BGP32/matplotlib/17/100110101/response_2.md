## Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is performing operations intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug seems to be related to handling extreme numerical values that lead to overflows. When the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is small, the algorithm tries to expand the range accordingly using an `expander` value. However, in the presence of extreme values like `int16`, the calculations lead to overflows and numerical errors.

## Bug Explanation
1. In Case 5, the input values are `-20000` and `20000`, which are within the limits of `int16`. However, during calculations involving these values and a small `expander`, errors occur due to the overflow of data types.
2. The function was designed with float values in mind, not taking into account the constraints imposed by `int16` type values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the calculations are done with appropriate data types to avoid overflow issues. We may need to convert the input values to float, perform the calculations with float precision, and then optionally convert the result back to the desired data type if needed.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

By converting the input `vmin` and `vmax` to float at the beginning of the function and performing the calculations with float precision, we can avoid the overflow and numerical errors encountered with extreme integer values. This fix should allow the function to handle extreme values more robustly.
