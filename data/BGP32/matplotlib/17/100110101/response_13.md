## Bug Analysis

### Understanding the Bug
The `nonsingular` function is supposed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, the bug arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, triggering an overflow error due to numeric limitations.

The failing test cases involve large or small integer values that result in an overflow issue when converted to floats within the `nonsingular` function.

### Bug Location
The bug arises in the following section of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
```
Here, the calculation `vmax - vmin` can lead to an overflow error if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too small compared to the magnitude of their absolute values (`maxabsvalue`).

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the calculation `vmax - vmin` can lead to an overflow if `vmax` is close to `vmin` but has opposite signs, causing the subtraction to result in a large value that leads to overflow.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `vmax` and `vmin` are very close to each other but may have opposite signs to prevent overflow. Adjustments need to be made to avoid calculations that could lead to overflow.

## Bug Fix
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        ratio = (vmax - vmin) / maxabsvalue
        if abs(ratio) <= tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin = 0.5 * (vmin + vmax) - 0.5 * expander
                vmax = 0.5 * (vmin + vmax) + 0.5 * expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

## Final Notes
The fixed `nonsingular` function properly handles the case where the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small by calculating a midpoint instead of relying on the unstable difference calculation. This ensures the function won't run into overflow issues in such scenarios.
