### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify input endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid singularities by adjusting them based on certain conditions. The function tries to handle cases where the input is infinite or non-finite and cases where endpoints are swapped. It also checks for the size of the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` and applies adjustments accordingly.

The failing tests demonstrate that the function is not handling extreme input values properly, resulting in overflow warnings due to scalar operations. The function is not expanding the interval correctly in these cases, leading to incorrect results and potential errors.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The function does not handle extreme values like `inf`, `-inf`, `int16`, and large floats properly, resulting in overflow warnings.
2. The logic for adjusting endpoints based on their sizes is not accurately calculating the new values in cases where the interval is small.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to properly handle extreme cases like `inf`, `-inf`, `int16`, and large floats without causing overflow warnings.
2. Improve the logic for adjusting endpoints to ensure that the new values are calculated correctly when the interval is small.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not isinstance(vmin, (float, np.floating))) or (not isinstance(vmax, (float, np.floating))):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if np.abs(vmin) == np.inf or np.abs(vmax) == np.inf:
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

By making these adjustments based on the bug fix strategy, the corrected `nonsingular` function should now handle extreme values correctly and avoid the overflow warnings encountered previously.
