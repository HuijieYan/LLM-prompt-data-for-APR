### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug occurs when there is an overflow encountered while performing subtraction operations within the function. This results in a `RuntimeWarning` being raised, indicating an issue with numerical calculations.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug is caused by the following lines of code in the `nonsingular` function:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
    if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
```
In this part of the code, calculations are performed to adjust the `vmin` and `vmax` values based on their difference and the ratio of their maximum absolute value. If the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is met, subtraction operations are performed on `vmin` and `vmax`, which can lead to overflow issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to change the way the adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax` values is done to prevent overflow during calculations. One approach could be to update the calculations to be more numerically stable and handle edge cases where overflow might occur.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Numerically stable adjustment
            if abs(vmin) < abs(vmax):
                delta_vmin = np.sign(vmin) * expander
                delta_vmax = delta_vmin * abs(vmax / vmin)
            else:
                delta_vmax = np.sign(vmax) * expander
                delta_vmin = delta_vmax * abs(vmin / vmax)
                
            vmin -= delta_vmin
            vmax += delta_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Summary
By updating the calculation logic in the `nonsingular` function to be more numerically stable, we can avoid overflow issues and ensure that the function behaves correctly. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected results without any runtime warnings.
