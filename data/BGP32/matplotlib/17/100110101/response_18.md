### Analysis
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding or swapping them as needed. The issue seems to arise when dealing with integer inputs in the failing test cases where overflow errors occur during subtraction or taking absolute values.

### Bug
The bug lies in how the function processes integer inputs, leading to overflow errors during calculations involving these values. Specifically, when handling integer inputs in the failing test cases, the function cannot perform the necessary calculations correctly due to treating them as integers rather than floating-point numbers.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles integer inputs by converting them to floating-point numbers early on to prevent overflow errors during calculations. By ensuring that all arithmetic operations are performed using floating-point values, we can avoid the overflow issues encountered in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)  # Convert inputs to float

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

By converting the input values to floating-point numbers early in the function, the corrected version should prevent overflow errors when dealing with integer inputs. This fix ensures that the calculations are performed correctly and should pass the failing test cases.
