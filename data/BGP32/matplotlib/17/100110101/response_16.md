## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to arithmetic operations that can lead to overflow issues due to large numerical values. When the difference (`vmax - vmin`) is calculated using `vmin` and `vmax` within a certain range, it may lead to overflow errors if the numbers are too large relative to each other.

In the failing test, when `clim = (-20000, 20000)` and the function is called with `vmin = -20000` and `vmax = 20000`, it triggers a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` due to the subtraction operation (`vmax - vmin`) being performed with large values, causing numerical overflow.

Additionally, when `clim = (-32768, 0)` in the failing test, the same overflow issue arises due to another large difference between `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the arithmetic operations in the `nonsingular` function to handle cases where the numerical range is large, preventing overflow issues. One common strategy is to avoid direct manipulations based on the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` for very large numbers.

We can modify the function to directly check if the input values are within a certain range and adjust them accordingly, rather than relying on calculations that may lead to overflow.

## The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    max_range = 1e6 / tiny
    if vmax - vmin < max_range * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = max(vmin, vmax), min(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version of the function directly checks if the input values fall within a certain range and applies adjustments accordingly, avoiding potential overflow issues. This should address the problem observed in the failing tests.
