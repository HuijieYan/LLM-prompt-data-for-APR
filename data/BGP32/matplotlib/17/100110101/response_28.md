### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to handle cases where the endpoint values `vmin` and `vmax` might lead to singularities. It adjusts these values based on the provided parameters to avoid such issues.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is attempting to create a color bar with specific clim values, but the `nonsingular` function encounters issues due to an overflow when performing arithmetic operations. This triggers RuntimeWarnings.

### Bug
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the calculations related to determining whether the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small or not. When the difference `vmax - vmin` is very close to zero, overflow issues occur during comparison operations or when trying to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. This results in RuntimeWarnings, causing the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we can modify the condition where we check for very small intervals. By considering both `vmin` and `vmax` independently for deciding whether to adjust the endpoints, we can prevent the overflow issue. Additionally, it's essential to handle negative values correctly and ensure that the returned values are of float type.

### The Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander if vmin >= 0 else -expander
                vmax += expander if vmax >= 0 else -expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

This corrected version ensures that the endpoint values are treated correctly, avoiding overflow issues and returning float values as expected. Additionally, it addresses the negative value handling in calculation adjustments.
