## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very close to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints multiplied by the `tiny` threshold. The function encounters an overflow warning when trying to compute this difference due to floating-point precision issues and comparing values beyond their representable range.

To fix this bug, we must ensure that the comparison of `vmax - vmin` does not lead to overflow. One possible solution is to compare the absolute difference to a threshold instead, to avoid issues with large numbers.

## Bug Fix
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    max_diff = maxabsvalue * tiny
    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= max_diff:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This fix replaces the problematic comparison `vmax - vmin` with `abs(vmax - vmin)` compared to `max_diff` to prevent the overflow issue. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is within the threshold defined by `tiny`.
