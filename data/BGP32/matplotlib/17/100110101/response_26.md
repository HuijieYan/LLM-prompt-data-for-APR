### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. These warnings indicate that there are potential overflow issues when performing arithmetic operations on very large or small numbers.

The problem occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too small or when calculating the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`, leading to numerical precision issues that trigger an overflow warning.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle potential overflow issues that arise from performing arithmetic calculations on floating-point numbers that could lead to very small or very large values.

To ensure numerical stability and avoid overflow issues, we should perform arithmetic operations carefully, considering the input values and the expected result ranges. Additionally, we should handle edge cases where values are too close to zero or when performing operations on very large numbers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the overflow issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif np.isclose(vmax - vmin, 0, abs_tol=1e-15):
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0, abs_tol=1e-15) and np.isclose(vmin, 0, abs_tol=1e-15):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function modifies the endpoints of a range while handling potential overflow issues and ensuring numerical stability. The changes made aim to prevent overflow warnings and ensure that the function behaves correctly for different input scenarios.
