## Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is meant to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions like the size of the interval and the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. The error seems to be related to handling floating-point calculations, potentially leading to overflow or other numerical issues.

Looking at the failing test and error messages, it's evident that the function is not handling extreme cases properly, resulting in overflow warnings during calculations.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of extreme cases where the input values are near the maximum or minimum representable values for numerical types. Specifically, when taking the absolute value of very large or very small values, the function encounters floating-point overflow warnings.

## Bug Fix
To address the issue with the buggy function, we need to update the logic to avoid numerical overflow and properly handle extreme cases. This may involve adjusting the way values are calculated and ensuring that the calculations stay within reasonable bounds to prevent overflow.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval < tiny or maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin = vmin - expander*maxabsvalue
            vmax = vmax + expander*maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This updated version should address the overflow issues and ensure correct behavior for extreme cases.
