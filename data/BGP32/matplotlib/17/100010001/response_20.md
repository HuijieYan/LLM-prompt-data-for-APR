### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there are potential overflows occurring due to the subtraction and calculation of absolute values in the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, there are warning messages related to overflow encountered in scalar arithmetic operations.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the potential overflow during calculations within the `nonsingular` function, particularly in the section where the absolute values and differences between `vmin` and `vmax` are being calculated.

### Fix:
To address the bug and prevent potential overflows, specifically in the `maxabsvalue` calculation and the condition checking for tiny intervals, we should perform error checks and preventive measures to mitigate the overflow errors.

### Plan to fix the bug:
1. Handle the overflow and underflow scenarios by explicitly checking for potential issues during absolute value calculations and differences between `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Adjust the calculations to ensure that any operation is within the appropriate range to avoid overflowing based on the data types used.
3. Implement a strategy to expand the interval appropriately without causing overflows.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < 1e-12 and abs(vmin) < 1e-12:  # Checking for small values
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these adjustments and handling potential overflow scenarios, the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should prevent the reported overflow errors and improve the stability of the calculations.
