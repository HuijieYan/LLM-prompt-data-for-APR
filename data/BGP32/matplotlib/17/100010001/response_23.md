#### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an overflow encounter in subtracting two values or in calculating the absolute value of a scalar. The error is likely due to calculations within the `nonsingular` function that are causing overflow or unexpected behavior.

#### Bug Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`: This condition can cause an overflow error due to subtracting large numbers.
2. `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`: Calculating the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` could lead to an overflow issue.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function performs arithmetic calculations with large floating-point values, leading to an overflow error. This issue arises when either the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` becomes very large, causing the subsequent calculations to trigger overflow warnings.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations in the `nonsingular` function do not lead to overflow errors or unexpected behavior. Specifically, we can check for potential overflow conditions when performing arithmetic operations involving large numbers.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e-6:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

#### Changes Made:
1. Modify the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` to a more appropriate threshold of `maxabsvalue < 1e-6` to avoid overflow issues.
2. Change the calculations `vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)` and `vmax += expander*abs(vmax)` to directly subtract and add the expander value, respectively.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should address the overflow issues and prevent the errors encountered during the test execution.
