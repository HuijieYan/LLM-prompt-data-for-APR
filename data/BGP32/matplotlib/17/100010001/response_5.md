### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" occurred in the `nonsingular` function within the `transforms.py` file. The issue seems to be related to computations involving large values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to compute the absolute value of extremely large integers (e.g., -32768) leading to an overflow.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the computation of the absolute value does not result in an overflow when dealing with very large integers.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    try:
        abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    except OverflowError:
        abs_vmin = np.sign(vmin) * float('inf')
    
    try:
        abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    except OverflowError:
        abs_vmax = np.sign(vmax) * float('inf')
        
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version handles extremely large integers by using a `try-except` block to avoid triggering an overflow error, ensuring a proper calculation of the absolute values within the function.
