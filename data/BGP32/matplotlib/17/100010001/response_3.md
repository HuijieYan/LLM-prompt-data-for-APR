### Analysis:
1. The `RuntimeWarning` is due to potential overflow encountered during the subtraction operation in the `nonsingular` function.
2. The warning messages indicate that the overflow occurs when calculating the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` or when calculating the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
3. This overflow often occurs when working with values close to the limits of integer representations, as seen with the inputs provided in the failing tests.
4. To prevent overflow, we need to ensure that the calculations are done with appropriate data types and ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To address the overflow issues, we will convert `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` type early on to avoid integer arithmetic constraints.
2. We will also explicitly convert intermediate values to `float` where necessary to prevent implicit casting to integers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    # Convert to float early to avoid possible integer arithmetic constraints
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Calculate maximum absolute value correctly
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

After applying the corrections, the `RuntimeWarning` related to overflow encountered during arithmetic operations should be resolved.
