### Analysis:
The bug is likely located in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` within the `nonsingular` function. The error message indicates "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute", which suggests that there might be large values causing overflow issues during arithmetic operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to trying to calculate the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`) using the `max` function with `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` when the values are too large. This leads to overflow issues during the calculations, resulting in the error messages.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the way `maxabsvalue` is calculated to avoid potential overflow issues with large values. One way to address this is by explicitly handling cases where the values are large and adjusting the calculation accordingly.

### Updated/Copied Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints. If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded. This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    maxabsvalue_threshold = 1e6 / tiny
    if maxabsvalue < maxabsvalue_threshold or (vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * maxabsvalue_threshold
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By updating the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to include an additional check against `maxabsvalue_threshold` and handling cases where values are zero, this corrected version of the function should address the overflow issues reported by the failing tests.
