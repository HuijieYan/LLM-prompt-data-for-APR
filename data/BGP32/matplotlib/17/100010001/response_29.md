The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, where the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` is raised due to an overflow error when attempting to take the absolute value of a large negative number. This occurs when `vmax` is negative.

To fix this issue, we can modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to handle negative values properly by first taking the absolute value and then comparing it to ensure correct calculations. Additionally, `tiny` and `expander` values can also be adjusted to improve robustness.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    
    # Calculate the absolute values of vmin and vmax
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny or abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
        vmax += expander * abs_vmax
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this fix, the `nonsingular` function should be able to handle the input values properly and avoid the overflow errors that were occurring before.
