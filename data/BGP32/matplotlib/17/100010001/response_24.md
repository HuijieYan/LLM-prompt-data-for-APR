### Analysis
The error messages show that there are overflow issues encountered while performing arithmetic operations inside the `nonsingular` function, specifically with subtraction and taking the absolute value.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug arises when calculating `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, where `abs(vmin)` can lead to an overflow.
2. Another bug occurs in the `elif` condition block where it checks `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, this operation may cause an overflow as well.
3. The error message also suggests issues with taking the scalar absolute value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. When calculating the `maxabsvalue`, ensure that an overflow does not occur by handling the absolute values properly.
2. Address the potential for overflow in the subtraction operation `vmax - vmin`.
3. Handle the absolute value computation more safely to prevent potential overflow issues.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = np.abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = np.abs(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should prevent the overflow issues and pass the failing tests.
