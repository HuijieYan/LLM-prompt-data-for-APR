### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there are overflow issues when taking the absolute value and scalar subtraction operations on some values within the `nonsingular()` function. The issue seems to arise when dealing with large values like -20000 and 20000 or -32768 and 0, causing the function to run into runtime warnings related to overflow errors and absolute value calculations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing `vmax` and `vmin` with potential swapping.
2. Calculation involving `maxabsvalue` by taking the maximum of absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
3. Calculation for expanding the range based on certain conditions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling large values properly, leading to overflow issues during calculations such as subtraction and absolute value operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculations within the function `nonsingular()` to handle large values without encountering overflow errors. Specifically, when dealing with values close to the limits of the data type, extra care needs to be taken to avoid calculations that may result in overflow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e12 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the value `1e6` was changed to `1e12` to increase the limit for large values. Additionally, the calculation for `vmax - vmin` was changed to use the `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` instead of `maxabsvalue` to avoid issues with the calculation. These changes should help prevent overflow-related errors and handle large values properly.
