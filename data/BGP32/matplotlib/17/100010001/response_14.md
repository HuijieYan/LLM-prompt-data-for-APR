### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the subtraction operation that occurs when checking the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`.
2. The error is related to floating-point operations that lead to an overflow issue when dealing with large values.
3. The `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line raises a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` due to extreme values in `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to handle extreme values properly and prevent overflow issues during arithmetic operations.
   
### Fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Correction:
Adjusted the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` to `maxabsvalue < tiny` to avoid overflow with large values. Additionally, fixed the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to check if the difference is less than `tiny` to prevent overflow issues.

This corrected version should address the overflow encountered in the subtraction and absolute value operations mentioned in the error messages.
