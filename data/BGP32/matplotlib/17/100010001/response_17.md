### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there are overflow issues with the absolute function and scalar operations inside the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, the `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` as well as `vmax - vmin` operations are causing overflow warnings due to the absolute value or subtraction.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to take the absolute value of a value that exceeds the datatype limit, causing an overflow. This issue arises when dealing with large integer values that are converted to floating-point numbers, resulting in conversion errors and potential overflows during calculations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations involving absolute values and arithmetic operations do not exceed the limits of the data type being used. One approach is to convert the values to floating-point numbers earlier in the process to avoid issues related to integer conversion and overflow.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmax_float = float(vmax)
    vmin_float = float(vmin)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin_float), abs(vmax_float))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax_float - vmin_float <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax_float == 0 and vmin_float == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function ensures that the calculations are performed using floating-point values, avoiding overflow issues from converting large integers to floating-point numbers directly. By converting the values to floating-point numbers early in the process, we prevent potential overflow during absolute value and arithmetic operations.
