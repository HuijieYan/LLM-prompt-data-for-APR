### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there are overflow issues occurring within the `nonsingular` function when calculating the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. This is leading to a `RuntimeWarning` due to overflow encountered during the calculation.

### Issue:
The error occurs when the function tries to calculate the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. The calculation is causing overflow and the function's logic needs to be adjusted in order to prevent this issue.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the issue, we can rewrite the logic within the `nonsingular` function to avoid overflow when calculating the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
