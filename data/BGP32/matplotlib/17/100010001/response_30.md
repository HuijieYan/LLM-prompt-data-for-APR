### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug occurs when the `maxabsvalue` calculation leads to overflow errors. This is due to the use of `abs()` function on 16-bit integers (`np.int16`) which can lead to overflow.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of `abs()` function on `np.int16` values in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. When the values are close to the upper or lower bounds of a 16-bit integer representation, applying `abs()` can result in overflow issues. This causes the subsequent calculations to produce overflow errors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the conversion to `np.int16` should be delayed until after applying the `abs()` function to avoid overflow issues. By converting to `np.int16` after taking the absolute value, we ensure that we don't encounter overflow problems during the calculation.

### The corrected function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Delay the conversion to np.int16 until after absolute value calculation
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should no longer produce overflow errors when dealing with `np.int16` values.
