### Analysis:
The `RuntimeWarning` occurs in the `nonsingular` function when calculating the `maxabsvalue` due to potential overflow encountered in scalar absolute. This error is triggered in two different tests with inputs `(-20000, 20000)` and `(-32768, 0)`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `max()` function called with `abs()` on `vmin` and `vmax` can result in overflowing when the input values are at the extreme limits. This leads to the runtime warning during the calculation process.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the way `maxabsvalue` is calculated to avoid potential overflow issues when dealing with the `abs()` of large values.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))  # Updated to use np.abs() to avoid overflow issue
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Updated Code Explanation:
- Modified the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to use `np.abs()` instead of the built-in `abs()` function to avoid potential overflow.
- By using `np.abs()`, we ensure that the absolute values are calculated correctly even for large input values, preventing the overflow issue.
- This updated version should resolve the `RuntimeWarning` encountered during the calculation process.
