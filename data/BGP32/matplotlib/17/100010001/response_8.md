### Analysis:
- The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
- The error message indicates a `RuntimeWarning` related to overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute.
- The issue arises when `vmax` is negative and `vmin` is positive, leading to overflow in absolute value calculations.
- The warning suggests that there might be overflow when attempting scalar subtract or take the absolute of large numbers due to the absolute value of `-32768`, which is beyond the representable range of `int16`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the overflow issues, we need to handle the cases where the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` could potentially lead to overflow during calculations. This can be achieved by making adjustments to the `nonsingular` function logic.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # Handle cases where overflow may occur in absolute value calculations
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if vmax < 0:
                vmax -= expander * abs(vmax)
            else:
                vmax += expander * vmax

            if vmin < 0:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            else:
                vmin += expander * vmin

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the adjustments as shown above, we handle the cases involving negative `vmin` or `vmax` values correctly and prevent overflow issues that lead to the `RuntimeWarning`.
