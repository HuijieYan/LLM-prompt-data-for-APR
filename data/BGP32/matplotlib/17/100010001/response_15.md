The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to potential arithmetic overflow errors when dealing with large values. The function tries to ensure that the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is not too small by expanding it if necessary. However, the comparison logic and calculations can lead to overflow warnings and incorrect results in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the arithmetic operations more carefully and efficiently. We should revise how the interval size is determined and expanded to avoid potential overflows.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version:
- We calculate the interval size as `vmax - vmin` before comparing it to the threshold.
- We consider the expansion based on the maximum of `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` within the interval to avoid issues with small values.
- The logic has been modified to handle the expansion and interval size comparison more effectively.

These changes should address the potential arithmetic overflow and comparison issues, ensuring that the function works correctly for a range of input values and intervals.
