### Analysis
The `RuntimeWarning` encountered in the failing tests points to potential overflow issues within the `nonsingular` function when calculating the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. Specifically, the error occurs when taking the absolute value of the endpoint values where they are close to the minimum possible integer representation, such as `-32768`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the handling of integer values that are being converted to floats within the `nonsingular` function. When converting integer values like `-32768` to float and then taking the absolute value, it can lead to an overflow warning due to the large difference between the minimum negative integer value and zero.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the special case when dealing with integer endpoints that are close to the minimum integer point. We need to convert the input integer values `vmin` and `vmax` to float before calculating the maximum absolute value.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.
    
    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Convert to float
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function now ensures that the input endpoints are converted to floats before any calculations involving absolute values are performed. This modification prevents the integer to float conversion issue that caused the overflow warnings and ensures proper function behavior.
