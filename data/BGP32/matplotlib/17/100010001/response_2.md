### Analysis:
1. The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It checks if the endpoints are finite and swaps them if `vmin` is greater than `vmax`.
2. The errors are related to overflow encountered in scalar subtract and absolute operations within the function due to the large values of `vmin` and `vmax`. This is causing the `maxabsvalue` calculation to result in overflow.
3. The error messages indicate that the overflow issues are occurring due to the large values of `vmin` and `vmax` provided in the failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the overflow scenarios by adjusting the approach used to calculate `maxabsvalue` and modifying the conditional logic accordingly to avoid overflow issues.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to prevent overflow by considering a different approach to calculate the maximum absolute value.
2. Check if the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero and handle those cases separately to prevent overflow.
3. Adjust the conditional logic to ensure that the modifications to `vmin` and `vmax` are handled safely without encountering overflow issues.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    denom = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if denom == 0:
        denom = tiny

    if vmax - vmin <= denom * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    return (vmin, vmax) if increasing else (vmax, vmin)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a condition to check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero to return the adjusted values `-expander, expander` directly to avoid overflow.
2. Calculated a denominator `denom` based on the maximum of absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` to handle the cases when either or both values could be zero.
3. Used this `denom` in place of `maxabsvalue` in the calculation to avoid overflow scenarios.
4. Rearranged the return statement at the end to ensure the correct order of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter.

By making these adjustments, the corrected `nonsingular` function should now handle the large values without encountering overflow issues and pass the failing tests.
