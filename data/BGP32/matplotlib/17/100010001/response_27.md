**Bug Analysis:**
The error message indicates that there are overflow errors in the function `nonsingular`. Specifically, the error messages mention overflow in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations. This suggests that the calculations being performed result in values that exceed the range of representable values, causing an overflow.

**Bug Location:**
The potential bug locations in the function are the calculations involving `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`.

**Cause of the Bug:**
In cases where the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are large (as in the failing test cases), the calculations involving them are causing overflows. This is because the function does not handle large values well and leads to computational errors.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculations and conditions in the `nonsingular` function to handle large input values appropriately and prevent overflow. Specifically, we need to revise how the expansion and swapping logic is applied to avoid exceeding the range of representable values.

**Corrected Function:**
```python
from numpy.core.numerictypes import maximum_sctype, abuse_error, absolute

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = maximum_sctype([absolute(vmin), absolute(vmax)])
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*absolute(vmin)
            vmax += expander*absolute(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these adjustments, the code should now properly handle large input values without causing computational overflows.
