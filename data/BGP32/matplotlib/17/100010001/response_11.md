### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The two error messages are related to `RuntimeWarning` about overflow encountered in subtraction or absolute function. This indicates a potential issue with calculations involved in determining the endpoints of the range.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when determining the `maxabsvalue` using the `abs` function to calculate the maximum value between `vmin` and `vmax`. The error message indicates that an overflow occurs in taking the absolute value of very negative numbers such as `-20000` or `-32768`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we can modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to prevent overflow errors. One way to approach this is by checking if `abs` applied directly to the negative extremum value overflows and reducing it to a smaller value.  

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmin_abs = max(abs(vmin), np.nextafter(0, 1))  # Handle overflow by preventing negative extremum
    vmax_abs = max(abs(vmax), np.nextafter(0, 1))  # Handle overflow by preventing negative extremum
    maxabsvalue = max(vmin_abs, vmax_abs)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using `np.nextafter(0, 1)` when calculating `vmin_abs` and `vmax_abs`, we ensure that we handle the overflow for absolute value calculation correctly and prevent negative extremum. This correction should fix the bug and prevent overflow errors encountered previously.
