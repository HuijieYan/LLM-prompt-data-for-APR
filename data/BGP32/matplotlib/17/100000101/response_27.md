The bug in the `nonsingular` function resides within the calculation of the `maxabsvalue` variable and deciding whether to expand the interval or not. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is incorrect and causes improper handling of very small intervals.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditions for deciding when to expand the range. We can compare the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` against a threshold based on `tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version compares the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` directly against the `tiny` threshold for expanding the range, ensuring proper handling of small intervals. This change aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
