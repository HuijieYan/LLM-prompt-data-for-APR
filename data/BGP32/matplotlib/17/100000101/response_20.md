The bug in the given function arises from the checks and adjustments made for extremely small intervals and when both inputs are 0 or close to 0, which can result in incorrect adjustments of the endpoints.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves reworking the conditional statements to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly while considering the edge cases where both inputs are 0 or very close to 0.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:  # Adjust for both inputs are close to 0
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= (vmax - vmin) / 2
            vmax += (vmax - vmin) / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now correctly adjust the endpoints while considering small intervals and the scenario where both inputs are close to zero. This version should satisfy all the expected input/output values.
