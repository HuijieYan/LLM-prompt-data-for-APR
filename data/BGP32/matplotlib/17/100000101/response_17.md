The bug in the function `nonsingular` is related to the condition when checking if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`. The bug leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition by considering the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` when calculating their difference. We also need to include additional checks for special cases when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
        
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling the condition for checking the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with their absolute values. It also includes a specific check for the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero.
