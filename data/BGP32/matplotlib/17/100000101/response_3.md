The buggy function has a logical error when determining if the input range is too small and needs to be expanded. The condition for expanding the interval based on the ratio between the interval size and the maximum absolute value of its endpoints is incorrect.

In the buggy function, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is used to check if the interval is smaller than the threshold and needs to be expanded. This condition may not correctly address edge cases when dealing with very small intervals. A better approach would be to compare the interval size directly to the threshold, without considering the value of `maxabsvalue`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition for expanding the interval based on the threshold. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval_size = vmax - vmin
    if interval_size < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function directly compares the interval size (`interval_size`) to the threshold (`tiny`) to determine if the interval needs to be expanded. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the interval is very small.
