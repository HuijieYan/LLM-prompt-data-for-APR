The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where it is checking if `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to determine if the endpoints need to be expanded. There are potential issues in handling edge cases such as when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to 0.

To fix this bug, you can adjust the condition and handle specific cases where both endpoints are 0. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    condition = vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny
    if condition:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:  # handle both endpoints being 0
            vmin = vmin - expander
            vmax = vmax + expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the expected cases provided. It handles the edge cases where both endpoints are 0 or close to 0 correctly, ensuring that the expansion is done appropriately.
