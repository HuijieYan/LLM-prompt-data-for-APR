### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` aims to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function checks for singularities condition and adjusts the endpoints accordingly. However, there are issues in handling very small intervals and swapped inputs that lead to incorrect outputs.

### Bugs
1. When `vmax - vmin` is very small compared to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, the function incorrectly expands the range.
2. When swapping `vmin` and `vmax`, the function should also consider the `increasing` parameter, but it does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the condition for expanding the range to only trigger when the interval is significantly smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny`.
2. Update the swapping logic to consider the `increasing` flag properly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        if not increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should address the identified issues and provide the expected outputs for all test cases.
