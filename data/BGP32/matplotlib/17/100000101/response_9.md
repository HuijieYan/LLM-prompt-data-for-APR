The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the comparison inside the if condition where it checks if the interval is too small based on `tiny`. This comparison can lead to incorrect results due to computational precision issues.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition to consider the scaled absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`, rather than just the absolute difference itself.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    absdiff = abs(vmax - vmin)
    scale = maxabsvalue * tiny

    if absdiff < scale:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect comparison when checking the interval size and should now return the expected values for all provided test cases.
