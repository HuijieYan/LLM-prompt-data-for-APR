The bug in the provided function lies in the condition check for deciding whether to expand the range or not. The current implementation is incorrect because it uses `np.finfo(float).tiny` which represents the smallest positive normalized representable number in floating point. This value is quite small and does not play a correct role in expanding the range appropriately.

To fix the bug, one can use `tiny` directly in the comparison instead of `np.finfo(float).tiny`. This change ensures that the threshold for checking whether the interval should be expanded or not is relative to the provided `tiny` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version uses the `tiny` parameter directly in the comparison, ensuring that the condition for expanding the interval is correctly applied. It addresses the bug in the function and should now correctly handle the given test cases.
