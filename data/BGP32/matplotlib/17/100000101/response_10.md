The buggy function has an issue when determining if the input values are too small or if the interval is smaller than the threshold based on `tiny`. This issue leads to incorrect adjustments to the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`.

The strategy to fix the bug involves:
1. Utilizing a consistent and correct approach to check if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small based on the threshold.
2. Adjusting the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly by expanding when needed.
3. Ensuring the swapping of endpoints is handled correctly based on the `increasing` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 * tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

This corrected version improves the logic for expanding the range when necessary and handles the swapping of endpoints correctly based on the `increasing` parameter.
