The bug in the function `nonsingular` is due to incorrect logic when handling the case where `vmax - vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. The original implementation subtracted and added expander based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, which led to incorrect expansions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we expand the interval around the midpoint (`(vmin + vmax) / 2`) by `expander` on both sides rather than biasing the expansion towards `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, the order of expansion should be consistent no matter if `vmin` is greater or less than `vmax`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    mid = (vmin + vmax) / 2
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = mid - expander
            vmax = mid + expander
        else:
            vmin = mid - expander
            vmax = mid + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the mentioned issue concerning the incorrect handling of the interval expansion and should now pass all the provided test cases.
