The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of floating-point values and potential rounding errors. For example, in the case where the interval is very small, comparing it to `maxabsvalue * tiny` can lead to unexpected behavior due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers.

To fix this, we can modify the condition involving the comparison of vmin and vmax intervals to avoid errors related to floating-point precision. We can use an updated condition that involves direct comparison with a small value proportional to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints instead of comparing the interval size directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should address the precision-related issues and provide the expected outputs for all the test cases provided.
