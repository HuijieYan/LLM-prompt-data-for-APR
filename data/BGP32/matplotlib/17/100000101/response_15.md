### Analysis
The buggy function has several potential error locations that could lead to incorrect results:
1. Swapping the `vmin` and `vmax` values under a condition without updating the `swapped` flag correctly.
2. Calculating the `maxabsvalue` based on the swapped values if they are swapped, which might produce incorrect results.
3. Determining whether to expand the interval based on the swapped values, but not reversing the expansion adjustments when the interval is expanded under certain conditions.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs due to incorrect handling of the `swapped` flag. When the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped, the variables `maxabsvalue` and the interval expansion calculations should consider the absolute values of the original variables, not the swapped values. This inconsistency leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the values are swapped.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that we handle the `swapped` flag correctly throughout the function. When the values are swapped, we need to make adjustments considering the original values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin  # Swap vmin and vmax
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if not swapped and maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin if not swapped else vmax)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax if not swapped else vmin)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function ensures that the `swapped` flag is handled correctly and the calculations consider the correct values of `vmin` and `vmax` even if they are swapped. The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
