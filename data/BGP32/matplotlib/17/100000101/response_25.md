After analyzing the buggy function, the potential error lies in the if conditions where the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are being compared and possibly swapped. The bug causes incorrect adjustments to endpoints in some cases, leading to unexpected results.

The issue arises specifically when the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are close to each other and the original interval is too small. In such cases, the function is not expanding the interval correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments to the endpoints.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the `elif` block that focuses on expanding the interval. We should also ensure that the swapped flag is correctly set based on the condition in which `vmax` is less than `vmin`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to incorrect endpoint adjustments and ensures that the swapping of values is done correctly. The function should now produce the expected results provided in the test cases.
