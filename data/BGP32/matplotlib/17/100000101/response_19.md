The buggy function has an issue with the condition in the block where the interval is small. It incorrectly checks if `vmax==0 and vmin==0`, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The correct condition for small intervals should be based on their difference, not individual values.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the calculation block for small intervals. Instead of checking if `vmax==0 and vmin==0`, we should directly compare their difference with the tolerance value. Additionally, we should adjust the condition where `vmax < vmin` to ensure it handles values that are very close to each other correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        diff = abs(vmax - vmin)
        if diff < tiny:
            vmin = (vmin - expander) if vmin < 0 else (vmin + expander)
            vmax = (vmax + expander) if vmax > 0 else (vmax - expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should now handle the small interval condition correctly as per the expected input/output values.
