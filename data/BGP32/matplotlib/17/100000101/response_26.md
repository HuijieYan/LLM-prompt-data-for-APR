The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the incorrect handling of the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero. In this case, the function should return the endpoints as `-expander` and `expander`, respectively. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

To fix this bug, we need to add an additional condition to check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. If they are, the function should return `-expander` and `expander`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Handle the case where both vmin and vmax are close to zero
    if abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected values for all the test cases provided.
