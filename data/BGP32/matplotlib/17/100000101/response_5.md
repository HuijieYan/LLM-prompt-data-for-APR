The bug in the current implementation is that the function doesn't consider the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or zero itself. In those cases, it should return the values `-expander` and `expander`. However, the function only accounts for the situation where one of them is zero.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or zero. We also need to update the expected values of `vmin` and `vmax` in the test cases accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:  # Modified condition to address both vmin and vmax being zero
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The function should now correctly handle cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or zero.
