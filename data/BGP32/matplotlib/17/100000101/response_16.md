The bug in the provided function is that the condition to check if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny` is not correctly handling the zero values for `vmin` and `vmax`.

When both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` incorrectly triggers the else block, leading to the wrong expansion of the interval.

To fix this bug, we need to add an additional check in the same condition to specifically handle the case when `vmin` and `vmax` are both close to zero.

Here is the corrected function incorporating this fix:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero without inappropriately expanding the interval when both are close to zero.
