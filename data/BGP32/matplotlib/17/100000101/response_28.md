The bug in the function `nonsingular` is in how it handles cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small, leading to potential singularities. Additionally, there seems to be an unnecessary condition for `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` in determining when the interval is too small.

To fix the bug, we should simplify the logic for handling small intervals and adjust the expansion of `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        expansion = max(tiny, maxabsvalue * expander)
        vmin -= expansion
        vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

This corrected version simplifies the condition for handling small intervals and adjusts the expansion based on the maximum absolute value to ensure that potential singularities are avoided.
