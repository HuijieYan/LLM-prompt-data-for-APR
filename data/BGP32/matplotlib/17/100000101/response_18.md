The cause of the bug in the provided function is due to improper handling of the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero. In such cases, the function is not correctly expanding the range.

To fix this bug, we should add a condition to handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero. In this case, we need to set `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version now includes the additional condition to handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero. It sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander` in this situation. This correction ensures that the function properly handles all the cases mentioned in the expected input/output values.
