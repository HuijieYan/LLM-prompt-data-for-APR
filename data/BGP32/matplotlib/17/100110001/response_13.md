### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is meant to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function checks if the inputs `vmin` and `vmax` are finite, swaps them if needed, and expands them based on certain conditions. The error messages in the failing test indicate that there are overflow errors when calculating absolute values in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `maxabsvalue` is calculated using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This calculation leads to overflow errors when dealing with extreme values like -32768.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can address the issue with calculating `maxabsvalue` by changing the approach to avoid overflow errors. One possible solution is to directly calculate the maximum value without taking the absolute value and ensure no overflow occurs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxvalue = max(vmin, vmax)
    minvalue = min(vmin, vmax)
    
    if maxvalue - minvalue <= maxvalue * tiny:
        if maxvalue == 0 and minvalue == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin - vmax)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax - vmin)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should address the overflow issues and pass the failing test cases.
