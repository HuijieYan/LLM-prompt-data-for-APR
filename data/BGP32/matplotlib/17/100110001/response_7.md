## Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function has various checks to handle cases where the input values are infinite, non-finite, or very close to zero.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is related to colorbar generation and sets some extreme values for the color limits. The error message indicates that there is an overflow or a runtime warning encountered during the execution of the `nonsingular` function, specifically when calculating the `maxabsvalue`.

## Bug Identification:
The bug is likely located in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` where the function tries to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. This calculation might result in an overflow or a runtime warning due to extreme input values.

## Bug Explanation:
The `RuntimeWarning` encountered in the failing test suggests that there is an issue with an overflow during the calculation of the maximum absolute value in the `nonsingular` function. This likely happens because the function is using extreme or very large values for `vmin` and `vmax`, which lead to numerical instabilities.

## Bug Fix:
To fix this bug and prevent the overflow issue, we can adjust the calculation of `maxabsvalue` in the `nonsingular` function. Instead of directly calculating `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, we can first normalize the values by dividing them by `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` and then multiply by `maxabsvalue` to avoid numerical instabilities.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
        
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmax_abs = abs(vmax) / maxabsvalue
            vmin_abs = abs(vmin) / maxabsvalue
            vmin = max(-expander, vmin_abs) * maxabsvalue
            vmax = min(expander, vmax_abs) * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

## Additional Note:
Make sure to test this corrected function with the failing test to ensure that the overflow issue has been resolved.
