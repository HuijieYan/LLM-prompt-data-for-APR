### Analysis:
The error occurred due to overflowing and encountering runtime warnings when subtracting or calculating the absolute value of large integer values (such as `-32768`) as floats. The `nonsingular` function is not handling these large integer values properly.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that the `nonsingular` function is designed to work with floating-point values, but in the failing test cases, large integer values are passed to the function causing overflow and runtime warnings during arithmetic operations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Cast the input `vmin` and `vmax` within the `nonsingular` function to `float` before performing any arithmetic operations to avoid overflow issues.
2. Adjust the logic to handle large integer values properly during the calculation of maximum absolute value and interval comparisons.
3. Ensure that the function works correctly with both large integers and floating-point values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Cast to float to handle large integers
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Cast to float to handle large integers
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By casting `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` before any arithmetic operation, the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now handle both integer and floating-point values without causing overflow or runtime warnings.
