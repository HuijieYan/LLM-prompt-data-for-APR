### Analysis:
1. The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities in certain cases.
2. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is encountering overflow warnings while calling the `nonsingular` function, indicating a potential issue with handling extreme numeric values.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `nonsingular` function is trying to calculate `maxabsvalue` by taking the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. In cases where the input values are very large (like in the failing test), this calculation can lead to overflow warnings.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we can modify the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to avoid overflow issues with large numeric values.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using `np.maximum` to calculate the maximum absolute value, we ensure that the operation is performed element-wise and does not lead to overflow issues with large values. This corrected version should resolve the overflow warnings encountered in the failing test.
