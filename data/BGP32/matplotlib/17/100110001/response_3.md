### Analysis:
1. The `nonsingular` function is supposed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities.
2. The function checks if the input values `vmin` and `vmax` are finite. If not, it returns a default range to avoid singularities.
3. There are conditions in the function where the input values are modified based on certain calculations.
4. The failing test is related to the creation of a colorbar in Matplotlib and involves the `nonsingular` function during the process.

### Bug:
The bug appears to be related to the `maxabsvalue` calculation in the `nonsingular` function. When calculating the `maxabsvalue`, an overflow error is encountered due to values being close to the limits of the data type.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle potential overflows when calculating `maxabsvalue` inside the `nonsingular` function. One way to handle this is by using `try-except` blocks to catch the overflow errors and adjust the calculation accordingly.

### Code Fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    try:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    except OverflowError:
        maxabsvalue = np.finfo(float).max

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this fix, the `maxabsvalue` calculation takes care of potential overflows to prevent the runtime warnings encountered in the failing test. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
