The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, where an overflow error is encountered due to a large difference between `vmin` and `vmax` values. The function tries to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`, but it fails when the difference is significant.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation to handle this scenario without causing an overflow error. One way to do this is by directly checking if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is within the bounds of the double precision limit before proceeding with the calculation.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By directly checking for the condition where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is within the specified threshold `tiny`, we avoid the overflow error and ensure proper handling of the values. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
