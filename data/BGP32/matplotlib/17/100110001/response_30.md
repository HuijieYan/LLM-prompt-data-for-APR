The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` which results in the TypeError/Overflow encountered. The comparison in this condition can lead to an Overflow issue due to large numbers involved in the calculation.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition to prevent Overflow by breaking down the computation into smaller steps without losing the logic of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax <= maxabsvalue * tiny) or (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax = vmax + expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By changing the condition `(vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny)` to `(vmax <= maxabsvalue * tiny) or (vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny)`, we ensure that the computation doesn't result in Overflow. This correction should make the function work correctly with the provided test cases.
