### Analysis:
1. The function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on some conditions.
2. The failing tests are related to the `Colorbar` in `matplotlib`, where the `nonsingular` function is being called.
3. The error messages indicate overflow issues when performing subtraction or calculating absolute values within the `nonsingular` function.
4. The test cases are specifying large integer values which are causing the overflow problems within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the overflow issues encountered when working with large integer values in the `nonsingular` function. This is due to performing operations that are not suitable for large integers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, appropriate handling for large integer values needs to be implemented. Specifically, proper casting of inputs to float before calculation to prevent overflow issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)  # Cast inputs to float

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By explicitly casting `vmin` and `vmax` to float at the beginning of the function, we ensure that calculations are performed on floating-point numbers, preventing overflow issues.
