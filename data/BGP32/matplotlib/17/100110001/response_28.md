### Analysis:
1. The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions.
2. The test function `test_colorbar_int` is testing a colorbar where it uses `fig.colorbar(im)` to create the colorbar but encounters an error because of the `nonsingular` function used internally in the colorbar processing.
3. The error messages suggest that overflow issues are occurring during the calculations of `maxabsvalue` and `vmax - vmin` within the `nonsingular` function.
4. The bug is likely due to improper handling of integer values that are being converted to float for the calculations. Converting large integer values to floats directly can result in overflow issues.
  
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper casting of integer values to float before carrying out the calculations to prevent overflow issues. This can be achieved by explicitly converting the integer values to float before processing them in the `nonsingular` function.

### Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmax = float(vmax)
    vmin = float(vmin)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly converting `vmin` and `vmax` to float values in the `nonsingular` function, we prevent overflow issues that occur when directly operating on large integer values during calculations. This fix should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test.
