## Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is responsible for modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` in `test_colorbar.py` uses this function indirectly through the matplotlib library to process values for a colorbar. The error message indicates that there are overflow issues encountered while calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the calculation of the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` in the `nonsingular` function. The calculation can lead to overflow issues, as evident from the error messages indicating `overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. This overflow error happens when the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` operation is performed.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we can update how the maximum absolute value is calculated to avoid potential overflow issues. One approach is to consider the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` to determine the larger value without directly calculating the absolute values. 

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxdiff = vmax - vmin
    if abs(maxdiff) < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxdiff * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using the `maxdiff = vmax - vmin` approach, we avoid directly calculating the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, preventing the overflow issues encountered previously. This corrected version should now pass the failing test without the overflow errors.
