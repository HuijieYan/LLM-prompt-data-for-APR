## Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operation while comparing the values of `vmax` and `vmin` within the function. This occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too large.

## Bug:
The bug occurs due to the computation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` which can result in an overflow if the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are too large, causing the subsequent operations to encounter overflow issues.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the overflow issue when calculating the `maxabsvalue`. One approach to handle this is to separately handle cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are very large numbers causing overflow in the absolute function.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)

    if abs_vmax < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs_vmax - abs_vmin <= max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax) * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By separately calculating `abs_vmax` and `abs_vmin` and using them in the subsequent computations, we avoid the overflow issues in the `nonsingular` function. This corrected version of the function should now handle large values without encountering overflow errors.
