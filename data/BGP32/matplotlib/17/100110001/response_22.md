### Analysis:
1. The `nonsingular` function handles modifying the endpoints of a given range to prevent singularities.
2. The error seems to be related to overflow encountered during scalar subtraction or taking the absolute value.
3. The failing test is trying to set the colormap limits and calls the `nonsingular` function, resulting in the runtime error.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug includes ensuring proper handling of large values during calculations to prevent overflow issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the calculation for checking small intervals to `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny` and handling large values properly, the corrected version of the function should resolve the overflow issues and pass the failing test.
