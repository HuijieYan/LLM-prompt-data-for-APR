### Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is responsible for modifying endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failure originates from the function encountering an overflow issue during calculation, leading to a RuntimeWarning.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation involving `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` can lead to overflow.
2. The comparison `vmax - vmin` can also result in overflow and may be influenced by the previous calculation.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the use of `abs` function on `vmin` and `vmax`, potentially leading to overflow. The subsequent comparison `vmax - vmin` can also cause an overflow issue. These calculations trigger the RuntimeWarning messages and affect the correct behavior of the function.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To address the bug and avoid overflow, it is essential to adjust the calculations of `maxabsvalue` and the comparison of `vmax - vmin`. Ensuring the calculations do not result in overflow will prevent the RuntimeWarning messages.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing the bug and its causes, here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Adding an additional check to avoid potential overflow
    if maxabsvalue * tiny < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax) - abs(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version includes adjustments in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the comparison `vmax - vmin` to prevent overflow issues and resolve the bug.
