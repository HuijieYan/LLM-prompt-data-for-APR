### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. The failing tests provide input values for the function and expect specific outputs. However, the bugs occur due to potential overflow issues or incorrect calculations in the `nonsingular` function, resulting in RuntimeWarnings during the test execution.

#### Bugs Identified:
1. Overflow encountered in scalar subtract during the runtime for some test cases.
2. RuntimeWarning for overflow occurred in scalar absolute due to incorrect calculations.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `nonsingular` function, we need to adjust the calculations to avoid overflow issues and ensure correct handling of the input ranges. Specifically, the comparison logic and threshold calculations need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to prevent the warnings.

### Corrected Code
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Explanation
- In the corrected code, the comparison `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` has been simplified to check whether `maxabsvalue < tiny` to avoid potential overflow when comparing very small values.
- Adjusted the logic inside the `elif` block to handle the interval expansion correctly without causing overflow or RuntimeWarnings.
- The corrected code should now handle the input values correctly and return the expected results, passing the failing test cases.
