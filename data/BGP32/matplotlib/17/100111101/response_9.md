### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to arithmetic calculations leading to an overflow or a RuntimeWarning involving scalar operations. This issue arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too small, and the computation of `maxabsvalue` is causing an overflow. In such cases, the calculations for adjusting the `vmin` and `vmax` values are incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` values in cases where there is potential for an overflow. Additionally, we need to handle the arithmetic operations more carefully to avoid RuntimeWarnings.

### The Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:  # Check for very small intervals
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*np.abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Conclusion
The corrected function now handles small intervals properly and avoids the overflow issue. This revised logic ensures that the adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` are done accurately based on the specified conditions.
