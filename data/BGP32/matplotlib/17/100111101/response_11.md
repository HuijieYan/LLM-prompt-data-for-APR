### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the implementation of the `nonsingular` function failing to handle certain input scenarios correctly. Specifically, the code is encountering warnings related to overflow when dealing with values close to the limits of representable numbers due to incorrect calculations within the function.

1. In Case 1, the function performs a comparison between `vmax - vmin` and a value based on `maxabsvalue * tiny`, causing an overflow warning due to the subtraction operation.

2. In Case 2, the function handles the scenario of `vmax < vmin` but fails to adequately adjust the endpoints.

3. In Case 3, the function correctly swaps vmin and vmax if vmin > vmax, but later when calculating `maxabsvalue`, it uses the original values of vmin and vmax, leading to incorrect calculations.

4. In Case 4, with infinite input values, the function does not handle these cases correctly, resulting in a failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address these issues and correct the `nonsingular` function, the following improvements can be made:
1. Ensure that calculations involving vmin and vmax do not lead to overflows by checking for such scenarios.
2. Adjust the handling of vmin and vmax swapping to cover all cases correctly.
3. Update the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to consider the correct values based on the handled cases.
4. Properly account for infinite input values and adjust the logic to handle them appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the above corrections, the `nonsingular` function should now handle a wider range of scenarios correctly and avoid the issues that were causing the failing tests.
