Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to stem from incorrect handling of edge cases. Specifically, the function should properly account for the numerical limits when checking for singularities and modifying endpoints accordingly.

To address this issue, we need to adjust the transformations within the function to handle cases where the input values approach the numerical precision limits. Here is the fixed version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    interval_size = max(1e-20, vmax - vmin)  # Account for very small intervals
    
    if interval_size < tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < 1e-6 or abs(vmin) < 1e-6:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised implementation aims to correct the issues related to handling very small intervals and approaching numerical precision limits. It ensures that the function can accurately modify the endpoints to avoid singularities within a reasonable range.

By incorporating these modifications, the `nonsingular` function should be able to pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for the given inputs.
