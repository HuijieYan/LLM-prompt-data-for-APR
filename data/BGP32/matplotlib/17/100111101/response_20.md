### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculations involving `tiny` and `maxabsvalue`. The error messages indicate issues with overflow and absolute value computation. The bug is especially prominent when dealing with values close to the precision limits of floating-point numbers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to handle extreme cases where floating-point operations may lead to overflow or incorrect results. Specifically, we need to adjust how we calculate `maxabsvalue` and how we handle scenarios where the interval is too small.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    diff = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if diff <= (maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= (expander * maxabsvalue + expander if vmax >= 0 else -expander)
            vmax += (expander * maxabsvalue + expander if vmin <= 0 else -expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

### Correction Rationale
1. Calculating the interval difference `diff` before `maxabsvalue` computation helps avoid problematic scenarios.
2. Adjusted the interval expansion logic to consider the sign of `vmin` and `vmax` separately to prevent issues with very small intervals.
3. Updated the correction to handle swapping based on the `increasing` flag correctly.

By making these adjustments, the corrected `nonsingular` function should now handle the cases where the original implementation produced errors due to floating-point precision limits.
