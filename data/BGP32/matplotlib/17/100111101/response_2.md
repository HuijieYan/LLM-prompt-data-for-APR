### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the comparison between `vmax` and `vmin`, and the subsequent calculations depending on their relationship. The issue occurs when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` becomes very small, close to or smaller than `tiny`, leading to potential overflow or invalid operations due to precision.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small. This can be achieved by handling the cases where the interval is too small and the calculations may lead to overflow or invalid operations.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            # Adjust vmin and vmax to avoid small interval issues
            delta = expander * maxabsvalue * tiny
            vmin -= delta / 2
            vmax += delta / 2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

By adjusting the values of `vmin` and `vmax` proportionally when the interval becomes too small, we can prevent potential overflow or precision issues and ensure the correct behavior of the `nonsingular` function.
