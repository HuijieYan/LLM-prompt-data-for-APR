The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by a possible overflow error when subtracting `vmax` and `vmin`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the subtraction operation between `vmax` and `vmin` does not cause an overflow. One approach to resolve this is to check for the absolute difference before performing the subtraction operation to prevent the overflow.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    abs_diff = abs(vmax - vmin)
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs_diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should address the overflow issue encountered in the failing tests. It adds a check for the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` before performing the subtraction to prevent the overflow error.

Please replace the buggy function with this corrected version to ensure the failing tests pass successfully.
