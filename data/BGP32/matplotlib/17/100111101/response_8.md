### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than the product of the maximum absolute value of both endpoints and `tiny`. This condition causes an overflow error due to a possible incorrect calculation under certain circumstances.

In the failing test, the input parameters (`vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, `increasing`) lead to a calculation where `max = 0 - (-32768) = 32768`, and since `32768 - (-32768) = 65536 > 32768 * 1e-15`, the condition in the buggy function is met causing an overflow error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation that may lead to overflow is properly handled. One approach could be to refactor the logic in the `elif` block to avoid the potential overflow. We can modify how the endpoints are expanded in this specific case to prevent the overflow error while still maintaining the intended behavior of the function.

### Updated and Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == vmin:
            vmax = vmax + max(expander, tiny)
        else:
            avg = (vmax + vmin) / 2
            distance = max(abs(vmax - vmin), 2*abs(avg))
            vmin = avg - distance/2
            vmax = avg + distance/2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By updating the logic in the `elif` block to adjust the endpoints based on their average and distance, we prevent the overflow error in cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than the product of the maximum absolute value and `tiny`. This corrected function should now handle the failing test scenarios without encountering overflow issues.
