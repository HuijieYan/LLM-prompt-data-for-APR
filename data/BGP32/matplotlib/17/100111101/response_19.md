### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the comparison and calculation of values within the `nonsingular` function. The error messages indicate overflow and invalid operations when the function tries to adjust the range values. Specifically, it seems that problems occur when dealing with small ranges or large values due to insufficient handling in the current implementation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:
1. Ensure proper comparison when expanding the range for small intervals.
2. Handle cases where the range values are large to prevent overflow.
3. Check and adjust the swapping logic based on the increasing flag.

### Bug Fix and Updated Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Handle infinite values
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) if vmin >= 0 else -expander
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) if vmax >= 0 else -expander
    
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the `nonsingular` function as shown above, we address the issues related to comparison, handling large values, and swapping logic. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected results.
