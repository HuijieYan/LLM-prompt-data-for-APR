The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be in the handling of absolute values and comparisons, leading to potential overflow issues causing RuntimeWarnings. To address this, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle absolute values without encountering overflow errors. 

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version aims to handle cases where values might lead to overflow by adjusting the operations on `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, it considers the `increasing` parameter to correctly swap the values when needed.

Please test this updated function with the failing test cases to ensure it now produces the expected results without any RuntimeWarnings. Make sure to handle any additional errors that may arise during testing.
