### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` when the `vmin` and `vmax` values are very large. The code calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum of the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, which can lead to an overflow issue when the difference between the values is small.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to avoid the overflow issue. One way to do this is to calculate `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value divided by `tiny` to prevent the overflow condition.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) / tiny

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value divided by `tiny` to avoid the overflow issue. This correction should make the function work correctly and pass the failing tests.
