### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `nonsingular` is not handling large absolute values correctly, leading to overflow issues which trigger warnings due to the finite precision of floating-point numbers.

1. In Case 1, the `maxabsvalue` should be 1, but it is incorrectly calculated as an integer, resulting in the wrong value.
2. In Case 2, `maxabsvalue` is calculated correctly but as a float, it should be an integer.
3. In Case 3, there is a variable swap occurring due to `vmax < vmin`, but the logic to handle this swap is incorrect.
4. The handling of infinity and large numbers are causing errors in Cases 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `maxabsvalue` is correctly calculated as an integer. Additionally, we should handle special cases like infinity and very large numbers appropriately to avoid overflow issues.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = int(max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)))  # Ensure maxabsvalue is an integer

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By making sure `maxabsvalue` is cast to an integer and handling edge cases properly, the corrected function will now handle the mentioned cases correctly without triggering overflow issues.
