## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `nonsingular` is caused by a potential overflow error in cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is calculated and stored as `maxabsvalue`. This can lead to overflow issues in certain scenarios, as seen in the failing tests. When the difference exceeds the limits of the data types being used, it results in runtime warnings about overflow.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the calculation of `maxabsvalue` in a way that avoids potential overflow issues. One way to address this would be to modify the calculation to ensure that overflow does not occur by using appropriate data types or by transforming the calculation to avoid arithmetic operations that could cause overflow. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly for all possible input cases.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Handle potential overflow issues by incorporating safer calculation methods
    absdiff = np.abs(vmax - vmin)
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif absdiff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using the absolute difference calculation in a way that is safer for potential overflow situations, the corrected function should handle the cases without raising overflow errors and provide the expected output values, ensuring correctness and stability for the given scenarios.
