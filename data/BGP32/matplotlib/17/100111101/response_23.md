## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from how the program handles calculating the `maxabsvalue` variable when the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are near the limits of integer representation. In particular, there are overflow issues occurring because the function compares the calculated `maxabsvalue` to a threshold value based on floating-point precision.

In Case 2, the `maxabsvalue` calculation results in a float value of `1.5`, but the comparison `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` causes a comparison issue leading to a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculations within the `nonsingular` function do not encounter overflow issues related to integer representation. Specifically, we need to handle the `maxabsvalue` calculation and comparison with the threshold carefully to avoid any compatibility issues with integer data types.

## Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the issue described above:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code ensures that the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` will not overflow due to integer values. Additionally, explicit type casting to float is done where necessary to prevent any compatibility issues stemming from mixed data types.
