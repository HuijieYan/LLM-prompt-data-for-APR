### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to potential overflows and underflows due to the manipulation of `float` values. The bug is triggered when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, leading to floating-point precision issues.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the issue is with the assignment of integer values to `vmin` and `vmax`, which later become floating-point numbers. When the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is close to zero, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` triggers potential overflow/underflow, leading to a precision error.
2. In Case 2, even though the input values are in floating-point format, the similar overflow issue arises due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers.
3. In Case 3, the `swapped` variable is correctly set when `vmax < vmin`, but it is not considered when checking the condition leading to the error.
4. In Case 4, there is an issue with the handling of `-inf` and `inf` values as input.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Convert all input parameters to floating-point values.
2. Improve the check for swapping values if `vmin > vmax`.
3. Adjust the conditions to prevent precision errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By implementing these corrections, the `nonsingular` function should now handle the input parameters appropriately without triggering any precision errors.
