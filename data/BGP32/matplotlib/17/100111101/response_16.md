## Bug Analysis

### Issue
The bug occurs in the `nonsingular` function when handling cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` can lead to an overflow situation when the values of `vmin`, `vmax`, `maxabsvalue`, and `tiny` are large numbers.

### Cause
1. In Case 2, when `vmin = -0.5` and `vmax = 1.5`, the calculated `maxabsvalue` is `1.5`, which can lead to overflow.
2. In Case 3, for values where `vmax` ends up being less than `vmin` after swapping, the `maxabsvalue` can become negative leading to incorrect calculations.
3. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` can result in an overflow error when handling very large numbers, as seen in the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that we handle cases where large values are involved to prevent overflow errors. One way to address this is to calculate the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` directly rather than relying on the `maxabsvalue` in the problematic condition.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff <= tiny:
        if not (vmax or vmin):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By directly calculating the `diff` as `vmax - vmin` and avoiding the use of `maxabsvalue` in the problematic condition, we prevent the possibility of overflow issues when dealing with large numbers.
