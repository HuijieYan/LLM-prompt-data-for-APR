### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `nonsingular` occurs in the condition where it checks if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small based on the `tiny` value. The calculation for this check is faulty, leading to incorrect adjustments to the endpoints if the condition is met. This results in the function returning incorrect values in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition that determines whether the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` needs expanding. By accurately assessing the interval size based on the `tiny` value and the maximum absolute value of the endpoints, we can make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the function returns the correct endpoints.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function properly handles the adjustment of endpoints based on the interval size between `vmin` and `vmax`, ensuring that the function returns the correct values as expected in all cases.
