### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are several issues present in the function that lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the interval is too small.

1. The check for input that is either infinite or not finite should return the pair `-expander`, `expander` immediately if found. Instead, it currently returns without taking into account the input values.
2. There is a logical error when handling small intervals. The calculation `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` has a misplaced comparison operator that should likely be `<=` instead of `<`.
3. The calculation to expand small intervals by adding `expander` to both endpoints is not consistent across all conditions. It should always expand the endpoints by a consistent amount based on `expander`.

### Bug Fix
To address the issues identified, we need to make the following changes:
1. Update the check for infinite or not finite inputs to return `-expander`, `expander` correctly.
2. Modify the comparison in the condition for expanding small intervals to `<=`.
3. Adjust the logic for expanding small intervals to ensure it's consistent across all conditions.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander

    if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle various scenarios to avoid singularities and return the expected results.
