The bug in the function `nonsingular` arises from incorrect handling of input values that are close to zero. Specifically, when both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero, the current logic doesn't expand the interval properly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for expanding the interval when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. We should consider the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` when expanding, rather than their signs. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now properly expand the interval when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero, ensuring that the expected behavior is met for all the provided test cases.
