### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the condition where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is compared to a threshold calculated based on the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. The bug is manifested when the interval is small and the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is triggered to expand the interval. This condition doesn't account for negative values properly, leading to incorrect expansions and swaps.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that handles the expansion of the interval when it is small. By considering both positive and negative values correctly, we can ensure that the interval is expanded appropriately while maintaining the correct relationship between `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax and increasing:  # Check increasing condition
        swapped = True
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny or vmax - vmin < tiny:  # Adjust expansion condition
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if vmin >= 0:
                vmin -= expander
                vmax += expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version of the function ensures proper handling of negative values and maintains the correct relationship between the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`.
