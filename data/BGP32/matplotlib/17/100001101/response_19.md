### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the condition where `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This condition incorrectly expands the interval when it should not be expanded. This leads to incorrect results in some cases where the interval should not be modified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition that determines whether to expand the interval needs to be corrected. The condition should only expand the interval when it is too small based on the `tiny` threshold, not based on the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

### Corrected Version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval < tiny:
        midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2
        vmin = midpoint - expander
        vmax = midpoint + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version maintains the interval expansion based on the `tiny` threshold only, ensuring that the interval is only modified when needed and not based on the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.
