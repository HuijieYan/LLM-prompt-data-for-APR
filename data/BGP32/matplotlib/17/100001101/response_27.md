## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `nonsingular` is caused by the incorrect update of the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` when the interval is considered too small or close to zero. The logic for expanding the interval or updating the values is not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect values being returned, violating the expectations in some cases, like the ones provided.

The bug arises when trying to adjust the endpoints based on the interval size and the value of the endpoints. When both values are close to zero, the logic incorrectly sets both endpoints to be equal to `expander`, instead of adjusting them based on their respective absolute values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the adjustment logic for the endpoints when the interval is considered too small or close to zero. We should correctly handle the scenario where both endpoints are close to zero so that they are expanded based on their absolute values. Additionally, we need to ensure correct handling of cases where one endpoint is zero and the other is not, preventing situations where both endpoints become equal.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif vmax == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        elif vmin == 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with updating the endpoints based on absolute values and handles the scenario where one endpoint is zero while the other is not. It ensures that the adjusted endpoints maintain the correct magnitude relation and swapping when necessary.
