### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `nonsingular` function is primarily due to incorrect logic when checking for small intervals and adjusting the endpoints accordingly. The algorithm mistakenly alters the `vmin` and `vmax` values without considering the original relationship between them in certain cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. Maintain the relative relationship between `vmin` and `vmax` when expanding the interval.
2. Take care of the special cases properly, such as when both inputs are 0 or very close to 0.
3. Ensure that the endpoints are handled correctly when one or both inputs are `inf` or `NaN`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if interval_size < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function addresses the issues identified in the buggy function. It correctly handles the relative relationship between `vmin` and `vmax`, ensures correct adjustments for small intervals while respecting the original values, and handles special cases appropriately.
