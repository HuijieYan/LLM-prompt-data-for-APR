The buggy function `nonsingular` has a logic error in the calculation of the expanded endpoints when the interval is too small. The issue arises when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is checked but the subsequent calculation to expand the interval is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
In Case 3, the inputs are vmin = 0.5, vmax = -0.5, which means the interval size is 1.0, and maxabsvalue is 0.5. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is True since 0.5 - (-0.5) = 1 is less than 0.5 * 1e-15. However, due to the negative interval, the intention should be to expand and make vmin = -expander and vmax = expander, yet the current logic doesn't cater to this correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the logic under the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to correctly adjust the endpoints when the interval is too small. We should directly set `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander` in this case to cover both positive and negative interval scenarios.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly handle cases where the interval is too small and expand the endpoints to avoid singularities as intended.
