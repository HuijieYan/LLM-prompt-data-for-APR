### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is evaluated incorrectly. The issue arises from the comparison between `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with values close to zero due to floating-point precision errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should consider a different approach to handle the check for the interval size. One possible solution is to compare the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with a threshold based on `tiny`, rather than comparing the difference directly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    diff = vmax - vmin
    if abs(diff) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmax)  # Corrected from abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function addresses the bug by comparing the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with a threshold based on `tiny` to determine if the interval size is too small.
