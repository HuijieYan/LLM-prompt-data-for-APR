The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function encounters a bug where it does not correctly handle cases where both inputs are very close to zero or where the inputs are swapped (based on the `increasing` parameter) but have values exceeding the specified thresholds. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is smaller than the threshold defined by `tiny`. In these cases, we need to properly expand the interval while considering the values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        swapped = True
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        swapped = False

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            diff = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= diff
            vmax += diff

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function has been updated to properly handle the cases where the endpoints need to be expanded based on the threshold defined by `tiny`. It also correctly swaps the endpoints back if `increasing` is set to False and the inputs were initially swapped.
