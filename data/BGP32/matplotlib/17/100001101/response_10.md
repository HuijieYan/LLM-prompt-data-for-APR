### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is due to the incorrect comparison in the condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The intention seems to be to detect a range that is too small and needs to be expanded, but the comparison is currently flawed. The buggy condition does not consider negative values properly and can result in incorrect expansions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to correctly handle negative values. We should also ensure that the condition adequately detects when the interval is too small and requires expansion.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin <= abs(vmax) * tiny) or (vmax - vmin <= abs(vmin) * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function now properly handles negative values in the condition checking the size of the range that needs potential expansion. This fix ensures that the function behaves as intended for all input scenarios provided.
