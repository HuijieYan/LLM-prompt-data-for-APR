The bug in the provided `nonsingular` function lies in the condition where it checks if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold `tiny`. The bug causes incorrect adjustments to be made to the endpoints in certain cases, leading to unexpected outcomes.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 1, the function should expand the interval as it is smaller than the threshold `tiny`. However, the calculation inside the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not yield the correct result, causing the function to return incorrect values.
- In Case 2, even though the interval is correct, the calculation inside the aforementioned condition results in misleading adjustments.
- In Case 3, the swapping logic is causing the function to return wrong values.
- In Case 4, the function doesn't handle infinite values correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where the interval size is checked against the threshold `tiny`. It requires a new approach to correctly determine when to expand the interval.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

Now, with the corrected function, all the provided cases should return the expected values.
