### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the conditional statement that checks if the interval is smaller than `tiny`. When `maxabsvalue` is calculated as the maximum value between `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`, it only considers the absolute values of the endpoints separately, which leads to incorrect comparisons in some scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to calculate the correct `maxabsvalue` that considers both `vmin` and `vmax` when determining the interval size. Additionally, we should adjust the conditional statements for handling small intervals appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin
    
    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue or maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander
    elif interval <= tiny * maxabsvalue:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected code includes a calculation of `interval` to properly check if the interval is too small and adjusts the range accordingly. This ensures that the function behaves as expected for all input scenarios.
