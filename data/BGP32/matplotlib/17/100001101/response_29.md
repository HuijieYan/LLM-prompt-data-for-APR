### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when handling cases where both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to 0. In such cases, the function incorrectly expands the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` instead of returning them as they are (`-expander, expander`). This behavior violates the expected output for those specific cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition that checks if both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to 0 to return the correct values (`-expander, expander`).
2. Ensure that all other conditions and calculations remain accurate to meet the expected output for different scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles scenarios where both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to 0 by returning `-expander, expander` as expected. This fix ensures that the function behaves appropriately for all input cases.
