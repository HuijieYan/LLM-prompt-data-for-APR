## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from incorrect logic when handling cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities and expand the range if the original interval is too small. However, the check for small intervals and subsequent expansion is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to address the issues related to identifying and expanding small intervals. Specifically, we should correctly handle cases where `vmax - vmin` is small compared to the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, we need to ensure the conditions related to `vmin` and `vmax` being very close to zero are properly handled to avoid inconsistencies.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        if increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        else:
            vmin, vmax = vmax - expander, vmin + expander
    else:
        interval = vmax - vmin
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if interval <= tiny * maxabsvalue:
            if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function handles the small interval expansion logic correctly, taking into account the conditions where `vmax - vmin` is small compared to the maximum absolute value. It also considers the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero. The correct swapping logic based on the `increasing` parameter is implemented as well.
