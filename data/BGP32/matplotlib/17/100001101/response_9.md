The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to how it handles cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to each other or both very small/negative. The function is supposed to expand the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` if these conditions are met, but the current implementation is incorrectly handling these cases. Additionally, there are issues with the logic of swapping `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, we need to address the cases where vmin and vmax are close to each other or very small/negative. We should update the logic to expand the interval correctly in these scenarios and also properly handle the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` flag.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    max_range = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = abs(vmax - vmin)
    
    if interval < max_range * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the original code and should now correctly handle the cases where vmin and vmax are very close to each other or small/negative. It also correctly handles the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` flag.
