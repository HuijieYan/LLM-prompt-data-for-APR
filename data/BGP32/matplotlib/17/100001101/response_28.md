### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small, which leads to incorrect adjustments of the endpoints. The conditions within the function are not properly handling cases where the interval is close to zero or extremely small compared to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. This results in incorrect adjustments and potential errors in the returned values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling cases where the interval is too small. We should ensure that the adjustments made to `vmin` and `vmax` are appropriate for different scenarios, including when the interval is close to zero.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function adjusts the logic to properly handle cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small. It ensures that the adjustments made to the endpoints are appropriate depending on the situation. The function now correctly handles scenarios where the interval is close to zero or when adjustments are required.
