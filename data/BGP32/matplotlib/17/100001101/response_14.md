### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, where `maxabsvalue` represents the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. In the buggy condition, there is a potential issue with the comparison between `maxabsvalue` and the threshold. It seems that the comparison is not correctly formulated, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect modifications of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the problematic condition where `maxabsvalue` is compared. We should update the comparison to ensure that the condition accurately reflects the intended logic to expand the interval if it is too small. By adjusting this condition, we can align the behavior of the function with the expected output for the given input cases.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By correcting the comparison condition and ensuring the correct assignment of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the input parameters, this updated function should now provide the expected output for the given test cases.
