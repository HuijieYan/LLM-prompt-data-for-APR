Based on the error messages and the runtime input/output values, the issue seems to be related to potential overflows when trying to calculate the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`, and when taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the calculations do not result in overflow errors. One way to do this is by converting the input values to float before performing any mathematical operations to avoid integer overflow and underflow.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)  # Convert to float to avoid overflow/underflow
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This updated function ensures that the input values are converted to float before any calculations are performed, mitigating potential overflow issues that may arise when dealing with integer values.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases provided to ensure it works as expected.
