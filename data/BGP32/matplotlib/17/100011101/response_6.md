### Bug Explanation
The issue arises from potential overflow and underflow encountered in the calculations inside the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, the operations involving `abs` and comparisons with a very small value `tiny` can lead to unexpected results if the values are too large or too close to each other, causing the overflow and underflow issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we should handle the special cases of extremely large values and very small intervals more carefully. By adjusting the conditions and calculations, we can prevent the overflow and underflow problems that are causing the runtime warnings.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the overflow and underflow issues when dealing with large values or small intervals. It adjusts the conditions to properly handle these cases, ensuring that the function operates correctly without encountering runtime warnings.
