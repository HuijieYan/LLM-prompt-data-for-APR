### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug arises when the function encounters a scenario where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, causing potential overflow issues.
2. The error message indicates overflow in scalar operations while subtracting values.
3. The bug is due to a check that uses `maxabsvalue` to conditionally adjust `vmin` and `vmax`, not accounting for the possibility of overflow.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional statements inside the function to handle scenarios where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small more carefully.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    delta = maxabsvalue * tiny

    if vmax - vmin <= delta:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= delta/2
            vmax += delta/2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By calculating `delta` to represent the very small difference between `vmin` and `vmax` correctly and updating the adjustment mechanism based on this value, we ensure that the function can handle such scenarios without causing overflow.
