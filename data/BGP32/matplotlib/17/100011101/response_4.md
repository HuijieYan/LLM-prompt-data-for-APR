## Analysis
The bug seems to be causing overflow warnings due to the subtraction operation in the buggy function, which could lead to incorrect results or an exception in certain cases. Specifically, in the cases where `maxabsvalue * tiny` is close to the range of representable values.

The function is designed to handle the endpoints of a range and avoid singularities by modifying them if needed. The issue arises when the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very tiny, triggering the `elif` condition causing the overflow warnings.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the edge cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is very small appropriately. We can modify the conditions to prevent potential overflows and provide correct results without triggering warnings.

## Code Fix
Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    compare_value = (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny
    
    if maxabsvalue < compare_value:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander
            vmax = vmax + expander
            
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This modified version includes proper handling for small intervals between `vmin` and `vmax`, ensuring correct results and avoiding potential overflows.
