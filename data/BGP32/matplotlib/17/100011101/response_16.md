### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the conditional block where it checks if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This calculation can lead to overflow issues when working with very large or very small values, as seen in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the calculation for determining if the range is too small and requires expansion. Instead of directly comparing `vmax - vmin` to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, we can compare the relative difference (ratio) of the range to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    interval_ratio = (vmax - vmin) / maxabsvalue  # Calculate ratio instead of direct difference
    if interval_ratio <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By updating the calculation of the interval ratio and comparing it to `tiny`, we avoid the potential overflow errors encountered in the original implementation. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values for each case.
