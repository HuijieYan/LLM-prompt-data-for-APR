The issue in the `nonsingular` function arises from how the function handles absolute values and comparisons near the extreme limits of floating-point numbers. The `RuntimeWarning` messages suggest there are issues with overflow in scalar operations due to extreme values being used during the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent comparison.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust how we calculate `maxabsvalue` and handle the comparison to avoid overflows.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Calculate the absolute values of vmin and vmax without overflow
    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)
    
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        # Adjust the values if the interval is too small
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Adjust the values based on expander
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version avoids extreme values causing overflow issues and ensures that the calculations are done without encountering runtime warnings related to overflow. By computing the absolute values separately and handling the adjustments appropriately, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing tests.
