### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of extreme values and calculations leading to overflows, resulting in `RuntimeWarning` messages during the tests. The function is designed to modify endpoints to avoid singularities, handle swapping based on `increasing` parameter, and expand the range if necessary.

1. In cases where `vmin` or `vmax` is `inf`, the function correctly returns `-expander`, `expander` to handle infinite values. 
2. However, problems arise when dealing with extreme values close to zero or differences between `vmax` and `vmin` being very small.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Introduce checks for extreme values and avoid calculations causing potential overflows or unusual results.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles swapping of values.
3. Add appropriate comments and documentation for clarity.

### Corrected Code
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:  # Only swap if increasing=True
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin / maxabsvalue)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax / maxabsvalue)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making these adjustments in the code, it should handle extreme values and calculations more robustly, thus resolving the runtime warnings encountered during the failing tests.
