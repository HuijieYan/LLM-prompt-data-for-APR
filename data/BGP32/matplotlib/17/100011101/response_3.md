## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to potential errors in handling extreme values with the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, the function fails to consider cases where the input values are close to the limits of numerical precision, causing arithmetic overflow or incorrect absolute value calculations. This results in the function returning incorrect values, leading to the observed runtime warnings.

### Issue 1:
In the `nonsingular` function:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```
the `maxabsvalue` calculation is based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. When dealing with extreme values, this calculation might lead to issues such as overflow or incorrect results.

### Issue 2:
The conditional block:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
    if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
```
attempts to adjust the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` when the interval is too small. However, the subtraction of `expander * abs(vmin)` and addition of `expander * abs(vmax)` might lead to incorrect results, especially when dealing with extreme values.


## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issues related to potential arithmetic overflow and incorrect calculations when handling extreme input values. We can modify the logic to handle these cases more robustly to ensure correct behavior, especially when working with values close to numerical precision limits.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if interval < tiny or interval < expander * maxabsvalue:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin = min(vmin, -expander)
        vmax = max(vmax, expander)

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By using the `min` and `max` functions, we ensure that the values stay within the appropriate range, more robustly handle small intervals, and handle extreme cases better. This corrected function should provide the expected output for the given test cases.
