## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by potential arithmetic overflow in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. The `maxabsvalue` represents the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. When `vmin` and `vmax` are very large, taking the absolute value can lead to an overflow condition, resulting in incorrect values.

In the failing cases provided, the overflow is occurring when the function tries to calculate the maximum absolute value between `-32768` and `0`, which produces a signal to Python that the overflow is encountered in scalar arithmetic.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we should rewrite the logic to avoid arithmetic overflow when calculating the `maxabsvalue`. One common approach to overcome this issue is to rewrite the calculation based on the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` rather than taking the absolute value of each individually.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * (vmax - vmin)
            vmax += expander * (vmax - vmin)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the overflow issue by calculating the `diff` between `vmax` and `vmin` instead of taking the absolute value of each individually to determine the `maxabsvalue`. This revised logic ensures correct results without encountering overflow during arithmetic operations.
