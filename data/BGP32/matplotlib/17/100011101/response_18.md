### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from potential overflow issues when calculating absolute values or differences between `vmin` and `vmax`.

1. In Case 1, the variable `maxabsvalue` incorrectly remains as an `int` instead of a `float`, causing potential issues with calculations.
2. In Case 3, a swap operation is performed when `vmin` is greater than `vmax`, which results in incorrect behavior and potentially wrong calculations of `maxabsvalue`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the types of variables are correctly handled and prevent any potential overflow or data type issues during the calculations.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    maxabsvalue = float(maxabsvalue)  # Ensure maxabsvalue is of type float

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By ensuring that the `maxabsvalue` is transformed into a `float`, we address potential overflow issues and improve the accuracy of calculations in the function. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
