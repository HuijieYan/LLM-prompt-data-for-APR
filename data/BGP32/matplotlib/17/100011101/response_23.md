The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to potential overflow issues when dealing with large input values, as evident from the error messages mentioning overflow. The implementation compares the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with `maxabsvalue`, leading to errors caused by the comparison in the presence of large values.

To fix this bug, we can adjust the logic to handle these cases more robustly by changing the condition that leads to overflow problems.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    threshold = 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny
    
    if expander > threshold:
        raise ValueError("Expander value is too large. Please use a smaller value.")
    
    if maxabsvalue < threshold:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This updated implementation includes a check to prevent the expander value from being too large, which could cause issues with overflow. Additionally, the comparison threshold is calculated differently to avoid the potential overflow encountered in the faulty version of the function.

With these changes, the `nonsingular` function should now handle the cases correctly and avoid the overflow issues.
