## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to potential overflow errors encountered while performing arithmetic operations on integer inputs in a floating-point context. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to subtract two int16 values, which may result in overflow exceptions.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed in the correct data type to avoid overflow issues. In this case, we should convert the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` to floating-point numbers early in the function to handle the arithmetic correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that all comparisons and arithmetic operations are performed with floating-point numbers, avoiding any potential integer overflow issues.
