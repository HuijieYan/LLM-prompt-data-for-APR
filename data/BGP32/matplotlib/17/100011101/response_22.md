### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by potential overflows when calculating absolute values and performing arithmetic calculations near the limits of integer representation. This leads to runtime warnings about overflow and invalid calculations during execution.

In particular, the bugs can be attributed to:
1. Taking the absolute value of potentially large integer values in `maxabsvalue` without considering integer overflow.
2. Performing arithmetic operations on integer values that may exceed the representable range.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bugs, we need to ensure that the calculations within the function are safe and do not lead to overflow issues. By converting the input values to floating-point numbers early in the process, we can avoid the integer overflow problems and ensure correct handling of the singularity thresholds.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if type(vmin) is not float:
        vmin = float(vmin)
    if type(vmax) is not float:
        vmax = float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By converting the input values to floats early on in the function, we prevent potential overflows when dealing with large integers. This corrected version should handle the input data correctly and avoid the previously encountered runtime warnings and errors.
