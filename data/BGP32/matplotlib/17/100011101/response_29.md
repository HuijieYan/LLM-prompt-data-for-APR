## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the calculation involving `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny`. In some cases, this calculation can lead to an overflow due to the large numbers involved, resulting in a RuntimeWarning.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the portion of code where the calculation causing the overflow occurs. Specifically, we should handle cases where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` could lead to overflow.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

With this correction, the function now handles the arithmetic involving `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny` in a way that avoids potential overflow issues and correctly returns the endpoints.
