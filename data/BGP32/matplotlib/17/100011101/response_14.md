### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to handling extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax`. When `vmax` and `vmin` have very large absolute values or when their difference is very small, the function encounters overflow and absolute value calculation issues, leading to incorrect results and `RuntimeWarning` messages.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` can lead to `vmin` and `vmax` being assigned `-expander` and `expander`, respectively, which would not be appropriate for these cases.
2. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not handling cases where the difference is very small appropriately.

### Bug Cause
1. The comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` in the first condition might evaluate to a very large number, leading to erroneous assignments of `-expander` and `expander` if `maxabsvalue` is smaller.
2. In the second condition, the subtraction `vmax - vmin` can cause an overflow due to the extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the first condition to avoid assigning extreme values when `maxabsvalue` is large.
2. Address the overflow issue in the second condition by handling the calculation differently.

### Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < 1e-6 / tiny:
        vmin = -expander * (1 + np.abs(vmin))
        vmax = expander * (1 + np.abs(vmax))
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By making the adjustments as described above, the `nonsingular` function should now handle extreme values correctly and avoid the previous issues leading to `RuntimeWarning` messages.
