## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small, causing overflow or overflow-related warnings due to operations involving large numbers or extreme values.

### Case Analysis
1. In Case 1, the small integer inputs result in `maxabsvalue` being a small integer as well, leading to acceptable behavior without overflow concerns.
2. In Case 2, the float inputs cause `maxabsvalue` to be a float, still within acceptable limits.
3. In Case 3, the swap operation meets the requirements for handling singularity.
4. In Case 4, the infinite values bypass the initial check for finiteness.
5. In Case 5, the int16 values lead to issues due to small differences and large absolute values.
6. In Case 6, the float64 values also showcase the potential for overflow in certain scenarios.
7. In Case 7, int16 inputs further highlight issues with absolute values and small differences.
8. In Case 8, float64 inputs demonstrate trouble with large absolute values and tiny differences due to float precision.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug and potential overflow issues, consider adjusting the conditionals and calculations that involve `vmin` and `vmax` to handle extreme situations more gracefully.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

## Conclusion
The bug in the `nonsingular` function was related to handling extreme values causing overflow. The bug fix included adjusting operations to consider sign information and magnitude appropriately, avoiding overflow-related issues.
