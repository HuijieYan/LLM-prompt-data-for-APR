### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises due to potential overflow issues when working with small intervals or very large values. The error messages suggest that overflow is being encountered when performing arithmetic operations on the input parameters. Specifically, overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute function.

#### Error Scenarios
- In Case 2, `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` is causing an overflow in the calculation which is not acceptable and leading to the error at the point `maxabsvalue * tiny`.
- In Case 3, when `vmin` is greater than `vmax`, swapping them results in negative values causing a discrepancy in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`.
- In Case 5 and Case 7, the provided input values being close to the limits for int16 are also causing issues due to the arithmetic performed during the transformation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to handle potential overflow issues that might arise due to large values or small intervals. We should modify the calculations ensuring they are within a safe numerical range and avoid any potential errors related to overflow.

### Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    interval = vmax - vmin
    if abs(interval) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expand_by = expander * abs(maxabsvalue)
            vmin -= expand_by
            vmax += expand_by

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version handles potential overflow scenarios and ensures the calculations are within acceptable numerical ranges, preventing the runtime errors encountered in the failing test cases.
