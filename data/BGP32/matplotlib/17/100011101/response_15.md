### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to potential overflow errors when taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, as well as during subtraction operations which may lead to overflow.

1. In Case 1, the maxabsvalue is calculated based on integers (1.0 for both `vmin` and `vmax`) which may result in incorrect calculations.
   
2. In Cases 2 and 3, the abs function applied to float values (`vmin` and `vmax`) could lead to overflow issues.

3. In Cases 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, there is a risk of overflow occurring when the abs function is applied to large numbers like `-20000.0` and `20000.0` or `-32768.0` and `0.0`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug and prevent overflow issues, we should ensure that calculations involving absolute values or subtractions are done with appropriate handling for numerical stability.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the mentioned issues:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.abs(vmin) == np.abs(vmax) == 0 or np.isclose(vmin, 0, abs_tol=tiny) and np.isclose(vmax, 0, abs_tol=tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    bounded_tiny = max(tiny, np.finfo(float).tiny)
    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / bounded_tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * bounded_tiny:
        vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version uses `np.abs` to handle absolute values which will prevent overflow issues and correct the calculation errors.

By applying these changes, the function should now handle the input values correctly and avoid the runtime warnings and errors observed in the failing tests.
