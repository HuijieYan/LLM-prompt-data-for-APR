### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by potential overflow issues due to using the `abs()` function in the `maxabsvalue` calculation. When applying `abs()` to the minimum and maximum values, they can exceed the maximum range that can be represented, leading to overflow errors as shown in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should handle potential overflow cases when calculating the `maxabsvalue`. One approach to mitigate this issue is by checking whether the values are close to their extremes before taking the absolute value.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if (abs(vmax) < 1e15) and (abs(vmin) < 1e15):
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    else:
        # Handles overflow cases
        maxabsvalue = 1e15

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

After fixing the bug, the function now includes a check to handle potential overflow cases when calculating `maxabsvalue` to avoid the overflow encountered issues seen in the failing tests.
