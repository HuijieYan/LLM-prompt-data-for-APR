### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to potential overflow issues when calculating absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. The error messages indicate that there are "overflow encountered" and "RuntimeWarning" issues when performing calculations that involve these values.

1. The first error message points to an overflow encountered when subtracting `vmax - vmin`.
2. The second error message highlights a RuntimeWarning when calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The function is designed to modify endpoints to avoid singularities by expanding the range if necessary and handling special cases such as infinities or NaN values. However, the calculations related to the absolute values and differences of `vmin` and `vmax` are not handling extreme values well, leading to potential overflow and warning issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, we need to revise the calculations that involve the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. By handling extreme values properly, we can avoid overflow issues and RuntimeWarnings. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the special cases mentioned in the documentation.

### Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if np.isclose(vmax, vmin) or np.isclose(maxabsvalue, 0.0):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version should handle extreme values, avoid overflows, and properly manage special cases like infinities and NaN values.
