## Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function has parameters `vmin` and `vmax`, and it expands or swaps them based on certain conditions.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `(not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax))` where the function returns values `-expander, expander` might behave undesirably.
2. The condition `vmax < vmin` where the values are swapped could potentially lead to issues.
3. The calculation for maxabsvalue and the subsequent conditions of expanding the range could be problematic.
4. The logic for swapping values might not work correctly based on the input variables and the `increasing` flag.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of inf, NaN, or very small values in the initial `if` condition. The swapping logic and the expansion logic may not cover all scenarios appropriately. Also, the logic for applying the `increasing` flag is error-prone.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the handling of inf, NaN, and very small values is correct.
2. Double-check the swapping logic and make sure that it covers all cases.
3. Verify the expansion conditions to accurately adjust the endpoints.
4. Review the `increasing` flag logic and ensure it swaps values appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with handling infinite or NaN values, swapping logic, endpoint expansion, and the behavior related to the `increasing` flag.
