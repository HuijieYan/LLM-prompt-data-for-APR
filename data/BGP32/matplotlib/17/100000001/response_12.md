### Analysis:
The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding them if they are too small. The function also handles cases where the endpoints are infinite or NaN, or both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is expected to check if the interval is very small. However, the computation may not be accurate due to the division by `tiny`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The calculation `vmin - expander * abs(vmin)` and `vmax + expander * abs(vmax)` to expand the interval might not handle negative values correctly.
3. The swapping logic when `vmin > vmax` is not correctly controlled by the `increasing` flag.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The computation `(1e6 / tiny)` in the condition for checking the interval size against the resolution limit may lead to inaccuracies and incorrect expansions.
2. The logic for expanding the interval based on the absolute value may produce unexpected results for negative values.
3. The swapping logic when `vmin > vmax` is not correctly controlled by the `increasing` flag, potentially leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more robust check to determine if the interval is too small based on a different approach.
2. Ensure the correct handling of negative values when expanding the interval.
3. Implement a proper control flow for swapping the endpoints based on the `increasing` flag.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        if increasing:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    if interval < tiny:
        vmin = vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version:
- I removed the unreliable comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and instead directly compare the interval size with `tiny`.
- I modified the calculation of expanding the interval to handle negative values properly and ensure that the interval is expanded symmetrically.
- I simplified the swapping logic to take into account the `increasing` flag while maintaining the correct order of endpoints.
