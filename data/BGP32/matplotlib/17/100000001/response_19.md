The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of `maxabsvalue` with the threshold `1e6 / tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny`. The comparison should be made between the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints and the `tiny` threshold.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version:
- The calculation of the interval is done as `interval = vmax - vmin` to correctly compare it to the `tiny * maxabsvalue`.
- The comparison is now between the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints and the `tiny` threshold, which fixes the bug.

This fix ensures that the function correctly modifies the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities as intended.
