The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition where it checks if `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition does not handle the case when `vmax` and `vmin` are negative. Due to the way the condition is structured, it leads to incorrect expansion of the range when both `vmax` and `vmin` are negative.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` instead of just their difference without considering the sign.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we replaced `vmax - vmin` with `abs(vmax - vmin)` in the condition where we check if the interval is smaller than `tiny`, ensuring that we consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.
