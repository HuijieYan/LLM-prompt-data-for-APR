The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when checking the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This condition is problematic because it doesn't appropriately handle cases where `maxabsvalue` is very close to zero but not necessarily zero. This can lead to incorrect expansion of the interval, especially when dealing with very small numbers.

To fix this bug, a better strategy would be to check the condition based on the ratio of the interval size to the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`). By comparing the interval size to the tolerance (`tiny`), we can ensure correct handling of cases where the interval is too small.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    interval_size = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval_size < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the `interval_size` as `vmax - vmin` and compare it directly to `tiny * maxabsvalue` to determine if the interval is too small. This approach ensures that the condition accounts for cases where the interval size is small relative to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.
