The potential error locations in the buggy function are:

1. The condition for checking if the interval is too small (`vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`) might not be correct. 
2. The calculation of `maxabsvalue` could be problematic.
3. The logic for dealing with cases where `vmax = 0` and `vmin = 0` might not work as intended.

Explanation of the bug:
- The bug in this function occurs when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not correctly handle the edge cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are very close to zero.
- If `vmax` and`vmin` are both close to zero, the condition is met, leading to the modification of `vmax` and `vmin` to `-expander` and `expander` which might not be desirable.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Improving the condition checking for small intervals and the calculation of `maxabsvalue` can help correct this bug.
- An additional check may be needed to handle cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are close to zero or zero with different signs.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            if abs(vmax) < abs(vmin):
                vmax = expander
                vmin = -expander
            else:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, the condition for a small interval has been modified to directly compare `maxabsvalue` to `tiny`. Additionally, a more explicit check has been added to properly handle cases where both `vmax` and `vmin` are close to zero or zero with different signs.
