The bug in the provided `nonsingular` function is related to the condition under which the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` are expanded. The issue arises when `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the maximum of `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`, and it is compared against a threshold `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, followed by an expansion of the endpoints.

The bug occurs because `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the maximum between `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`, which might result in the incorrect threshold comparison when both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative. This leads to incorrect expansion of the interval even though it might not be necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to calculate `maxabsvalue` correctly based on the absolute values of both `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, we should ensure that the condition for expansion of the interval is valid for both positive and negative values.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we calculate `abs_vmin` and `abs_vmax` separately to ensure the correct threshold comparison is made for both positive and negative values. This fix should address the buggy behavior of the original function.
