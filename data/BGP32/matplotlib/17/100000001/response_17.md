The buggy function `nonsingular` has a bug in the logic where it checks if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded. The bug is in the condition where it compares `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. The issue is that `np.finfo(float).tiny` returns the smallest value that can be represented in a floating-point number in numpy, and using it in the comparison does not provide the desired behavior.

To fix this bug, we can calculate the threshold value based on the `tiny` parameter and compare it with `maxabsvalue`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    threshold = tiny * maxabsvalue

    if maxabsvalue < threshold:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the threshold based on the `tiny` parameter and apply the expansion to `vmin` and `vmax` if the `maxabsvalue` is less than the threshold. This should address the bug in the function.
