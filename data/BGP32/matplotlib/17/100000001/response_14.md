The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from a logical error in the condition for expanding the range when the interval is too small. The issue occurs when `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, leading to incorrect adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Modify the condition for expanding the range to ensure that it accurately identifies when the interval is too small.
2. Adjust the logic for expanding `vmin` and `vmax` to handle the case when both inputs are close to zero.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny or (vmax == 0 and vmin == 0):
        correction = expander * np.maximum(np.abs([vmin, vmax]), tiny)
        vmin -= correction
        vmax += correction

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by adjusting the conditions for expanding the range and correctly handling the adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax` when the interval is too small.
