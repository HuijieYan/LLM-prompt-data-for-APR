The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect behavior:

1. The condition `if vmax < vmin:` is checking if `vmax` is less than `vmin`, but the swapping logic inside the block doesn't consider the case when `vmax` and `vmin` are equal. This could lead to incorrect behavior when `vmax` is equal to `vmin`.

2. In the calculation `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, the function should handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero, but the current implementation only considers the case when `maxabsvalue` is less than a certain threshold based on `tiny`.

To fix these issues, you can update the function as follows:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < expander or abs(vmin) < expander:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, I have added a condition in the 'elif' block to handle the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. Additionally, I simplified the condition for updating `maxabsvalue` to directly check if it is less than `tiny` without involving multiplication by a large constant.

These updates should address the potential errors in the original function and improve its correctness and reliability.
