The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities by expanding the range or swapping the endpoints if necessary. The function has several potential error locations:

1. The condition for checking if both `vmin` and `vmax` are not finite is incorrect. It should return `-expander, expander` if either one of them is not finite.
2. The calculation to determine if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded has a potential issue with using `np.finfo(float).tiny`, which might lead to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all cases correctly, specifically when one of the inputs is not finite or when the interval is too small.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditions for checking finiteness and interval size. Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version:
- The condition for checking finiteness has been corrected to return `-expander, expander` if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite.
- The condition to determine if the interval is too small has been updated to use the `tiny` threshold directly. 

These changes should address the bugs in the original function and improve its accuracy.
