The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition checking for a very small interval and the subsequent calculation that expands the interval. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not account for the case where `vmin` is negative and needs to be expanded in the opposite direction than `vmax`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the calculation within the `elif` block to handle negative `vmin` values correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            delta_v = expander * 0.5  # Calculate the half expansion amount
            vmin -= delta_v if vmin < 0 else delta_v  # Expand towards negative if vmin is negative
            vmax += delta_v if vmax > 0 else delta_v  # Expand towards positive if vmax is positive

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function correctly handles the case where `vmin` is negative and needs to be expanded in the opposite direction than `vmax`.
