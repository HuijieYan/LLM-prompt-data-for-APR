The bug in the provided function `nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True)` arises from incorrectly handling the case when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to 0. In this scenario, the function should return `-expander, expander` as mentioned in the returns section of the function's docstring. However, the current implementation does not account for this case properly, leading to incorrect outputs when both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition that checks if both inputs are very close to zero and adjust the return values accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the condition `if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` with `if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0)` to accurately check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero. This ensures that the function returns the correct values when both inputs are in that problematic range.
