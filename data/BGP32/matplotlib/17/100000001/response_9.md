### Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a given range to avoid singularities. However, there are a few potential error locations that can lead to incorrect behavior:
1. The condition `(vmax < vmin)` for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` is used without considering the case of equal values.
2. The check `if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` for handling the case when both endpoints are zero is insufficient as it doesn't consider the case when one endpoint is zero while the other is not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current code is that when `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero or equal to each other, the function doesn't handle it correctly, leading to incorrectly expanding the interval. Additionally, the condition for swapping is not taking into account the possibility of equal values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` to check for equality.
2. Improve the handling of cases when one endpoint is zero but the other is not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmax <= vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0:
            vmax = expander
            vmin = -expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) if vmin != 0 else -expander
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) if vmax != 0 else expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

In the corrected version, the conditions for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` have been updated to handle the cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are equal and when they need to be swapped based on the `increasing` parameter. Additionally, the handling of the case when one endpoint is zero has been improved to correctly set the other endpoint and expand the interval if needed.
