The bug in the given function `nonsingular` occurs when the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is being checked. This condition is used to determine whether the range of values `(vmin, vmax)` is too small and needs to be expanded. However, the comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not appropriate for this purpose.

To fix the bug, we need to properly calculate the threshold for determining if the range of values is too small. One way to do this is by comparing the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` to a small value `tiny` directly, rather than using `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, I have replaced the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` with `vmax - vmin <= tiny` for determining whether to expand the range. This change ensures that the range expansion logic is based on the direct comparison of the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` to the `tiny` threshold.
