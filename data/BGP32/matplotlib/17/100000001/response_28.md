## Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities in certain cases. The function takes initial endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, along with other parameters, and adjusts them based on certain conditions. The bug in the function lies in the logic used to check whether the interval is too small and requires expansion.

## Identified Issues:
1. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is incorrectly checking for the interval size for expansion. This condition is not correctly addressing the intended scenario where the interval is smaller than the threshold `tiny`.
2. The logic for expanding the interval in the `elif` block seems to have a fault in handling cases where both `vmax` and `vmin` are not equal to zero.
3. The logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` when `vmin` > `vmax` is not working properly due to potential inconsistencies with the `swapped` flag and the `increasing` parameter.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is mainly due to incorrect logic in both the interval expansion condition and the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` when `vmin` > `vmax`. The conditions and handling of different cases are not appropriately capturing the intended scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the condition for checking the interval size and the requirement for expansion based on the threshold `tiny`.
2. Modify the logic for expanding the interval to cover all cases correctly.
3. Adjust the swapping logic to ensure consistency based on the `increasing` parameter.
4. Improve the readability and maintainability of the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    else:
        swapped = False

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version addressed the identified issues and improved the clarity of the function. The condition for expanding the interval and the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` have been fixed to ensure correct behavior in all scenarios.
