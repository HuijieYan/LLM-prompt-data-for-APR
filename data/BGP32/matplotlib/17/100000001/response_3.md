The buggy function `nonsingular` aims to modify the endpoints of a range to prevent singularities by adjusting them if necessary. The function checks for finite values, swaps the endpoints if necessary, and expands the range based on certain conditions.

There are a couple of potential error locations within the function:
1. The condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` may not handle the case where `tiny` is very small, potentially causing issues with the precision limit.
2. The adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values in the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` may not account for the difference between positive and negative values, leading to incorrect adjustments.

The main cause of the bug in the function is potentially incorrect adjustment of the endpoints based on their absolute values without considering their signs properly. To fix this bug, we can modify the calculation of adjusted endpoints to ensure they are properly expanded while maintaining their original sign.

Here is a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*(1 if vmin >= 0 else -1)
            vmax += expander*(1 if vmax >= 0 else -1)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values has been modified to correctly consider their signs, ensuring the correct expansion and ensuring that the endpoints are adjusted properly.
