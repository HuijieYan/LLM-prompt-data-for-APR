The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug in this function occurs due to the incorrect calculation and comparison of intervals, leading to incorrect expansion or swapping of endpoints.

1. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The calculation of `maxabsvalue` where the comparison with `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` might be flawed.
   - The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` where the interval calculation is incorrect.
   - The handling of the case when `vmax == 0` and `vmin == 0` needs to be adjusted.

2. The cause of the bug lies in incorrect interval comparisons and calculations, leading to incorrect modifications of the endpoints. The incorrect condition checks result in wrongly assigning values to `vmin` and `vmax`, causing unexpected behavior.

3. To fix the bug, we need to properly calculate the interval size and implement the expansion and swapping logic correctly within the function. The threshold values and comparisons should be adjusted to handle edge cases effectively.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Calculate the interval size properly based on `vmin` and `vmax`.
   - Adjust the conditions for endpoint expansion and swapping to ensure correct behavior.
   - Handle edge cases where `vmax` or `vmin` is zero appropriately.
   - Review and revise the logic for modifying endpoints based on the given parameters `expander` and `tiny`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function `nonsingular`:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
