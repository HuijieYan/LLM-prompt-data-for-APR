The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The bug in this function arises from the logic used to check if the interval is smaller than a threshold `tiny`, which should trigger an expansion of the interval.

The bug occurs when calculating the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. The intention here is to check if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than a certain threshold `tiny`. However, the calculation `maxabsvalue * tiny` does not correctly represent this condition due to discrepancies in the comparison.

To fix this bug, we should change the condition to compare the absolute value of `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

In this corrected version, the condition `abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny` correctly compares the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with the desired threshold for expansion.
