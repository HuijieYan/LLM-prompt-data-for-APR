The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when checking if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small and needs to be expanded. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is causing the issue, leading to incorrect interval expansion when the condition is met.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the condition for interval expansion to `maxabsvalue < tiny` to ensure proper expansion based on the `tiny` threshold provided as a parameter.
2. Remove the check for `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` inside the conditional block as it may not be necessary and could lead to unwanted behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
