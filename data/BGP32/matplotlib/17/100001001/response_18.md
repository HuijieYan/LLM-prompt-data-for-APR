### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `nonsingular` function arises from the condition where `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. 

Given the runtime values and types of variables, we can clearly identify the problem:
- In Case 1, `maxabsvalue` is calculated as 1, but when compared with the threshold, the condition is not triggered, leading to no adjustment of `vmin` and `vmax`.
- In Case 2, `maxabsvalue` is calculated as 1.5, which is greater than the threshold `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, leading the function to adjust `vmin` and `vmax`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug and ensure that the adjustment is done correctly for all cases based on the given parameters, we need to revise the condition that checks for the need to adjust `vmin` and `vmax`. By comparing the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`, we can accurately determine when the adjustment is required.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if interval_size < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmax = max(vmax + expander * maxabsvalue, expander)
            vmin = max(vmin - expander * maxabsvalue, -expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

By comparing the interval size between `vmax` and `vmin` with the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`, the corrected function ensures that the adjustment is done correctly for all cases based on the given parameters.
