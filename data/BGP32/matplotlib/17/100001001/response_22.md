### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation arises from the condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, which is incorrect when dealing with negative values. This condition attempts to expand the interval if it is small, but it doesn't consider negative values or the possibility of the interval being negative.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for interval expansion to properly handle negative intervals. We should consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` instead of directly comparing their values. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    diff = abs(vmax - vmin)

    if diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) <= tiny and abs(vmin) <= tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander*maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This correction ensures that the interval expansion is applied correctly, considering both positive and negative intervals appropriately. Now the function should handle the cases provided correctly.
