The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition for determining when to modify the endpoints to avoid singularities. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not correctly handling the case when `vmin` and `vmax` have opposite signs but their absolute values are close.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to also check for the case where `vmin` and `vmax` have opposite signs. Additionally, the condition for handling the case when both inputs are very close to zero is not necessary and can be simplified.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny or (vmin < 0 and vmax > 0 and abs(vmax) < tiny):
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This should address the bug and correctly handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` have opposite signs.
