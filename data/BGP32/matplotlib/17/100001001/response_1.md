The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the condition to expand the interval is not properly handled. Specifically, when the interval is too small relative to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. 

Here is a fixed version of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

Here's the breakdown of the fix:
1.  Removed the calculation `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` as the comparison condition for interval expansion was incorrect.
2.  Changed the condition to compare `maxabsvalue` directly with `tiny` to determine if the interval needs to be expanded.

This fix addresses the bug by correctly identifying the case where the interval is too small relative to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.
