The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when handling cases where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is small and needs to be expanded. 

The bug arises due to the condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` not accounting for the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative. If both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative, their difference could be negative, causing the condition to evaluate differently than expected.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition to handle negative differences correctly. Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue < 0:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to negative differences between `vmin` and `vmax` by properly adjusting the endpoints when expanding the interval. Now the function should work correctly for all cases and return the expected results.
