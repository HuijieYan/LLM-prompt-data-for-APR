## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `nonsingular` function when the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue * tiny`. In this case, the function incorrectly expands the range by modifying `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values, which may lead to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is met. Instead of directly modifying `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values, we need to adjust the range by expanding it symmetrically around the median of `vmin` and `vmax`. This ensures that the range is expanded correctly without bias towards one endpoint over the other.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        median = (vmin + vmax) / 2
        vmin = median - (vmax - median) - expander
        vmax = median + (vmax - median) + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version symmetrically expands the range around its median when the condition for the expansion is met, effectively addressing the bug.
