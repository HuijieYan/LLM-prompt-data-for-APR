The bug in the provided `nonsingular` function lies in the condition where it checks if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is smaller than `maxabsvalue * tiny`. When `vmin` is equal to `0` and `vmax` is also equal to `0` or close to it, the function incorrectly expands the interval by subtracting and adding the `expander` value.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition in the function where the interval is determined to be smaller than a certain threshold. Instead of checking for `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0`, we should consider the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` and compare it against the `tiny` value.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        interval = abs(vmax - vmin)
        if interval <= tiny:
            vmin -= expander * 0.5
            vmax += expander * 0.5

    if not increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

In this corrected version, we properly calculate the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` to decide whether to expand it, without relying on specific values that might not accurately represent the actual range. The function also ensures that the returned endpoints are in ascending order when `increasing` is set to `False`.
