The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`, which results in incorrect expansion of the interval in some cases.

The strategy to fix this bug is to revise the condition and the calculations in the `elif` block to guarantee the correct expansion of the interval and handle singularities properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            diff = expander * maxabsvalue - (vmax - vmin) / 2
            vmin -= diff
            vmax += diff

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This modified version should correctly handle the expansion of the interval around singularities and avoid the bug present in the original function.
