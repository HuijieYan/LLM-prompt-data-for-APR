The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition where the interval is considered too small. The issue arises when both `vmin` and `vmax` are 0 or very close to zero. In that case, the function incorrectly expands the interval to `[-expander, expander]` instead of treating it as a special case.

To fix this bug, we need to add an additional check for the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. We can change the condition to check if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than `tiny`. If this condition is met, we should set `vmin` and `vmax` to `-expander` and `expander`, respectively.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This correction will properly handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero or equal.
