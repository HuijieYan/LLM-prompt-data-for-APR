### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs in the condition where it checks if both `vmax` and `vmin` are too close to each other based on the `tiny` threshold. If `vmax` and `vmin` are close enough, the function expands the range by adding `expander` to `vmax` and subtracting `expander` from `vmin`. However, in Case 3, where `vmax` and `vmin` are swapped due to `vmax` being less than `vmin`, the function incorrectly expands the endpoints in an inverted manner causing the correct result to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the expansion of the endpoints is done consistently based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. One way to achieve this is to calculate the expansions based on the absolute values of the original endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, rather than directly using `vmin` and `vmax` as in the buggy version.

### Corrected Version
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            min_expander = expander * abs(vmin)
            max_expander = expander * abs(vmax)
            vmin -= min_expander
            vmax += max_expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By calculating the expansions based on the absolute values of the original endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, the corrected function should now handle the swapping of endpoints correctly and ensure consistent behavior for expanding the range.
