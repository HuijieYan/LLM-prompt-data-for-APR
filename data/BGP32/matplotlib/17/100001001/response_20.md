In the provided code, the bug occurs in the condition where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is checked against `maxabsvalue * tiny` to determine if the interval needs to be expanded. However, the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` can lead to unexpected behavior when `vmax - vmin` is negative.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to compare the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This will ensure that the comparison is always done based on positive values.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version compares the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny` to ensure correct behavior and avoid negative intervals leading to unexpected results.
