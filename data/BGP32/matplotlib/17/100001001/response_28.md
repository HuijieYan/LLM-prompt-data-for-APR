The issue in the buggy function is due to the condition checking for a very small interval. When the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than a tiny fraction of the maximum absolute value, the function tries to adjust the values which can lead to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition for adjusting the values when the interval is too small. Instead of comparing `vmax - vmin` directly to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, we should compare the absolute difference between the endpoints to `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now handle small intervals appropriately and avoid unexpected adjustments to the endpoints.
