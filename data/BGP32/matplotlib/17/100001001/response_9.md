The bug in the `nonsingular` function occurs when the condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is met, leading to unexpected behavior in adjusting the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`. 

The issue is that the logic for adjusting the endpoints when the interval is too small is incorrect. Specifically, the line `vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)` and `vmax += expander*abs(vmax)` should be replaced to ensure that the expansion is more symmetric.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to adjust the calculation of the endpoints when the interval is too small to ensure a symmetric expansion around zero.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2
        vmin = midpoint - expander/2
        vmax = midpoint + expander/2

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that when the interval is too small, the adjustment is symmetric around the midpoint of `vmin` and `vmax`. This fix should address the bug in the function.
