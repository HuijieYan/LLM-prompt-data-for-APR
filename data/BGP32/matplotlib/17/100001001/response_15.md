The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to arise from the conditions for expanding the interval and handling cases when both input values are very small or zero. 

### Cause of the Bug:
1. For Case 1 and Case 2:
   - The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not handling the situation when the magnitude of the interval `(vmax - vmin)` is less than `tiny`. In such cases, the values of `vmin` and `vmax` should be expanded, but this is not currently happening.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` inside the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the interval between `vmax` and `vmin` is expanded when it is smaller than `tiny`. We should also handle the case when both input values are very close to zero (Case 2).

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny or (vmax == 0 and vmin == 0):
        vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin) if vmin != 0 else vmin - expander
        vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax) if vmax != 0 else vmax + expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where the interval is too small and when both input values are close to zero.
