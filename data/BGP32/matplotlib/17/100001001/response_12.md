The bug in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition that checks whether the interval is too small and needs to be expanded. The issue arises from using `np.finfo(float).tiny` as the threshold value for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints. The `tiny` value is also defined in the function and should be used as the threshold instead of `np.finfo(float).tiny`.

To fix the bug, the threshold value comparison should be updated as follows:

```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
```

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the comparisons properly and address the buggy behavior observed in the test cases.
