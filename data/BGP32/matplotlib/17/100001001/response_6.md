The bug in the `nonsingular` function stems from the conditional statements that handle cases where the interval is too small or where the values need to be swapped. The bug arises from incorrect handling of the scenario where both inputs are zero or very close to zero.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the conditional statements that check for small intervals and values too close to zero. In particular, we need to ensure that the correct adjustments are made when both `vmax` and `vmin` are zero or close to zero.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle cases where both inputs are zero or very close to zero appropriately, ensuring that the interval is expanded correctly.
