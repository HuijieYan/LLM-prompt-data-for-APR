The bug in the function "nonsingular" is related to the calculation for expanding the interval when it is too small. The issue arises when both inputs are small or close to zero, leading to incorrect adjustments to vmin and vmax.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that handles the case where both inputs are close to zero. Instead of blindly setting both endpoints to -expander and expander, we should differentiate between the case when both inputs are 0 and when both are close to zero but not exactly zero.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            # Adjust the endpoints based on the expander parameter
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            # Adjust the endpoints based on the absolute value of the inputs
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised version correctly handles the case where both inputs are close to zero by adjusting the endpoints based on their values and the expander parameter.

Please use this corrected version in your code to avoid the bug and ensure proper handling of input intervals.
