The issue in the `nonsingular` function arises from the incorrect check for a very small interval compared to the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. The comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is problematic because it does not consider the case when `vmax` and `vmin` are very close, leading to potential inaccuracies and unexpected results.

To address this issue, we can modify the conditional block related to the small interval comparison. Instead of checking for the inequality relative to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, we can directly compare the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with a small threshold, in this case, `tiny`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:  # Modified comparison here
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

By comparing `abs(vmax - vmin)` directly with `tiny`, we ensure that the function correctly handles small intervals to avoid potential inaccuracies.
