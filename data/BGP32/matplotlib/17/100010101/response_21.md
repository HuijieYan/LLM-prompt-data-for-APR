### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that an overflow is encountered during a scalar subtract operation and that an overflow is encountered when attempting to calculate the absolute value of a scalar.

Looking at the buggy function, the main issue arises when `maxabsvalue` is calculated using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` without considering the data type of `vmin` and `vmax`. If these values are int16, for example, there can be an overflow when converting them to floats.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the conversion from `vmin` and `vmax` to floats happens without encountering overflows. One way to address this is by explicitly converting `vmin` and `vmax` to floats early on in the function before any calculations are done.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    # Convert vmin and vmax to floats early to avoid overflows
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

By converting `vmin` and `vmax` to floats early on in the function, we prevent the overflows encountered during subsequent calculations. This corrected version of the function should now handle int16 values without overflow issues.
