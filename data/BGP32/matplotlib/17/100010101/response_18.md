### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, expanding the interval if needed based on certain criteria. The function checks if the inputs are finite, swaps the values if `vmax < vmin`, then calculates the maximum absolute value of the endpoints. However, there are issues with handling some edge cases, causing overflow errors.

### Issues
1. The function does not handle cases where the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` results in an overflow while computing `maxabsvalue`.
2. If `vmax` and `vmin` are very close and their difference is less than the product of `maxabsvalue * tiny`, it tries to adjust them but does not handle this adjustment correctly.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the calculation of `maxabsvalue` does not result in overflow by casting the values to appropriate types.
2. Adjust the approach to expand the range when `vmax - vmin` is very small compared to `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

### Code Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # Handle overflow by casting to float

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < expander and abs(vmin) < expander:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if vmax == 0:
                vmax = expander
            if vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / (1 + tiny)  # Adjust based on ratio of vmin and vmax to allow differentiation
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / (1 + tiny)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with overflow and the adjustment process, ensuring the function behaves correctly in all cases.
