## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to potential overflow issues when performing absolute operations in the `nonsingular` function. The error messages indicate that some calculations within the function are encountering overflow, leading to runtime warnings.

### Issue Summary
1. In Case 5 and Case 7, there is an issue with maxabsvalue calculation resulting in overflow during the absolute value computation.
2. Cases 1, 2, and 3 are handling integer values but might be prone to truncation during type conversion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of integer and float data types within the function to prevent truncation issues.
2. Adjust the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to avoid overflow by employing a safer strategy.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmax == vmin == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    tiny_limit = 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny

    if maxvalue < tiny_limit:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

By using consistent float calculations and adjusting the method to compute `maxvalue`, the modified `nonsingular` function should now be able to handle the cases without encountering overflow issues.
