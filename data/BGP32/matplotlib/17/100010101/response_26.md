## Bug Analysis
The buggy `nonsingular` function is not handling extreme values properly, resulting in overflow warnings for scalar subtraction and absolute value operations. This is likely occurring when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is large compared to their absolute values.

The bug is likely caused by comparing large floating-point numbers and not accounting for the possibility of overflow during subtraction and absolute value operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle extreme values by modifying the calculation logic in the `nonsingular` function. Specifically, we should ensure that arithmetic operations involving `vmin` and `vmax` do not lead to overflow-induced warnings.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= 2 * expander:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            range_diff = vmax - vmin
            midpoint = (vmax + vmin) / 2.0
            vmin = midpoint - (expander / 2.0)
            vmax = midpoint + (expander / 2.0)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

Now the corrected `nonsingular` function should handle extreme values correctly without triggering overflow warnings.
