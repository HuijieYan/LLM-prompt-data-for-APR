The bug in the function `nonsingular` arises due to potential overflow during calculations involving floating-point numbers. This overflow leads to the `RuntimeWarning` messages encountered in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the calculations are performed using floating-point numbers and avoid potential overflow issues by improving the comparison logic and ensuring increased precision. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny * 10:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

This corrected version incorporates proper type conversion to `float` and upgrades the precision in comparisons to avoid overflow issues. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the specified input/output expectations. Make sure to test the fixed function to ensure its correctness and performance.
