### Analysis
The function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The error message indicates that an overflow occurred when calculating the differences or absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

#### Identified Issues:
1. The comparison condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` might cause an overflow issue.
2. Computing `maxabsvalue` as `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` could trigger an overflow warning if applied to large numbers.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by an overflow error due to large values used in calculations, especially when subtracting `vmin` from `vmax` or calculating the absolute value of large numbers.

### Proposed Fix
To avoid overflow errors, refactor the function to handle large numbers without triggering warnings. One possible approach is to reformulate the approach for when values are close to each other or near the edge of representable precision.

### Corrected Function
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    eps = tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny
    if vmax - vmin <= eps:
        if np.isclose(vmin, 0) and np.isclose(vmax, 0):
            return -expander, expander
        vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return float(vmin), float(vmax)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle large and small values without triggering overflow errors.
