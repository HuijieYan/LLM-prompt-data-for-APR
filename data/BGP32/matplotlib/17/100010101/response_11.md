The issue with the current implementation of the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle edge cases properly, resulting in overflow warnings during certain calculations. The main problem arises when trying to subtract `vmax` from `vmin` in the expression `vmax - vmin`, causing overflow warnings.

To fix this issue, a strategy would involve adjusting the calculations taking place within the function to prevent overflow.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the edge cases appropriately, avoiding overflow warnings during calculations and satisfying all the input/output requirements specified in the expected cases.
