### Analysis
The buggy function `nonsingular` is intended to handle cases where the input vmin and vmax may need to be modified to avoid singularities. The function checks if the input values are valid, if they need to be swapped, and then modifies the values based on specific conditions related to their magnitude and proximity.

The error messages indicate two potential issues:
1. Overflow encountered during scalar subtraction.
2. Overflow encountered during scalar absolute operation.

Both errors are related to arithmetic operations in the function that are outside the bounds of normal calculations, likely due to excessively large values or small differences between vmax and vmin.

### Bugs
1. The condition that checks for excessively small intervals (if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny) can lead to overflow issues if the values are too large.
2. The calculation of maxabsvalue, based on the maximum of absolute values of vmin and vmax, could also lead to overflow if the values are extremely large. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs, we need to handle cases where the values of vmin and vmax are very large without leading to overflow errors. Additionally, we need to ensure that the calculations are well within the bounds of normal arithmetic operations.

### The corrected function
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Handle case of excessive maxabsvalue to avoid overflow
    if maxabsvalue > 1e6:
        factor = maxabsvalue / 1e6
        vmin /= factor
        vmax /= factor

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            # Use relative fraction to avoid overflow
            factor = expander / maxabsvalue
            vmin -= factor * abs(vmin)
            vmax += factor * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

### Testing the fixes
Now that the function has been corrected, it should pass the failing test cases provided earlier. The corrected function ensures that the calculations stay within reasonable bounds to avoid overflow issues.
