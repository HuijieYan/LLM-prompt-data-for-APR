### Analysis
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which is not correctly implemented in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_recache` function is not setting the correct value for the `_filled` attribute, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object not being set to the correct value during the `_recache` function. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, causing the failing assertion in the test.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided while creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be achieved by updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
