Based on the provided information, it's clear that the `_recache` function is not properly handling the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail. The failing test is expecting the marker to not be filled when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the `_recache` function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter when initializing the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By assigning the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the correct fill state is maintained for the marker, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
