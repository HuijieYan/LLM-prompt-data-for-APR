The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This behavior can lead to errors such as the one observed in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we should return from the function to prevent any errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not None, avoiding the error encountered in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
