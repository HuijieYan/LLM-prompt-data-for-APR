The bug in the `_recache` function arises from not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the initialization of `MarkerStyle`.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is not being set according to the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `fillstyle` parameter is not being considered in the `_recache` function, which results in `_filled` always being set to `True`, leading to the `is_filled` method producing incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now pass the failing test.
