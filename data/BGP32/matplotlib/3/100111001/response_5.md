The issue in the provided `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is a valid function. This causes an AttributeError when attempting to call a non-existent function, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`, the creation of `marker_style` involves passing `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'` to `MarkerStyle`.
- The `MarkerStyle` class doesn't have a `is_filled()` method defined explicitly. When the `is_filled()` method is called in the failing test, it is trying to access a non-existent method, resulting in an error.
- This is because the `_recache` function sets the attribute `_marker_function` but doesn't ensure that it is a valid function during the recaching process. So, when `_marker_function` is called in `_recache`, it leads to an AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is a valid function before calling it in the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. This modification will prevent the AttributeError and allow the `MarkerStyle` object to function correctly in tests like `test_marker_fillstyle()`.
