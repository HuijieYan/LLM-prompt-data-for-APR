### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, but it is missing the essential step of setting the `self._marker_function` attribute. This leads to a failure in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class because it tries to call `self._marker_function()` which is `None`.

### Bug Cause
The missing assignment of `self._marker_function` results in a `None` value, which is then called in the `is_filled` method, causing an error.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to set the `self._marker_function` attribute to a valid function that properly handles the marker style. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        self._marker_function = self._set_marker_function()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

def _set_marker_function(self):
    # Define the function here that will handle the marker style
    pass
```

In this corrected version, `_set_marker_function()` should be implemented to handle the marker style appropriately. When the `_recache()` method is called, it checks if `_marker_function` is `None` and initializes it with `_set_marker_function()` if needed.
