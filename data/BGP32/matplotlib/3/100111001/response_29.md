The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists, which leads to an assertion error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` test.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `_marker_function` is not set, the function should return early to avoid calling a non-existent function. In this case, the `_marker_function` is not checked before calling it, resulting in an error where the `is_filled` method cannot be accessed.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, the function should return early.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function fixed
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check for `self._marker_function is None`, we ensure that the function will not attempt to call a non-existent function, preventing the assertion error in the test.
