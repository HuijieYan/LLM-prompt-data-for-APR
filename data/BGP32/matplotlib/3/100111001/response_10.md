The issue in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually defined. This causes an error when trying to call a function that does not exist, leading to a failure in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
