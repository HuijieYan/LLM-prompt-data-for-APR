### Bug Explanation:

In the `_recache` function, the bug occurs when the `_marker_function` is called without checking whether it's defined or not. This leads to an assertion error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` test function when trying to call the `is_filled` method on the `MarkerStyle` object, as the `_marker_function` is not properly set up.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly defined and only called if it exists. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before executing it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding this condition, the `_marker_function` will only be called if it's not `None`, preventing the assertion error during the test.
