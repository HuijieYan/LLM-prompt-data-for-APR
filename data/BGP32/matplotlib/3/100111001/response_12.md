### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object based on the marker function. However, in its current state, it is not actually calling the marker function (`self._marker_function()`). This leads to the attributes not being properly updated, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` not being called within the `_recache` function, resulting in the attributes not being correctly updated.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called within the `_recache` function to update the necessary attributes.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the line `self._marker_function()` within the `_recache` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
