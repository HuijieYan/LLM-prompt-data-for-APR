The buggy function `_recache` is intended to update various attributes of a marker style based on a marker function. However, the bug occurs because the `self._marker_function` is not called before updating the attributes, resulting in incorrect values and behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker and fill style specified. The `test_marker_fillstyle` test asserts that the fill style is set correctly but fails in asserting that the marker is not filled, revealing the bug.

The error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly. This indicates that the `_filled` attribute is not correctly updated by the `_recache` function due to the missing call to `self._marker_function()` before updating the attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_marker_function` is called before updating the marker style attributes inside the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._marker_function()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

By calling `self._marker_function()` before updating the attributes, the marker style will be correctly updated based on the marker function, resolving the bug.
