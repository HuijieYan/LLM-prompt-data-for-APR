The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually a callable object. This leads to an error when trying to call `self._marker_function()` in cases where it is not defined, causing the test to fail.

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we should skip the function call.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if callable(self._marker_function):` check, we ensure that `_marker_function` is a callable object before trying to call it. This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
