The issue in the provided code lies in the `_recache` function. The function sets default values to various attributes without checking if they are available in the first place. This leads to the `_marker_function` being called without actually checking if it exists, causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`, resolving the issue and allowing the test to pass successfully.
