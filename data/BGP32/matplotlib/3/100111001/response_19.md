### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is not None. This leads to an error when the function tries to call a None object.

### Fix strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we prevent the function from trying to call a None object and resolve the bug.
