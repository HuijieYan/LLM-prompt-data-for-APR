### Bug Explanation
In the `_recache` function, the issue seems to be related to the `_marker_function()` call which is not properly setting the values for `_filled` attribute. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` instead of the expected value `False`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_marker_function()` correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the provided inputs. Additionally, since the `_marker_function` is not directly defined in the given code snippet, we need to ensure that it properly sets all the required attributes for the MarkerStyle object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value as expected in the test.

With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` should now pass successfully.
