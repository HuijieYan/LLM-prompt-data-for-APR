### Correction:

The bug in the `_recache` function is that even when `self._filled` is set to `False`, the function always sets it back to `True` at the end. This behavior contradicts the expected output values where `self._filled` should be set to `False`. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the assignment of `self._filled` based on the fillstyle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute will be properly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing the test case for `is_filled()` to pass as expected.
