### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style settings. This is causing the test to fail when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Error Cause
The `_recache` function does not update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style settings, leading to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled. This results in the failing test where the expected value for `_filled` is False instead of True.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated according to the marker style settings provided during initialization. This can be achieved by setting `_filled` based on the specific fillstyle specified.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'full':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional statement to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` parameter. If `_fillstyle` is set to 'full', then `_filled` is set to True, indicating that the marker should be filled. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to False. This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute reflects the intended marker style settings, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case.
