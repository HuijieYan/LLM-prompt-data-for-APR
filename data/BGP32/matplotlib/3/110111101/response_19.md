### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to update the `_filled` attribute correctly, resulting in the assertion error in the failing test. The function is setting `_filled = True` unconditionally, regardless of the specified fillstyle.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of `_filled` to `True` regardless of the specified fillstyle. This leads to the failing test where the expected `_filled` value is `False`, but the function sets it to `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include logic to update the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected version of the function ensures that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct value according to the specified fillstyle, resolving the bug.
