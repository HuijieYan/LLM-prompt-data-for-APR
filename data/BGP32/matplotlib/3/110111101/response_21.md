### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes based on the marker function, but it doesn't correctly handle the filling style of the marker, leading to failed tests.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` asserts that the marker's filling style is `'none'` and that it is not filled, but the current implementation doesn't update the `_filled` attribute based on the filling style.
- The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the filling style set for the marker when the function is called.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should update the `_filled` attribute based on the filling style provided when the function is called.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'full']
        self._marker_function()
```

By including the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none', 'full']`, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the filling style set for the marker. This change ensures that the `_filled` attribute correctly reflects whether the marker should be filled or not.
