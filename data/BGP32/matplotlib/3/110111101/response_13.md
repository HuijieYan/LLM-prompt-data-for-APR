### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update certain attributes based on the value of `self._marker_function`. However, in the current implementation, the function is being called regardless of its existence or value, leading to unexpected behavior and the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by unconditionally calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is `None` or not. This results in the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returning `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it to avoid unwanted side effects.
- Consider setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute if necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
``` 

By incorporating the fix, the function will now correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute value. This correction should ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
