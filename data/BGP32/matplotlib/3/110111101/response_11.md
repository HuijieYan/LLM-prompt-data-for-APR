### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is called when certain attributes are not None, and it sets default values for several attributes. However, it also calls a `_marker_function` which is not defined in the provided code snippet.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker style is not filled, but the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the buggy function.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fixed to set _filled to False
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` instead of `True`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
