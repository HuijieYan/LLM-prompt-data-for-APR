### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reinitialize various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. However, in its current state, it is not correctly handling the `filled` attribute. The function is resetting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end, which is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. The failing test expects `_filled` to be `False` after setting `fillstyle='none'`, but the function resets it to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should remain `True`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Fixed _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should now properly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
