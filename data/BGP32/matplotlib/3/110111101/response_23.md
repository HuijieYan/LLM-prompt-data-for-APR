### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to default values. It calls a `_marker_function` which is assumed to be defined in the class but is missing in the provided code.
2. The failing test tries to check if the `MarkerStyle` object is filled or not.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the function `_recache`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the fillstyle specified in the constructor of `MarkerStyle`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking if the `fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, we ensure that the `filled` attribute is set correctly to `True` or `False` based on the specified fill style.

This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
