### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly. The function initializes `_filled` to `True` at the start even if `self._marker_function` exists.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the logic within the `_recache` function. If `_marker_function` exists, we should set `_filled` to `False`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._filled is None and self._marker_function:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By including the condition `if self._filled is None and self._marker_function` to check if the `_filled` attribute is not already set and `_marker_function` exists, we can set `_filled` to `False` as intended. This correction should ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test cases.
