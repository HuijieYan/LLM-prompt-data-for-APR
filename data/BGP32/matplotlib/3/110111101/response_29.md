### Fixing the Bug
The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists, causing errors when trying to access attributes that should be set by `_marker_function`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is called only if it exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists.

This correction will prevent errors from occurring and allow the function to proceed with setting the necessary attributes based on the `_marker_function`.

With this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass as expected.
