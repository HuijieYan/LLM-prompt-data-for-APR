### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle set externally while creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the `is_filled()` method to always return `True` when it should return `False` based on the `fillstyle` attribute that was set during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. This is the reason for the failing test assertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fill style set in the `MarkerStyle` object based on the `fillstyle` parameter during object creation.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to reflect the actual fillstyle set, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly returns `False` when the fillstyle is 'none' and `True` otherwise. This correction should resolve the failing test and match the expected behavior.
