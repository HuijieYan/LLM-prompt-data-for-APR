## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes some attributes and then calls a `marker_function` (which is not shown in the provided code). The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method does not return the expected value, which suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the initialization of `MarkerStyle`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly initialized based on the `fillstyle` parameter. We will modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Fix the bug by checking fillstyle and setting _filled accordingly
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during initialization, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
