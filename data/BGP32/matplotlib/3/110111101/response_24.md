### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object to default values. However, the bug is in the line where it calls `self._marker_function()` without initializing the `self._marker_function` attribute properly. This leads to an attribute error when trying to call the function.

### Bug Cause
- The buggy function does not check if the `self._marker_function` attribute is initialized before calling it.
- In the failing test, the `is_filled` method depends on the `self._filled` attribute, which is not correctly set to `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `self._marker_function` attribute is properly initialized and handle the case where it is not set. Additionally, we need to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle.

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            if self._marker_function is not None:
                self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the existence of `self._marker_function` before calling it, and setting the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle value, we can fix the bug in the `_recache` function. This updated version should now pass the failing test.
