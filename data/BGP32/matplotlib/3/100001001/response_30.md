The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is None, we should simply return from the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not None, avoiding any AttributeError.
