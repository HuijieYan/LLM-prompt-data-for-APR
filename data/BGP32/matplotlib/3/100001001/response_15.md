The buggy function `_recache` sets default values for various attributes of an object but encounters an issue when calling the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or is defined. This results in a potential error as `_marker_function` may not be defined, causing the function to raise an exception.

To fix this bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined, preventing any potential errors or exceptions.
