The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where the function is being called without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually defined or not. The function is only being executed if `_marker_function` is not None, which can lead to unexpected behavior if `_marker_function` is not initialized.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before attempting to call it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to ensure _marker_function is defined
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding this check, we ensure that `_marker_function` is only executed if it has been defined, preventing any potential errors from calling an undefined function.
