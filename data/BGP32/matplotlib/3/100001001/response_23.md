The bug in the provided function is that it attempts to call the `_marker_function` attribute even if it is `None`, which will result in a `NoneType` object is not callable error.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure the function is only called when it's actually defined, preventing the error.
