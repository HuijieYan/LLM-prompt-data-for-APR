The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `_marker_function` without setting `self._marker_function` first, which will lead to an AttributeError when running the function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is set before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if callable(self._marker_function):` check, we ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to execute it, preventing the AttributeError.
