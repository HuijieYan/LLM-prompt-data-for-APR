The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is actually a callable object. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or if it's not a function.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self._marker_function` is callable before trying to execute it. This can be done using the `callable()` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case when _marker_function is not defined or not callable
        # you can raise an exception or log a message
        pass
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` condition, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined and callable. This will prevent any errors that may occur due to calling a non-existent or non-callable function.
