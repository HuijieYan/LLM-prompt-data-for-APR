The bug in the `_recache` function is that it leads to an AttributeError due to calling the `_marker_function` without the necessary initialization of `self._marker_function`. This happens because the function is checking `self._marker_function` for None before any assignment.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `self._marker_function` is assigned a valid function before calling it.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if callable(self._marker_function)` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that it is safe to execute the function and avoid the AttributeError.
