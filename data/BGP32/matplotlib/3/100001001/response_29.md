### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing a key step of setting the `_marker_function` attribute to `None` after calling it. This omission leads to an infinite loop if the `_marker_function` modifies any of the attributes that the function is resetting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Add a line to set `self._marker_function` to `None` after calling it in the `_recache` function to prevent the infinite loop.
- This adjustment will ensure that the function does not continue to repeatedly call `_marker_function` once it has been executed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function
    self._marker_function = None  # Set it to None to prevent the infinite loop
```
