### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting certain attributes of an object, including the path, transform, snap threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled status. It then calls a marker function if it is not `None`. 

From the provided runtime values, we can see that the `_path` attribute is set to `_empty_path`, but in the case, it is assigned a specific `Path` object. This is probably unintended and causing issues with the behavior of the marker.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of the `_path` attribute within the `_recache` function.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_path` attribute is correctly handled. We can update the function to set `_path` to `_empty_path` when recalibrating the object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
