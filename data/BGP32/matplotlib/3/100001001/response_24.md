The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it tries to call `self._marker_function()` without checking whether `self._marker_function` is `None` or not, resulting in a `TypeError` when it is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
