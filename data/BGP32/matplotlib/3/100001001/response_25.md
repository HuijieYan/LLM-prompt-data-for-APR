The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to call a function (`self._marker_function()`) without checking if it exists, which can lead to a `TypeError` if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to ensure _marker_function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding this check, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that could occur.
