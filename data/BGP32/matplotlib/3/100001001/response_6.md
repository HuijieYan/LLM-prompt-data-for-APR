### Analysis
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the `_path` attribute is not being correctly set to an empty path (`_empty_path`) as intended.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the incorrect assignment of the `_path` attribute. It is being set to an erroneous value instead of `_empty_path`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_path` attribute is correctly set to `_empty_path` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By calling `_empty_path()` instead of assigning `_path` directly to `_empty_path`, we can ensure that the `_path` attribute is correctly set to an empty path.
