### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to update several attributes of an object based on its marker function. However, the bug lies in the fact that it attempts to call the marker function even when it is not defined (`self._marker_function is None`). This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially if the marker function is crucial to defining the object's properties.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check before calling the marker function in the `_recache` function. If `self._marker_function` is `None`, then the function should return without executing the marker function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
