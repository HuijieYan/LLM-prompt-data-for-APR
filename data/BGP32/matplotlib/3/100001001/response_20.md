The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists, which can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `_marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is None:` before calling the function, we ensure that the function will only be called if it is defined, avoiding the `NoneType` error.
