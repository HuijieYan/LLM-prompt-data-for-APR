The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the logic where it calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors when the `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to ensure that the `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function without performing any further operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call the `_marker_function` if it is defined, preventing any errors related to calling a function that doesn't exist.
