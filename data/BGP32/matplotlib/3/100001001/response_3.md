The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call a function stored in `self._marker_function` without checking if `self._marker_function` actually exists. This results in an AttributeError when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it exists, avoiding the AttributeError.
