The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the way the function initializes the `_path` variable. It sets `_path` to `_empty_path` unconditionally when it should be setting it to a new Path object if `_marker_function` is not None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before setting the `_path` variable to a new Path object. If `_marker_function` is not None, we should assign a new Path object to `_path`. Otherwise, `_path` should remain as `_empty_path`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = Path()
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    else:
        self._path = _empty_path
        
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this adjustment to the `_recache` function, it will correctly initialize the `_path` variable based on the presence of the `_marker_function` and prevent the bug.
