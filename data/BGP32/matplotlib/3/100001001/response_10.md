### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to reset certain attributes to their initial values before calling the `_marker_function`. However, there seems to be an issue as the `_path` variable is being set to `_empty_path` instead of being reset to its default value, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug
The bug lies in the assignment of the `_path` variable. It should be set to its default value instead of `_empty_path`.

### Fix
Update the `_recache` function by correcting the assignment of the `_path` variable to its default value. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = Path()  # Set _path to its default value
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
