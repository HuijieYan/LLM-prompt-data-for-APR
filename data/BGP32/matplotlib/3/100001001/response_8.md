### Explanation:
The _recache function is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and then execute a marker function. However, the buggy function fails to properly reset the _path attribute to an empty path before executing the marker function. This can cause unexpected behavior in the marker function if it relies on the _path attribute being in a certain state.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly reset the _path attribute to an empty path before calling the marker function. This can be achieved by initializing the _path attribute to an empty path (e.g., _empty_path) at the beginning of the _recache function.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
