Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it calls `self._marker_function()` unconditionally without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not properly defined or set to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is checked before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is properly defined. This should fix the bug and prevent any errors related to calling an undefined function.
