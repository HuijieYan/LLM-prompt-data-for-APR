### Analyzing the buggy function
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of an object, and then call a marker function if it is defined. However, based on the runtime values provided in Case 1, the `_path` variable is set to `_empty_path` before the function call, but it seems to retain its value afterward. This suggests that the function is not resetting the `_path` attribute correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is that it does not properly reset the `_path` attribute to the intended value of `_empty_path`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_path` attribute is set to `_empty_path` as intended. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
