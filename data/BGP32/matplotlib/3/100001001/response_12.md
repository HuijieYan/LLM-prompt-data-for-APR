The bug in the provided function is that it is missing the assignment of the `_marker_function` attribute before calling it. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to call a function that has not been assigned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is assigned before calling it in the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
