The bug in the given function is that it is trying to execute a marker function (`self._marker_function()`) without checking if it exists or not. This results in a potential AttributeError if the `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this issue, we need to add a null check for `_marker_function` before attempting to execute it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the null check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before executing `_marker_function()`, we ensure that we only call the function when it is actually defined and avoid any potential AttributeError.
