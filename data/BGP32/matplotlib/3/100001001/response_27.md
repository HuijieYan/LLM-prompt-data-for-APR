The issue in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call a function `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or if it is callable. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined or if it is not a callable object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before trying to call it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not None and if it is a callable object. This will prevent any `TypeError` that may occur due to calling a non-callable object.
