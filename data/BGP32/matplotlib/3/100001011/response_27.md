### Analysis:
1. The buggy `_recache` function is designed to reinitialize marker properties based on the `_marker_function`. However, the issue with markers not being hollow as expected indicates a problem with the setting of `_filled`.
2. The input values and types provided in Case 1 reveal that `_filled` is set to `True`, which leads to markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
3. The bug is caused by `_filled` being set to `True` by default, making the markers filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` to create hollow markers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and adjust the value of `_filled` accordingly.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Check the value of `fillstyle` in `_recache` and update `_filled` based on it.
2. If `fillstyle='none'`, set `_filled` to `False` to create hollow markers.
3. Otherwise, keep `_filled` as `True` for filled markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the value of `_filled` is dependent on the `fillstyle` parameter of the marker. This adjustment ensures that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
