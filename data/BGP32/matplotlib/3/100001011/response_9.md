### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes of an object. However, it fails to correctly reset the `_path` attribute, leading to unexpected behavior when using custom markers in matplotlib.

### Error Location:
The bug lies in the `_recache` function's failure to properly reset the `_path` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The `_path` attribute is being assigned the value of `_empty_path` instead of reinitializing it. This leads to the previous path data being retained, causing unexpected marker behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly reset the `_path` attribute to a new empty `Path` object during the re-caching process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = Path()  # Reset _path to an empty Path object
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By resetting the `_path` attribute to a new empty `Path` object, we ensure that any previous path data is cleared, resolving the issue of markers not appearing hollow as expected.
