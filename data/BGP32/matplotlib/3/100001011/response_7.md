### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset several attributes related to markers in matplotlib. However, the issue lies in the fact that it calls `self._marker_function()` unconditionally without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists.
2. Possible issues with values not being correctly reset to their default states.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the unconditional call to `self._marker_function()` without verifying its existence. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior, potentially affecting the marker's appearance when setting fillstyle to 'none'.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it.
2. Make sure all attributes are correctly reset to their default values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

By adding a check for `self._marker_function` before calling it, we ensure that the function is only executed if it's defined. This should prevent any potential errors related to calling an undefined function.
