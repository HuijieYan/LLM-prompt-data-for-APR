### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is responsible for reinitializing specific properties of a marker object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` should result in hollow markers, but currently, that is not the case. The issue arises from the fact that the `_filled` property is being set to `True` unconditionally inside the `_recache` function, which overrides the desired behavior of having hollow markers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` property being set to `True` regardless of the input parameters passed when creating a custom `MarkerStyle`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when determining whether the marker should be filled or not. We should set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter value passed during the creation of the `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as expected by the user in the GitHub issue.
