The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling the `_marker_function()` without checking if it exists, leading to a potential error. Given the runtime values and types of variables provided, we see that the return values are not directly related to the input parameters or the conditional check on `_marker_function`, possibly leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only call `_marker_function()` if it has been initialized. Additionally, we should check if `_marker_function` is a callable function before invoking it to avoid runtime errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function()` if it is not `None` and is callable, preventing any potential runtime errors.
