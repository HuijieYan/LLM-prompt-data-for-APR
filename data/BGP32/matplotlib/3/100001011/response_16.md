### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` is setting default values for various attributes like `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, etc., and then calling the `_marker_function()`. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that markers are not hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`, which indicates a problem with how the marker is being handled or drawn.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache()` function, which may contradict the desired behavior of creating hollow markers.
2. The `_marker_function()` might not be handling the `fillstyle='none'` properly, leading to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is likely the default setting of `_filled` to `True`, which forces the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. Additionally, the way the `_marker_function()` handles the `fillstyle` parameter might also contribute to the incorrect rendering of markers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_recache()` function to handle the `fillstyle='none'` correctly by respecting the desired hollow marker behavior.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function()` appropriately interprets and applies the `fillstyle` parameter to create hollow markers when required.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Based on the analysis and potential error locations, here is a corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check fillstyle for hollow markers
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle parameter to allow for proper handling of hollow markers. Make sure that the `_marker_function()` correctly processes the fillstyle information for the markers as well.
