### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is caused by the `self._filled = True` line of code. When setting `self._filled = True`, the markers are being filled, even if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This directly relates to the GitHub issue where the user is trying to create hollow markers but is not achieving the desired outcome.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that hollow markers are correctly displayed when requested.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle to determine filled status
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the markers should now correctly display as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
