### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is designed to reinitialize various attributes when called. However, in its current state:
1. It improperly calls `self._marker_function()` without any checks or conditions, potentially causing issues.
2. It does not consider the `fillstyle` attribute in the context of markers.

### Bug Cause:
The issue reported on GitHub describes the problem with markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set, indicating that the `fillstyle` attribute is not being handled correctly. The `_recache` function does not consider `fillstyle` when resetting attributes, leading to markers not appearing as hollow when intended.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is properly handled in the `_recache` function to achieve the desired behavior of hollow markers. Additionally, we should evaluate the necessity of calling `self._marker_function()` without any conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    fillstyle = getattr(self, '_fillstyle', 'full')
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'
    
    if fillstyle != 'none':
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we retrieve the `fillstyle` attribute from the marker and adjust the `_filled` value accordingly. The `_marker_function` is only called if `fillstyle != 'none'` to ensure that the markers appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
