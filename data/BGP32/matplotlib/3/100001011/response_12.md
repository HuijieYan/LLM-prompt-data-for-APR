### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset various attributes of a marker object before calling a marker function. However, in its current state, the `self._marker_function()` is always called regardless of whether it is `None` or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in cases where the marker function is supposed to handle further configuration.

### Error Locations
1. In the conditional check `if self._marker_function is None`, the comparison should be checking if `self._marker_function` is not equal to `None`.
2. The call to `self._marker_function()` should be inside the condition where `self._marker_function` is not `None`, to avoid calling it when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the marker function to be called even when it is `None`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and possibly cause issues like markers not being hollow when expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, you should:
1. Change the conditional check to verify if `self._marker_function` is not equal to `None`.
2. Move the call to `self._marker_function()` inside the condition where `self._marker_function` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making the above corrections, the marker function will only be called if it is not `None`, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
