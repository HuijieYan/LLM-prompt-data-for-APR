### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing the necessary steps to correctly handle the case where the marker should be set as hollow. In the provided runtime values, we see that `self._filled` is set to `True`, indicating that the markers are filled by default. This results in the markers not appearing hollow as expected in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering the `fillstyle` parameter when determining if the marker should be filled or hollow. The current implementation only sets `_filled` to `True` by default, leading to filled markers even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter when deciding whether the marker should be filled or hollow. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should set `_filled` to `False`, indicating a hollow marker.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By including the check for the `fillstyle` parameter and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected code will now display hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
