### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes to default values, but it fails to correctly reset the `_filled` attribute. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to set markers as hollow.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect resetting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` within the `_recache` function. This causes markers to remain filled even when attempting to set them as hollow with the `fillstyle='none'` parameter.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly reset to `False` when calling the `_recache` function. This fix will allow the markers to properly appear hollow when desired.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Reset _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By correcting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, the markers will now correctly appear as hollow when specified in the `fillstyle='none'` parameter as intended.
