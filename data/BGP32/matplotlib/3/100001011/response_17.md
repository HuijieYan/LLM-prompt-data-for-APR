### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset various attributes to default values when called. The issue described on GitHub indicates that markers are not appearing as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. Based on the runtime values provided in Case 1, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` within the function, which is causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is due to setting `_filled = True`, which contradicts the expectation of having hollow markers. The attribute `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve the desired hollow marker appearance.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` instead of `True` to ensure that markers are hollow when the fillstyle is 'none'.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change in the corrected version, the markers will now appear hollow as intended, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
