The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which prevents the markers from being displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is specified. This issue is directly related to the GitHub issue where the user wants to create hollow markers but is unable to achieve it due to the bug in the `_recache` function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to display hollow markers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed, and users should be able to create hollow markers as expected.
