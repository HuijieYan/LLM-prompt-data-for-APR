### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. However, in the provided buggy code, the `self._path` attribute is being assigned to `_empty_path` without considering other marker attributes, resulting in incorrect behavior when creating markers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes markers to not behave as expected when using `ax.scatter()` and setting markers to be hollow. This behavior is due to the incorrect assignment of `_empty_path` to `self._path` without resetting other marker attributes.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, modify the `_recache` function to reset all relevant marker attributes to default values before calling the marker function. This ensures that all marker properties are correctly set before creating markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True

    # Reset additional marker attributes to default values
    self._snap = None
    self._sketch = None
    self._sketch_pad = None
    self._sketch_angle = None
    self._path_effects = []
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By resetting the additional marker attributes to default values, the corrected version ensures that all relevant properties are correctly set for markers, fixing the issue described in the GitHub report.
