### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is assigned. This leads to unexpected behavior when the function is invoked with an undefined function, causing errors in marker styling, as seen in the GitHub issue where markers appear filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. This can be done by adding a condition to check if it is not `None` before calling it.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is assigned, avoiding errors related to undefined functions and resolving the issue with markers not appearing as hollow.
