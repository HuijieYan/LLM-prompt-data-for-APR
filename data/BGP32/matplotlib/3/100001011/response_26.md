### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file in the matplotlib library. When the `_marker_function` is called, the function is expected to update the values of `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. However, it seems that these values are not being updated correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when custom marker styles are used.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `_marker_function` might not be updating the required attributes correctly.
- The assignment of default values in the `_recache` function might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
Based on the runtime values and types, it appears that the `_recache` function is resetting the `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes to default values before calling `_marker_function`. This leads to the custom marker style not being properly applied, as the expected updates are overwritten.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_marker_function` updates the required attributes correctly. Additionally, modify the `_recache` function to set the default values after calling `_marker_function` to retain the custom marker style settings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._marker_function()
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
``` 

By rearranging the order of operations in the `_recache` function, ensuring that the custom marker settings are applied before resetting default values, the bug should be resolved. This change ensures that the custom marker style is correctly retained and applied when using `MarkerStyle` with custom fillstyle settings.
