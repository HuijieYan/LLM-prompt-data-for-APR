### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function` method. In this case, it seems that the issue lies with the `self._filled` attribute, which is set to `True` by default. This causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified in the marker style.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, it overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting specified in the marker style. As a result, the markers are not hollow as expected.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute respects the `fillstyle='none'` setting. We can update the condition for `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the marker style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'full' or 'none'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check the `fillstyle` parameter in the marker style and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change will ensure that the markers are correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
