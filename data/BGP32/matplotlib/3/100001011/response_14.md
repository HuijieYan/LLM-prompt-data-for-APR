### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of an object, but it fails to call the marker function that updates these attributes properly. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to customize markers.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug seems to be in the fact that the `_marker_function` is not being called as intended after resetting the attributes of the object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the `_marker_function` not being invoked after resetting the object's attributes. This results in markers not being rendered correctly when customizing them.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We should ensure that after resetting the object's attributes, the `_marker_function` is called to update the necessary properties so that the customization of markers works correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the function `_recache` that ensures the `_marker_function` is properly called after resetting the attributes:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    # Call _marker_function to update marker properties
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By incorporating this modification, the markers will be correctly rendered as intended, allowing for customization as desired.
