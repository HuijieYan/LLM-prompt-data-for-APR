### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is caused by the line `self._filled = True`, which sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the marker style. This leads to markers being filled even when the intention is to make them hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle provided in the marker style. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Adjust _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
    
def get_fillstyle(self):
    if self._fillstyle is not None:
        return self._fillstyle
    return 'full'  # Default to 'full' if fillstyle is not explicitly set
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle provided in the marker style. If the fillstyle is not `'none'`, `_filled` will be set to `True` (indicating that the marker is filled), otherwise, `_filled` will be set to `False` (indicating that the marker is hollow). The `get_fillstyle` method is introduced to retrieve the fillstyle from the marker style, defaulting to `'full'` if not explicitly set.
