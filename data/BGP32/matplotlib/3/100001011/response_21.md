### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes of a marker with default values and then calling a function stored in `_marker_function`. However, in the provided runtime values and types, it seems like the `self._path` is being reset to `_empty_path`, but the values presented do not indicate that. Additionally, the function lacks proper error handling in case `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Bug Cause
1. **Incorrect `self._path` value**: The `_recache` function should reset `self._path` to `_empty_path`, but the provided runtime values show that it is not happening.
2. **Undefined Error Handling**: If `_marker_function` is not defined, the function will throw an error when called.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `self._path` is correctly set to `_empty_path`.
2. Implement error handling to check if `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path if self._path is None else _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function() if callable(self._marker_function) else None
``` 

This corrected version takes care of resetting `self._path` to `_empty_path` when it is `None` and includes error handling for the case when `_marker_function` is not defined or callable.
