### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is being called when trying to set markers hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'` using a custom `markers.MarkerStyle` object with `ax.scatter()`. The issue is that the function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which leads to markers being filled even when `'none'` fill style is specified. This behavior contradicts the desired outcome.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by unconditionally setting `_filled = True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This results in markers being filled even when the intention is to have them hollow.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the `_recache` function to respect the desired `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle` is specified as `'none'`, then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that markers are correctly rendered as hollow when 'none' fill style is requested.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By incorporating the conditional check based on the `fillstyle` value, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when `'none'` fillstyle is specified in the `MarkerStyle` object.
