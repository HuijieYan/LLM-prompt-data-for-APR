The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of having hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is used. This causes the markers to be rendered as filled even when the user specifies hollow markers.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified by the user. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the fillstyle and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the markers will be rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not appearing hollow when using `fillstyle='none'` with `ax.scatter()`.
