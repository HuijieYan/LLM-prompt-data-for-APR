The bug in the `_recache` function is related to not properly updating the `self._path` and `self._filled` variables when the `_marker_function` is called. This leads to incorrect marker rendering behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue where the markers are not hollow when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_path` attribute is updated correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter and that the `filled` attribute is adjusted accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._path = _empty_path_maybe_hollow
        self._filled = False

    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_path` and `_filled` attributes based on the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function, the markers will behave as expected as demonstrated in the GitHub issue.
