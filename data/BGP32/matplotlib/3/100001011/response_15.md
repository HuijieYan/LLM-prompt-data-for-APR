The bug in the provided function `_recache()` is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without resetting the marker attributes correctly beforehand. This leads to incorrect marker rendering behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue where markers are not hollow even when setting `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to properly reset the marker attributes before calling `self._marker_function()`. Specifically, we need to set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in the MarkerStyle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Fix for setting markers to hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the markers will be correctly rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', addressing the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow as expected.
