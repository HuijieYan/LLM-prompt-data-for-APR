### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to update the marker attributes such as path, transform, snap_threshold, etc. However, based on the provided runtime values and types, the function seems to miss updating the `_path` attribute correctly. This discrepancy might lead to markers not appearing as expected, which aligns with the reported GitHub issue where markers are not hollow as intended.

### Identified issue:
The `_path` attribute is being set to `_empty_path` instead of being properly updated with the marker path.

### Cause of the bug:
When `_recache` is called, the `_path` attribute is set to `_empty_path`, causing the markers to appear incorrectly filled even when the `fillstyle='none'` is specified in the marker style.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the issue, ensure that the `_path` attribute is updated according to the specified marker style, allowing markers to be displayed correctly. 

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path, _ = self._marker_function()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
``` 

By updating the `_path` attribute with the correct marker path obtained from `_marker_function`, the corrected version of the function should address the issue with markers appearing incorrectly filled.
