### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is meant to reset certain attributes of the object. However, the `_marker_function` attribute is called without any checks leading to potential bugs.
2. The bug arises when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the markers are not rendered as hollow as expected.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check fillstyle to set filled attribute
        self._marker_function()
```

By adjusting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function should now render markers as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This fix should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub where markers were not displayed as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.
