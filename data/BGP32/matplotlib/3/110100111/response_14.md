Based on the buggy function and failing test provided, here is the analysis, explanation, and a corrected version of the function:

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes when called.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks the `fillstyle` attribute of a `MarkerStyle` instance.
3. The expected behavior is that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in the marker being hollow.

### Error Location:
The bug is in the line where `self._marker_function()` is called. This line should be responsible for setting the proper attributes for a hollow marker, but it seems to be missing or incorrectly implemented.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to verify that setting `fillstyle='none'` should make the marker hollow. However, the `MarkerStyle` class does not handle this properly, leading to the marker not being hollow as expected.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function `_marker_function` properly handles setting up the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. Implement the necessary logic within the `_recache` function to ensure that the marker is correctly configured based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected version of the function
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the function will now behave as intended. This change ensures that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker will be rendered as hollow.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
