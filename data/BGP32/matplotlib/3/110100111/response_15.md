### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the properties of the marker style. However, it has a bug where it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking its existence, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `fillstyle` of a marker style object with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`. The expected behavior is for the marker to be hollow (`'none'` fillstyle).
3. The bug causes the marker not to be hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is set, as reported in the GitHub issue. The `_recache` function does not properly handle the case where `_marker_function` is None and directly calls it.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Added check here
            self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not None, preventing unexpected behavior. This should resolve the issue where markers were not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was set.
