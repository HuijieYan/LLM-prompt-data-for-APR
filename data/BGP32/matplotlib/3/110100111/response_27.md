### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` function that initializes various attributes related to marker styling.
2. The issue is related to the marker not being hollow when a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` is used.
3. The bug lies in how `_marker_function` is called within `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or not in the `_recache` function. This leads to the marker not being set correctly as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. If `_marker_function` exists, call it to obtain the correct marker styling.
3. Add a condition to handle the case when `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check fillstyle for filled marker
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

Now, with this corrected version, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it exists, and it will consider the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not. This should address the issue with markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

Make sure to test the corrected function against the failing test case to verify the fix.
