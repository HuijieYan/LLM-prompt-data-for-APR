## Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache()` that is intended to recache certain attributes. The bug lies in the fact that `self._marker_function()` is called without checking if it exists or not, which can lead to errors.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `MarkerStyle` object is created with the `fillstyle='none'` parameter, but the markers still appear filled instead of hollow. This happens because the `_recache()` method does not properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case. The `_marker_function` is called without checking if it actually exists, leading to improper marker rendering.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache()` method to properly check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. Additionally, we need to handle the `fillstyle='none'` case to ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        fillstyle = self.get_fillstyle()
        if fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version of the `_recache()` method, the `fillstyle='none'` case will be properly handled, and the markers will appear as hollow when rendered.
