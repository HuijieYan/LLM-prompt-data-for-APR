To fix the buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to assign the correct function for `_marker_function` based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation of the bug and fix:
The bug was caused by not considering the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function. When the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the expectation is to have hollow markers, represented by `_filled` being `False`. This condition was missing in the original function.

To fix the bug, we added a check to set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This change ensures that the markers are correctly rendered as hollow when the specific fill style is requested.

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will now correctly handle different fill styles, including ensuring that markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
