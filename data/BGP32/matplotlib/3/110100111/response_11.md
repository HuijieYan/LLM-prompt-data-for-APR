## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is meant to reinitialize certain attributes when called.
2. The bug occurs in the line `self._marker_function()` which should be responsible for updating the marker style, but it is not properly defined in the provided code.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in the marker being rendered as hollow, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly define and implement the `_marker_function` method that updates the marker style according to the fillstyle chosen.

## Bug Cause
The bug stems from the fact that the `_marker_function` method is not correctly defined or implemented in the code. This method is responsible for updating the marker style based on the fillstyle chosen. Therefore, when the method is called without a valid implementation, it fails to properly update the marker style, causing the markers to not render correctly as hollow.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Define a proper `_marker_function` method that handles the updating of the marker style based on the fillstyle chosen.
2. Ensure that when `fillstyle='none'` is selected, the marker style is updated to render the markers as hollow.
3. Update the `_recache` method to correctly call the `_marker_function` method to update the marker style.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._update_marker_style()

    def _update_marker_style(self):
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
```

Now, with the updated `_update_marker_style` method, the marker style will correctly handle the case when `fillstyle='none'`, rendering the markers as hollow. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
