Based on the analysis of the buggy function, test code, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. 

By setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally, it overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting and results in filled markers instead of hollow ones as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly determine the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version should now correctly handle the situation where `fillstyle='none'`, resulting in hollow markers as expected.

This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`.
