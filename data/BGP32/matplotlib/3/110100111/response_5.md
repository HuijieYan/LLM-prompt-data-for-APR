### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is designed to recache various attributes when they are outdated or need to be reset. The function contains a conditional check on the `_marker_function`, which if not `None`, triggers a recalculation of marker attributes.

2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'` and then checks if `get_fillstyle()` returns `'none'` and `is_filled()` returns `False`.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The `_recache` function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Explanation of the bug

The current implementation of the `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to `'none'`. This leads to markers being filled despite the intention to have hollow markers, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that markers will be filled or hollow as intended based on the provided `fillstyle`.
