## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly handling the case when the `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. The function is setting various attributes of `MarkerStyle` class to default values even when the `_marker_function` is not `None`.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is designed to check if the `fillstyle` is set correctly and if the marker is considered filled based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a scenario where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in a hollow marker as expected.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not correctly handle the case when the `_marker_function` is not `None`. In the provided buggy code, the function unconditionally sets various attributes to default values regardless of the `_marker_function` being defined. This behavior leads to unexpected results, such as not achieving a hollow marker when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should only reset the attributes to default values if the `_marker_function` is `None`. If the `_marker_function` is defined, it should be invoked, assuming that it properly sets the attributes based on the marker function chosen.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the function will now correctly handle cases where the `_marker_function` is defined, allowing for customization of marker properties based on the marker function specified. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
