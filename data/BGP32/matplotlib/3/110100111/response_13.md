### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is called to recache marker properties. It sets various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `fillstyle` attribute when creating a custom marker style.
   
2. The bug likely lies in the handling of the `fillstyle` attribute within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes markers to not appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set in the `MarkerStyle`. This results in unexpected filled markers instead of the expected hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function. We should adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Adjusting filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the bug causing markers to not appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be fixed. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
