## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize the marker style attributes. However, the bug occurs when calling `self._marker_function()` which is meant to update the marker style based on the provided function. In this case, the `self._marker_function` attribute is likely not defined correctly or is not being used as intended.

## Bug Explanation
The bug causes the marker style not to be updated as expected, resulting in fill styles not being set correctly when using the `MarkerStyle` class. This leads to markers not appearing as hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `self._marker_function` attribute is properly defined and that it is called at the right place within the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Update marker style based on the function
        self._path, self._transform = self._marker_function()

        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
```

By correctly updating the `_path` and `_transform` attributes based on the provided function, we ensure that the marker style is correctly set according to the function behavior. This should address the issue and allow markers with `'none'` fill style to appear as hollow when rendered.
