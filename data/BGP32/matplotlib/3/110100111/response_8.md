### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to update the marker style attributes based on certain conditions. However, the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where it is trying to call a function without checking if it actually exists or is defined. This can cause a `TypeError` or `AttributeError` if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the line `self._marker_function()` being called without checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This leads to the function trying to be called even when it doesn't exist, causing issues during execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it to avoid errors.
2. Set the `fillstyle` attribute correctly based on the input provided while constructing the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self.fillstyle = 'full' if self._fillstyle == 'full' else 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the line `self.fillstyle = 'full' if self._fillstyle == 'full' else 'none'` to set the correct `fillstyle` attribute and checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, the bug should be resolved.
