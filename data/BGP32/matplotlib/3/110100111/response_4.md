## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reinitialize some internal variables. However, the issue lies in the assumption that `_marker_function` is always callable, leading to an uncalled function reference error.

### Error Location
- The error occurs when `_marker_function` is not set, leading to a potential function call on a `None` object.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function attempts to call `_marker_function` without ensuring that it is defined. This results in an AttributeError when the function is not set.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it to prevent errors.

## Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function in the MarkerStyle class
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for `self._marker_function is not None` before calling it, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined, preventing potential errors. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the desired behavior when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
