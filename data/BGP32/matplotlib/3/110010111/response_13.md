### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the issue where the markers are not being hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`.

### Error Location
The error is located in the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```
This line is supposed to be setting `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the marker to be rendered as filled even though the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is because the `_filled` attribute is hard-coded to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the intention of making the marker hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Fix: Set _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
