To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that the `is_filled()` function actually returns the opposite of what `get_fillstyle()` returns. Currently, the buggy function does not handle this correctly, resulting in the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled()` function correctly reflects whether the marker should be filled or not. This correction will pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior when setting `fillstyle='none'`.

With this fix, the corrected `MarkerStyle` class will now properly handle the filling of markers based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing users to create hollow markers as intended.
