### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain internal variables to default values and then call a marker function. However, the buggy function fails to properly reset the `_filled` attribute to `False`, which leads to incorrect behavior in the test case where a marker is expected to be unfilled.

### Error Location
The error lies in the line where `_filled` attribute is set to `True` instead of `False`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the marker to be filled when it should be empty, resulting in a failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` when resetting the `MarkerStyle`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fixed: Set _filled to False
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
