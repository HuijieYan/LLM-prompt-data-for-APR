To fix the bug in the provided function `_recache`, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the fillstyle parameter. Currently, the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` which causes the test case to fail when `is_filled()` is called.

Let's update the function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the MarkerStyle initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle parameter
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we have added a section to determine the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the fillstyle is `'full'`, then `_filled` is set to `True`, otherwise, it is set to `False`.

This update will ensure that the custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle set to `'none'` will correctly have `_filled` set to `False`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post and passing the failing test case.
