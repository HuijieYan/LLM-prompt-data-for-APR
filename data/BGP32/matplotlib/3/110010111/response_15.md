### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where the `_marker_function` is not `None`. The function is supposed to reset certain attributes but then call the `_marker_function`. However, based on the error message and the failing test, it seems like the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False` after setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Error Location
The issue lies in the way the attributes are being reset and then using the `_marker_function`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is not correctly resetting the attributes that impact the `is_filled` method. It seems like when the `_marker_function` is called, it might be affecting the `filled` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the attributes are properly reset before calling the `_marker_function`. Specifically, the `filled` attribute should be set to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` before calling the `_marker_function`. This should resolve the issue with markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
