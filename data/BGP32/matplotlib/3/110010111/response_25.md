### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is supposed to recache the marker properties, but the bug occurs when `_marker_function` is called.
2. The bug arises from calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists in the `MarkerStyle` class.
3. Due to the bug, the custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'` does not work as expected, leading to the failing test assertion.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.
5. We will update the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None` condition, we make sure that `_marker_function` is only called when it exists. This fix should address the issue with setting markers to be hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.
