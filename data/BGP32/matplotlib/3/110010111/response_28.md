### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes some variables and calls the `_marker_function` method. Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` incorrectly, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This indicates a bug in the `_recache` function where the `self._filled` variable is not properly set based on the `fillstyle`.

### Error Location
The bug is likely in the initialization of the `_filled` variable in the `_recache` function. 

### Bug Reason
The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the marker is intended to be hollow (`fillstyle='none'`). This contradicts the expected behavior and causes the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `self._filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` variable will be set based on the `fillstyle`. Now, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow as expected.
