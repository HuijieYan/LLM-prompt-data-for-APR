## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache certain internal variables. However, the issue arises from the incorrect assignment of `self._filled` in the function. The function is setting `self._filled` to `True` always, which causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False`.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the test case is checking whether the marker style is filled or not by using the `is_filled()` method. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function where `self._filled` is always set to `True`, the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. This mismatch in the expected and actual values leads to the assertion error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` is correctly updated based on the fillstyle of the marker. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then the marker should be considered as not filled (`self._filled = False`). This adjustment will align the behavior of the `is_filled()` method with the defined fillstyle.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` to `self._fillstyle != 'none'`, the corrected version of the function will correctly set the filled status based on the fillstyle provided. This change will ensure that the `is_filled()` method reflects the actual fill status of the marker style, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
