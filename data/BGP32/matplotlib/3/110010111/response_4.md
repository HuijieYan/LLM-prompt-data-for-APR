### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is meant to recache the marker attributes. The error occurs when the method `is_filled()` is called later on as a part of the failing test. The expected behavior is that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in a hollow marker. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when it should be hollow.

### Potential Error Locations
The bug likely originates from the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter value. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the marker is hollow.

### The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False  # Fix: Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False`, ensuring that the marker is hollow as expected when the `is_filled()` method is later called.
