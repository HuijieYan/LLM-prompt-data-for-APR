## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize different attributes based on the current state of the marker style object. However, the issue seems to be with the `self._filled` attribute not getting updated correctly, which leads to the failing test where the marker is expected to be not filled but it is filled instead.

## Bug Cause
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the actual `fillstyle` set for the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, even if `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy
We need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value according to the `fillstyle` set when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.
