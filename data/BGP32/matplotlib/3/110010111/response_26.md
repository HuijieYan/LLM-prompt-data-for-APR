## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to update certain attributes based on the current state. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` after setting the fillstyle to `'none'`, but the expected result is not being returned.

## Error Location
The issue seems to be with how the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function. This results in the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle being `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`. Now, when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, `_filled` will be False as expected. This change will make the `is_filled` method return the correct result, passing the failing test.
