Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, here is the explanation of the bug and the strategy for fixing it:

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly updating the values of `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. This results in the `is_filled()` method not behaving as expected during the test execution.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` in the `_recache` function, the corrected version ensures that the markers are filled or hollow based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. This will resolve the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
