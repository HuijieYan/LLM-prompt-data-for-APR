### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. It initializes several parameters based on the value of `_marker_function`. In the failing test, the issue arises when trying to check if the marker is filled or not after setting fillstyle to 'none'.
2. The potential error location is the line where `_marker_function()` is called without any condition to check if it exists or not.
3. The cause of the bug is that `_marker_function` is being called unconditionally, leading to unexpected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This results in the marker being filled instead of hollow as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`. Additionally, we may need to update the other internal variables based on the `fillstyle` parameter to ensure the correct marker appearance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. Update other internal variables in `_recache` based on the `fillstyle` parameter to correctly handle the behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` parameter and updating `_filled` accordingly, the corrected version ensures that the marker appears as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
