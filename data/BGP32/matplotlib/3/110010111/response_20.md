### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for updating various attributes related to the marker style. In the failing test, the issue arises when the `is_filled` method is called, indicating that the `filled` attribute is not being set correctly to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker should be hollow. However, due to the bug, the `filled` attribute is not being set correctly, leading to a filled marker instead of a hollow one.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the `filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is not being set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This results in the marker not being hollow when it should be.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function. We can directly check if `fillstyle` is `'none'` and set the `filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check fillstyle and set filled attribute accordingly
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version should now ensure that the marker is hollow when `fillstyle='none'` as expected.
