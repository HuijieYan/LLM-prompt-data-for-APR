### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to default values, with the exception of `_marker_function`, which triggers a specific marker function. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `_filled` attribute. The failing test is checking if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, which is not happening.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter when `_recache` is called. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method behaves correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function, the corrected version ensures that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
