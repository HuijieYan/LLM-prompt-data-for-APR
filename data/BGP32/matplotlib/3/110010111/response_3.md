### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the issue. The function is supposed to reset certain attributes within the class, but it incorrectly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to determine if the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled` method.

The error message indicates that the issue arises from `marker_style.is_filled()` returning `True` unexpectedly, which is not the desired behavior based on the `fillstyle`. This suggests that the current implementation of the `MarkerStyle` class does not handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the improper implementation of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. When `self._marker_function` is not `None` but is called anyway, it can lead to unexpected behavior in other methods of the class, such as `is_filled`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` method properly handles the case where `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This can be done by adding a condition to check the existence of `self._marker_function` before calling it. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
```

By updating the `_recache` method as shown above, we ensure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the `fillstyle`. This change should resolve the issue with markers not appearing hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
