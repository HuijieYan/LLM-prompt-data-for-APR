To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method actually returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Currently, the function always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, `_filled` will be set to `True`, indicating that the marker should be filled. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` will be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

This correction ensures that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

By applying this correction, the issue reported on GitHub related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved, and the failing test provided should pass successfully.
