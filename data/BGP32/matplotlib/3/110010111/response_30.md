### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache marker information based on the marker function. However, in this case, it's encountering an issue related to the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value.
   
2. The potential error location is within the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the `is_filled` method is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the failing assertion where `marker_style.is_filled()` is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

### The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle='full'):
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'
    
    # Fix the is_filled method to handle 'none' fillstyle correctly
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By ensuring that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle the case of hollow markers with `fillstyle='none'` correctly.
