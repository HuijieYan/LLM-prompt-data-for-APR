## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function initializes various class attributes and calls the `_marker_function` method.
3. The bug here seems to be that `_marker_function` is being called without being properly defined or checked.
4. To fix the bug, we need to define `_marker_function` or add a check to ensure it exists before calling it.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is None` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is checked for existence. Additionally, I set the default value for `_snap_threshold` to `float('inf')` and `_filled` to `False` as per the expected values.
