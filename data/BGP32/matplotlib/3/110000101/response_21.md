The bug in the `_recache()` function is that it calls a potentially undefined `_marker_function()` without checking if it actually exists. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined in the `MarkerStyle` class.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version ensures that `_marker_function` is checked before calling it to prevent any potential errors.
