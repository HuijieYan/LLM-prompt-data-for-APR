## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset several attributes to their default values and then call a marker function. However, there is a missing condition check to handle the scenario where the `self._marker_function` attribute is `None`. This could lead to an AttributeError since the function will be called without being properly set.

## Bug
The bug occurs when the `_recache` function is called and `self._marker_function` is `None`. The buggy function does not check for this possibility before attempting to call the function, resulting in an AttributeError.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, the function should simply return without attempting to call it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None  # Setting path to default value
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()  # Setting transform to default value
        self._alt_path = None  # Setting alt_path to None
        self._alt_transform = None  # Setting alt_transform to None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Setting snap_threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'  # Setting joinstyle to 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'  # Setting capstyle to 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Setting filled to False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check `self._marker_function` before calling it and setting the default values as expected, we ensure that the function operates correctly even when `self._marker_function` is `None`.
