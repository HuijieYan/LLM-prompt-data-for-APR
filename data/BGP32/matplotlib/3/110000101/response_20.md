## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is missing the implementation of setting the `self._marker_function` which is used to recache the marker style properties. The function currently checks if `self._marker_function` is `None` and only returns if it is. However, it should actually call the `_marker_function` method to recache the properties.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is not properly recaching the marker style properties when `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This results in the properties not being updated correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when using the marker style.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `_marker_function` method within the `_recache` function to recache the marker style properties properly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the line `self._marker_function()` within the `if` statement, the corrected function will properly recache the marker style properties when `self._marker_function` is not `None`.
