Based on the expected values and types provided, the bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is defined or not. This is causing an error when trying to call a function that might not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Using float('inf') to represent infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, preventing any errors related to calling an undefined function.
