### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes certain attributes to specific values and then calls a marker function. The issue lies with the assumption that the `self._marker_function` is not `None`. If it is `None`, the function should not proceed to call the marker function.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `self._marker_function` is `None`, but the function still attempts to call it. This results in a `TypeError` since trying to call `None` as a function is not allowed.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, we can simply return without proceeding further.

### Corrected code
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
