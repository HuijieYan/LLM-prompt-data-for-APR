Based on the provided buggy function and expected input/output values, the bug arises from the fact that the `_marker_function` is called without any checks or assignments before it. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or set correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that before calling `_marker_function`, we have a valid check if it is not `None` and possibly provide a default behavior or raise an error if it is not properly set.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        
        # Add a check for _marker_function before calling it
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Handle the case when _marker_function is not properly set
            raise ValueError("_marker_function is not callable")
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. If it is not set correctly, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate the issue. This fix should ensure the function behaves correctly based on the expected input/output values provided.
