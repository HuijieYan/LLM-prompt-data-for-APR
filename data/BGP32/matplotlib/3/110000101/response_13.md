The bug in the provided function is that it tries to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it's defined or not. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined. This prevents any potential `TypeError` that might occur when `_marker_function` is not defined.
