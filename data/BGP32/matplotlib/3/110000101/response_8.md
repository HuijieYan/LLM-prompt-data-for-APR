### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes several instance variables but doesn't actually assign a value to `self._marker_function` before calling it. This leads to a `NoneType` object error when trying to call `self._marker_function()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` is properly defined before calling it. We can check if it is not `None` before making the call.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. The other variable assignments remain unchanged.
