The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()` that is called without checking if it exists, resulting in a potential AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined. This error causes the function to break and potentially crash.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. We can add a simple if condition to check if it is not None before invoking it. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined, preventing any potential errors.
