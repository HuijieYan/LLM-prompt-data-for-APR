### Analysis
The `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there is a logical error in the code where it checks if `_marker_function` is `None` and skips the reset process if that condition is met.

### Bug
The bug in the code is that the `_marker_function` is being called even when it is `None`, which can cause unexpected behavior or errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to only call the `_marker_function` when it is not `None`.

### The corrected code
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed condition to only call _marker_function if it is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap_threshold to infinity
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```
