The bug in the provided function `_recache` lies in the unnecessary invocation of `self._marker_function()` without checking its availability. This could potentially lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not properly defined or inappropriately set in the class.

To fix the bug, we should add a conditional check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent any unintended errors caused by invoking a non-existent or inappropriate function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that the function is only executed if it is defined. This update aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
