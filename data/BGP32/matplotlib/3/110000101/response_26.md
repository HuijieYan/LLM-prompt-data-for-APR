The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually defined. This can cause an error when `_marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version checks if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it, preventing any potential errors.
