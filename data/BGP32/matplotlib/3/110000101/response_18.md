### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values, then calls a `_marker_function`.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect assignment of the `_filled` attribute.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrect assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `True` instead of `False`.

### Cause of the bug using the buggy function
The bug causes the `_filled` attribute to always be set as `True`, regardless of the intended value. This deviates from the expected behavior, leading to incorrect attribute values in the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
Update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method to set it to `False` as intended.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Correcting the assignment to set _filled as False
    self._marker_function()
```
