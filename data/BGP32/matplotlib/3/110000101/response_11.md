The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check before calling `_marker_function`. If `_marker_function` is `None`, we should simply return without performing any other operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version will check if `_marker_function` is `None` before proceeding with the rest of the operations, preventing any potential `TypeError` that could occur.
