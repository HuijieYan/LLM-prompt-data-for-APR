### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there is an issue with the conditional check on `self._marker_function`, which might be causing the bug.

### Potential Error
The potential error lies in the condition `if self._marker_function is None`, which should be `if self._marker_function is not None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check. As it is currently written, the function will only execute the reset logic if `self._marker_function` is actually `None`, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This way, the reset logic will only execute when the marker function is defined.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fix: Changed condition to check if not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
