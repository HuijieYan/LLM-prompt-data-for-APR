## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` function that initializes several attributes and then calls the `_marker_function`. 
2. The bug in the function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it exists or not which might lead to an AttributeError if the function is not defined.
3. The expected input values for `self._fillstyle` are not mentioned explicitly but seem to have no direct impact on the rest of the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before calling it.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Fixing the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding a check to verify the existence of `_marker_function`, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined, preventing any potential AttributeError.
