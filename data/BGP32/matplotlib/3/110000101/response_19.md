The bug in the `_recache` function is that when calling `self._marker_function()`, it is not assigning the returned values to the appropriate variables. This results in the variables not being properly updated according to the marker function.

To fix the bug, we need to capture the values returned by `self._marker_function()` and assign them to the corresponding variables within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path, self._transform, self._alt_path, self._alt_transform, self._snap_threshold, self._joinstyle, self._capstyle, self._filled = self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will properly update all the relevant variables according to the marker function's output.
