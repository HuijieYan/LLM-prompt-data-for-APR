### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of a marker style but fails to correctly utilize the `fillstyle` attribute, which is crucial for setting markers as hollow. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to verify whether the `fillstyle` attribute is correctly set to `'none'` and the marker is identified as not filled.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Setting `self._filled = True` instead of using the `fillstyle` attribute.
2. The call to `self._marker_function()`. 

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the improper initialization of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function. Due to setting `self._filled = True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` value, the markers will always be filled.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use the `fillstyle` attribute in setting the `self._filled` variable.
2. Ensure the correct handling of the `self._marker_function()` call if it is essential for marker initialization.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the assignment of `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected function ensures that markers will be filled or hollow based on the specified `fillstyle`. This modification aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding hollow markers not being displayed correctly.
