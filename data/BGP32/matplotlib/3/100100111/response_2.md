### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values if `_marker_function` is not None and then call `_marker_function`. However, the problem arises from incorrectly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` of a `MarkerStyle` object is `'none'` and if it is not filled. Currently, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `is_filled` method will return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This results in the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` objects returning `True` even if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying the fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass as expected.
