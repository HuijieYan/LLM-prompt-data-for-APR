## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset some internal variables and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is called without any consideration of the `fillstyle` parameter which is responsible for setting the marker as hollow or filled. This leads to incorrect markers being rendered when trying to set them as hollow.

## Bug Explanation
- The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file resets various internal variables but does not handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly.
- In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, a `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`. The `get_fillstyle` method is used to retrieve the fillstyle, and the `is_filled` method is used to check if the marker is filled. Both checks are failing when the marker should be hollow.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, you need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `self._filled` variable accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is hollow.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version of the `_recache` function, the `fillstyle` parameter is considered when setting the `_filled` variable, ensuring that markers can be rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
