## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_recache` sets various attributes to default values and then calls a marker function if it exists. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tests the behavior of `MarkerStyle` with the fillstyle parameter set to `'none'`.

The expected input value for the test is `'none'`, and it should return `False` when checked with `is_filled()`. This is expected behavior since `'none'` fillstyle means the marker should not be filled.

The GitHub issue reports that when using `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` in a scatter plot, the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Identifying potential error locations
1. The function sets `_filled` to `True` by default, which might be incorrect when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The `_marker_function` being called might not be handling the case of `fillstyle='none'` markers correctly.
3. The `_transform` may not be correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug might be caused by the default value of `_filled` being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This can lead to markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

Additionally, the `_marker_function` being called might not handle the case of `'none'` fillstyle markers correctly, leading to markers still being filled.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function` handles the case of `fillstyle='none'` markers correctly.
3. Review the marker functionality to make sure it respects the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This change ensures that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

Make sure to test this corrected version with the failing `test_marker_fillstyle` and verify that it now passes and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
