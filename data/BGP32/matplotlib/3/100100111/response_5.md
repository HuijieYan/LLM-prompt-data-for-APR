## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset several attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there is an issue where the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the test expects the marker's `fillstyle` to be `'none'` and that the marker is not filled. However, when the `_recache` function is called, it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, resulting in a filled marker regardless of the `fillstyle`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` follows the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` constructor. We can achieve this by checking the `fillstyle` inside the `_recache` function and updating `self._filled` accordingly.

## The corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Check the fillstyle to determine if the marker should be filled
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function ensures that the marker is correctly filled or empty as desired.
