## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache(self)` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`, but it has a bug related to setting the `self._filled` attribute. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` checks whether the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly set to `'none'` and the marker is not filled. The expected values for the attributes right before the return of the function need to be updated for the test to pass. The GitHub issue also confirms that the fillstyle behavior is not as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache(self)` function. Due to this, the `is_filled()` method fails the test even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to match the behavior related to the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated to set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the `fillstyle` parameter, and the test `test_marker_fillstyle()` should pass successfully.
