## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to update certain attributes of the MarkerStyle class based on the provided marker function. However, there seems to be a mistake in setting the `fillstyle` property. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `fillstyle='none'`, markers are not hollow as expected. This suggests that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Setting `_filled` to `True` by default might be causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The `_marker_function()` might not be properly updating the `fillstyle` attribute.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to True by default and not being updated correctly. This results in markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly updates all relevant attributes including `fillstyle`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected function ensures that markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
