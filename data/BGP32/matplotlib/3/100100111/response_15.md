## Analysis
The `_recache` function aims to reset certain attributes of a marker style object but fails to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. In the provided test case, the `fillstyle` is expected to be `'none'` before the `_recache` function is called. Additionally, specific attributes such as `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` need to be set to expected values during the function execution.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` attribute, leading to markers not being hollow when set to `'none'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug appears to stem from the `_recache` function not considering the `fillstyle` attribute during the resetting process. This omission causes the markers to not properly reflect the desired 'none' fillstyle.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should include a step to set the correct value for the `fillstyle` attribute during the reset process. This adjustment should ensure the markers behave as expected when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = np.inf
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `fillstyle` attribute is checked, and if it is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is explicitly set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow when this style is selected. This adjustment addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and aligns with the expected behavior of the marker style object.
