## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function resets several attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The issue lies in the assumption that setting `self._filled = False` will make the marker hollow, which is incorrect.
2. The bug is caused by setting `self._filled = True` by default, making the markers appear filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
3. The failing test expects the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, but due to the default value of `self._filled`, the marker remains filled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of determining the fill status of the marker based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
5. Corrected code is provided below.

## Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the logic to set `self._filled` based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function will now correctly render the marker as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
