### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets various attributes of a MarkerStyle object, but the assertion in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the `is_filled()` method to return `False` when the `fillstyle` attribute is set to `'none'`.
2. The bug likely lies in how the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache` function.
3. The bug is causing the `is_filled()` method of MarkerStyle to return `True` instead of `False`, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to create a marker with a `'none'` fill style.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the `_filled` attribute is properly set based on the `fillstyle` attribute.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = Affine2D()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, and the marker with a `'none'` fill style should appear hollow as expected.
