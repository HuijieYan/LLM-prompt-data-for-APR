The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the initialization of the `_filled` attribute. It should be set to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in order to have hollow markers.

Explanation of the bug:
The `_recache` function initializes the attributes of MarkerStyle objects. When `fillstyle='none'`, the expected behavior is to have hollow markers. However, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default. This causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow, irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
