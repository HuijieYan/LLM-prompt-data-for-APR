## Analysis
The `_recache` function is called when a MarkerStyle object is initialized to reset its attributes to default values. In the provided buggy function, the `_marker_function` is called without first checking if it is `None`. This could lead to a `NoneType` object being called as a function, causing an error.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` verifies the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` object when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. The expected behavior is that the marker should not be filled.

Based on the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, the `_recache` function should set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the `_recache` function calling `self._marker_function()` without verifying if `self._marker_function` is `None`. This causes an error if `self._marker_function` is not defined. In the failing test, the expected behavior is that the marker should not be filled when `fillstyle` is set to `'none', but the current implementation does not ensure this.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it and setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the function handles the expected behavior correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
