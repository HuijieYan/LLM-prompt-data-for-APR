The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is supposed to set `_filled` to `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but it is not currently implemented. This causes the marker to still be displayed as filled instead of hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function with the corrected `_filled` assignment, the MarkerStyle with `fillstyle='none'` will correctly render the markers as hollow when used with `ax.scatter()`.

This correction addresses the issue raised on the GitHub platform where the user expected to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'` but was not able to achieve the desired outcome.
