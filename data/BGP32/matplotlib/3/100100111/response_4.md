### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is intended to reset certain attributes when they are needed. However, the bug in the function prevents the `fillstyle` attribute from being correctly set to `'none'`. This bug is causing markers to not appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The bug is likely occurring in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. As per the test case, when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should be hollow, but the current implementation does not handle this properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute. When `fillstyle='none'`, the attribute should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. However, in the current implementation, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to correctly reflect the desired behavior when `fillstyle='none'`. By setting `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, we can ensure that markers appear hollow when the fill style is specified as 'none'.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version of the `_recache` function, we add a conditional check to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', `_filled` is set to `False`, ensuring that markers appear hollow when specified. This correction addresses the bug and aligns the behavior with the expected outcome specified by the failing test and the GitHub issue.
