## Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` in class `MarkerStyle` is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes.
2. The bug is due to a potential mistake in how the `_marker_function()` is being called when checking if it is `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `if self._marker_function is None`, which should be instead `if self._marker_function is not None`. This condition is incorrect and prevents the `_marker_function` from being called when it should.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Change the condition `if self._marker_function is None` to `if self._marker_function is not None` so that the `_marker_function` is called when it exists.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly call `_marker_function()` when it is not `None`. This correction should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
