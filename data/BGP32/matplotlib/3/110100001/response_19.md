## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache certain attributes, including `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, `_filled`, and call the `_marker_function`.
- The issue arises due to the `if` condition checking if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it, which can lead to the function not being executed as intended.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is not being called properly due to the check if it is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Remove the `if self._marker_function is None:` condition to ensure that the `_marker_function` is always called during the recaching process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By removing the `if self._marker_function is None:` condition, the corrected version ensures that the `_marker_function` is always called during the recaching process, fixing the bug in the `_recache` function.
