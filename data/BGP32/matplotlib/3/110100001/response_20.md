### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method which is responsible for resetting certain attributes when invoked. 
2. The `_marker_function` attribute is expected to be a function that performs some specific task, but the code does not handle it properly.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a specified `marker` and `fillstyle`, then checks if the `fillstyle` attribute is set correctly and if the marker is filled or not.
4. The bug seems to stem from calling `_marker_function` without consideration of its purpose, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code blindly calls the `_marker_function` without checking its existence or purpose. This can cause issues when the `_marker_function` is not set correctly or not needed in the specific context.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is valid and serves a specific purpose. If it is not needed or not set, then it should be handled gracefully to prevent any issues caused by its invocation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By checking the existence of `_marker_function` before calling it, we ensure that it is only invoked when actually intended. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
