## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the class instance based on the marker function being used.
2. The bug occurs when `self._marker_function` is checked for `None`, but there is no logic to actually call this function if it exists, causing the attributes not to be updated properly.

## Error Location:
The bug lies in the condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None`, but there is no execution of this function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because even if `self._marker_function` exists, it is not being called to actually update the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to add the logic to call the `_marker_function` if it is not `None` so that the attributes can be updated properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle(): 
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

After applying this fix, the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
