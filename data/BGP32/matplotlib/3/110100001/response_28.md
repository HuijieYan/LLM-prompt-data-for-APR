The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually defined. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not set properly.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should now properly handle the case where `_marker_function` is not defined, avoiding potential errors.
