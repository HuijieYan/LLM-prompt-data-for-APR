## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to reset certain attributes and then call the `_marker_function`, however, there is a potential bug in this function that could cause it to fail.
- The bug lies in the `if` condition where it checks if `_marker_function` is `None`. If this condition is true, the function returns without resetting the attributes or calling `_marker_function`, which could be problematic.
- In the failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle`, it creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects `get_fillstyle()` to return 'none' and `is_filled()` to return `False`.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_recache` function is that it checks if `_marker_function` is `None` and returns early without resetting the attributes or calling `_marker_function`. This would lead to unexpected behavior when creating a `MarkerStyle` object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that even if `_marker_function` is `None`, the attributes are still reset before returning. This will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object is properly initialized regardless of the `_marker_function`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By making the above corrections to the `_recache` function, it should now properly reset the attributes even if `_marker_function` is `None`. This will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object is correctly initialized, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass with the corrected version.
