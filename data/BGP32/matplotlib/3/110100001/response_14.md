### Analysis:
- The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` method that is used to update the marker style attributes.
- The bug lies in the `_recache` method where it tries to call a function stored in `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not.
- This bug causes an error when trying to call `self._marker_function()` when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the case where `self._marker_function` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to call a `None` object.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

After applying this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should function correctly without raising an error in the provided failing test.

This corrected version handles the case where `self._marker_function` is `None` by adding an additional check before calling the function.
