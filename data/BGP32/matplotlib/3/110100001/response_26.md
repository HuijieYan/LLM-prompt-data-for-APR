The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is actually set. This can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `self._marker_function` is not initialized properly.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, preventing any potential errors associated with calling a `NoneType` object. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
