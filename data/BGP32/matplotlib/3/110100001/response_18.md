### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to properly handle the case where `_marker_function` is `None`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call `self._marker_function()`.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the line `self._marker_function()` where it assumes that `_marker_function` is always callable without checking if it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` is checked, but then the code proceeds to call `self._marker_function()` without handling the case where `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, just return from the function without executing any further operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache()` function will now properly handle the case where `_marker_function` is `None` and return without attempting to call it. This fix will prevent the AttributeError and help the test function `test_marker_fillstyle()` to pass successfully.
