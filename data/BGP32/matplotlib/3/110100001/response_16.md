### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to an error when `_marker_function` is None or not defined.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is in the line where `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is None or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code doesn't check if `_marker_function` is defined before trying to call it. If `_marker_function` is None or not defined, it will lead to an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None: # Added a check to see if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()

```

By adding the check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, the corrected function will prevent any errors that could occur due to calling an undefined function.
