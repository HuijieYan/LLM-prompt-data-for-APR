The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to correctly set the attributes `_filled` and `_marker_function` in certain cases. 

The bug occurs because the function checks if `_marker_function` is `None` before setting the attributes, which means that in cases where `_marker_function` is not `None`, the attributes may not get set correctly.

To fix this bug, we can reorder the statements in the function to first set the attributes and then call `_marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly set the attributes regardless of the value of `_marker_function`. This should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
