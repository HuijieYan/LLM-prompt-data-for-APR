### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not handling the case when `_marker_function` is not `None` properly.
2. The buggy function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by `_filled` being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This leads to incorrect results when checking if the marker is filled.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the case when `_marker_function` is not `None`, and correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
