### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes but calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it's defined. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not set in the instance.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if the `get_fillstyle()` method returns 'none' and if `is_filled()` returns False. This test fails due to the bug in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is not always set in the `MarkerStyle` instances, leading to a potential AttributeError when trying to call it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Ensure that `_marker_function` exists in the instance before calling it in the `_recache` function. Add a check to avoid calling `_marker_function` if it's not defined.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_recache` function checks if `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. This fix ensures that the function only gets executed if it's defined in the instance.
