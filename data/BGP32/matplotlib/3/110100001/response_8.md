## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker properties. However, there is a bug in the function where it is trying to call `_marker_function` without first checking if it is not `None`.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking the `fillstyle` of a `MarkerStyle` object with marker type 'o' and fillstyle 'none'. The bug causes the function to fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function blindly calling `_marker_function` without checking if it is `None`, causing an error.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```
