## Analysis:
1. The `_recache()` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to recache the marker style attributes.
2. The issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where a method is called without checking if it exists or not.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` is testing the `fillstyle` attribute, but due to the bug in the `_recache()` function, the test fails.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without verifying if it's set to a valid function or not. This results in a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists and is a callable function before calling it. If it's not defined or not callable, we should handle it gracefully.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making the above changes, the `MarkerStyle` class should now recache the attributes correctly and pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`.
