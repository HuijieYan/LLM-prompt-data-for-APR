## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is missing a check for the existence of the `_marker_function`.
2. This function is supposed to reinitialize various attributes related to the MarkerStyle instance, but it may fail if `_marker_function` is not defined.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if it returns 'none' as the fill style. Since `_recache` is not handling the case where `_marker_function` is not defined, it causes an error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `_recache` function to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. If `_marker_function` is `None`, return from the function without executing further code. This will prevent potential errors when `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With the added check for `_marker_function`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now handle cases where `_marker_function` is not defined and prevent any potential errors. This fix should help the failing test to pass successfully.
