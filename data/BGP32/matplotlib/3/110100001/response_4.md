## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to their default values before calling the `_marker_function`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_marker_function` not being defined or implemented properly, causing the function to crash when trying to call it.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it has been defined or set to a valid function. Since `_marker_function` is not initialized, it results in a `NoneType` object and causes the function to crash.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `_marker_function` is properly defined or set before trying to call it in the `_recache` function. This can be achieved by checking if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it is defined. This correction should prevent the function from crashing when `_marker_function` is not properly set.
