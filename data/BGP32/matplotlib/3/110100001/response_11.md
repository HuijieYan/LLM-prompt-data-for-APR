### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update the marker style attributes based on a marker function.
2. The bug seems to be in the line where the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or not.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` attribute of `MarkerStyle` is correctly set to 'none' when initialized with `marker='o', fillstyle='none'`. This test fails due to the bug in the `_recache` function not properly setting the attributes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is checked for existence before calling it inside the `_recache` method.

### Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists, preventing any potential errors. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
