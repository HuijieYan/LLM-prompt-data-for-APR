The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case when `_marker_function` is not None. It is missing the necessary logic to execute the `_marker_function` and assign the results to the appropriate attributes.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is not being called to update the marker style attributes, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing those attributes later.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called and its results are used to update the marker style attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path, self._transform = self._marker_function()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By using the `_marker_function()` to update the `_path` and `_transform` attributes in the corrected version, the function will now correctly update the marker style attributes based on the provided function. This should resolve the bug and make the test pass.
