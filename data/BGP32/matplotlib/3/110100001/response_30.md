## Analysis:
- The `_recache()` function in the class `MarkerStyle` is supposed to recalculate certain attributes when called.
- The bug in this function is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which might lead to an error if `self._marker_function` is not defined.

## Identification of Error:
- The bug is caused by the direct call to `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is defined.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug causes the function to try and execute `self._marker_function()` even if it's not assigned, resulting in a potential AttributeError.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
- We need to make sure that `self._marker_function` is defined before calling it in the `_recache()` function.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `_recache()` function will check if `self._marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it. This will prevent the potential AttributeError that could occur due to the buggy behavior.
