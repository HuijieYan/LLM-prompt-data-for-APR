## Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the class instance. However, there is a logical issue in the function where it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually assigned a value. This can lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

## Error Location:
The buggy part of the function is the line `self._marker_function()`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function tries to call `_marker_function` without checking if it's been assigned a valid function. This can cause a runtime error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Before calling `self._marker_function()`, we should first check if it is not `None`. If it is `None`, we should not attempt to call it. This will prevent the function from trying to call a `NoneType` object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is None:` check before calling `self._marker_function()`, the bug can be fixed. This change ensures that the function is only called if `self._marker_function` has been properly initialized.
