The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined, which leads to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
2. Change the function call to `_marker_function()` to `_marker_function(self)` to pass the instance of the class to the method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function(self)
```

By making these changes, the `_recache` function will now check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, avoiding the error.
