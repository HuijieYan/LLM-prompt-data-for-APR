## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update the attributes based on the marker function, but it seems like the marker function is not being called correctly.
2. The `_marker_function` attribute is called without checking if it exists and is a callable function.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker's fillstyle is set correctly, which is related to the `_filled` attribute that is not being updated in the `_recache` function.

## Bug Description:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly calling the `_marker_function` attribute. Additionally, the `_filled` attribute is not being updated based on the fillstyle provided in the marker style.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `_marker_function` attribute exists and if it is callable before calling it.
2. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided in the marker style.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists and is callable, and the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the fillstyle provided in the marker style.
