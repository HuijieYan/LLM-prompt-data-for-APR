### Analysis
The `_recache` function is called when initializing a `MarkerStyle` object and sets various attributes such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_filled`, etc. In the failing test, the issue arises when checking if the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled` method. The failing assertion implies that the marker is considered filled when it should be hollow (`fillstyle='none'`). The problem lies in the `_filled` attribute not being properly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Bug Explanation
- The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function.
- When a custom `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` attribute is not updated accordingly, leading to incorrect results in `is_filled`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To resolve the bug, update the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle` parameter to reflect whether the marker should be considered filled or hollow.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter received by the `MarkerStyle`, ensuring that the marker's fill status is accurately reflected. This modification will address the issue reported and make the `is_filled` method consistent with the specified `fillstyle`.
