### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is called when the `MarkerStyle` class is instantiated and is intended to set initial values for various attributes. The issue arises from the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the behavior expected when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The failing test is checking whether the marker style is filled by calling the `is_filled` method, which returns the `_filled` attribute's value. In this case, it's expected to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, but it's returning `True`.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This leads to the incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly based on the `fillstyle` value.
5. I will provide an updated version of the `_recache` function below.

### Updated `_recache` Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this updated `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle=='none'`, `_filled` will be `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior. This modification will resolve the issue of markers not being hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
