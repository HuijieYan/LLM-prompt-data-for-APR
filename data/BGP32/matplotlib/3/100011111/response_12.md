Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Potential Error Location:
The line causing the issue is:
```python
self._filled = True
```

### Explanation of the Bug:
- In the failing test, the `marker_style` is created with `fillstyle='none'`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.
- However, the `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`, meaning the marker will be filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.
- This is causing the test to fail because `_filled` should be set based on the `fillstyle` value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value provided in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute assignment based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function will ensure that markers are correctly filled or hollow as expected, resolving the failing test case and the corresponding GitHub issue.
