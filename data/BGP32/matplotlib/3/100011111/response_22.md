### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the marker's properties but doesn't consider the `fillstyle` property. The failing test indicates that the marker is not considered hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This bug is consistent with the GitHub issue where setting `fillstyle='none'` doesn't produce the expected hollow markers.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug lies in the `_recache` function not handling the `fillstyle` property. As a result, the filled property remains `True`, causing the markers not to appear hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the `fillstyle` property within the `_recache` function. If `fillstyle='none'`, we should set the `_filled` property to `False` to make the markers hollow.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the `fillstyle` property and setting the `_filled` property accordingly, the corrected version ensures that markers appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub.
