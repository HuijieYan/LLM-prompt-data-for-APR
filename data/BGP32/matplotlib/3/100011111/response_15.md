### Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes to their default values. In the failing test, it seems that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, indicating that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly reset.
2. From the runtime values and types of variables, we can see that the `_filled` attribute remains as `True` which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True`.
3. The expected behavior is that after the `_recache` function is called, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker is not filled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Fixed to set the filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly reset to `False` when the `_recache` function is called, ensuring that the markers are not filled as expected.
