### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes and calls a marker function. The failing test asserts that the marker is not filled, but due to a bug, it always returns `True`. This mismatch causes the AssertionError.

The relevant variables at the function's return (`_filled`) have an incorrect value of `True`, which should be `False` according to the expected values.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the function, leading to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to the correct value based on the fillstyle parameter provided to the `MarkerStyle` object. Update the `_recache` function to reflect this change.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should pass the failing test and ensure the expected behavior.
