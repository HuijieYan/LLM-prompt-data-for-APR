### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of `MarkerStyle` but fails to update the `_filled` attribute correctly.
2. In the failing test, the expected behavior is for the marker to be filled with `'none'` fillstyle, indicating that `_filled` should be `False`.
3. The failing test checks the result using `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`, which checks if `_filled` is `False`.
4. The bug causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` because `_filled` is not updated as expected in the `_recache` function.
5. To resolve the bug, update the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in the `_recache` function.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function will behave as expected and pass the failing test.
