### Analysis
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` is checking whether the `MarkerStyle` object is filled or not. The test creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects it to not be filled, i.e., `is_filled()` should return `False`. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where `fillstyle='none'` correctly, leading to the failure of this test.

From the runtime values, we can see that `self._filled` is set to `True` initially, which is incorrect because when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker style should not be filled. This is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` object in the `_recache()` function. As a result, even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker is filled, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should not be filled.

### Updated Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function will handle the case when the marker is supposed to be hollow correctly. Now, the test `test_marker_fillstyle()` should pass as expected.
