### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the actual fill style set by the user.
2. The failing test case expects the `is_filled` method to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, which indicates the markers should be hollow.
3. The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with the failing test case, where the markers are not hollow as expected when using `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `_recache` function always setting `_filled` to `True`, leading to markers not appearing hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style specified, we ensure that the markers will correctly appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
