## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class based on the `_marker_function` attribute. However, the function currently does not handle all the attributes correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when using certain settings like `fillstyle='none'`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The function does not properly reset the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. The `self._marker_function` is called without considering its effects on all relevant attributes.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely stems from the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter's value. This causes markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`, which is contrary to the user's expectation in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way in which the `filled` attribute is handled based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, the `_marker_function()` should be called after setting all attributes to ensure consistency.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures consistency in the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class.
