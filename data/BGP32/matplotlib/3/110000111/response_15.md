## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class, which is intended to reset certain attributes within the class.
2. The function should reinitialize `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes.
3. The bug arises in setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which conflicts with the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the assignment of `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.
5. The correction should set `_filled` to `False` when `self._fillstyle == 'none'`, and to `True` otherwise.

## Correction:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the assignment of `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we resolve the bug that caused the markers not to be hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` was set. This correction aligns the behavior with the expected result as described in the GitHub issue.
