## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The function `_recache` is intended to reinitialize certain variables based on their initial values. In the current implementation, the function calls `self._marker_function()` without resetting the variables before the call. This may cause unexpected behavior and result in issues like markers not appearing hollow as expected.
   
2. To fix the bug, ensure that all relevant variables are properly reset to their initial values before calling `self._marker_function()`. This will prevent any residual state from affecting the desired marker style.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version:
- Set `_filled` to `False` instead of `True` to ensure the markers are hollow.
- Set `_snap_threshold` to `float('inf')` to represent infinity.
- Restore the default initial values for other variables such as `_joinstyle` and `_capstyle`.
- Ensure that the function returns correct hollow markers as expected in the GitHub issue.
