To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly executed to recache the marker style. Currently, the `_marker_function` is being called without any conditional checks in place.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = None  # Initialize _path with None, expecting it to be updated by _marker_function
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Initialize snap_threshold with infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False

        # Call the _marker_function to update the marker style attributes
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation of changes made:
1. Initialized `_path` with `None` instead of `_empty_path`.
2. Initialized `_snap_threshold` with `float('inf')` to represent infinity.
3. Set `_filled` to `False` instead of `True`.

By making these changes, the function should now properly recache the marker style attributes when called, thus fixing the bug related to markers not appearing hollow as expected.

This updated function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
