To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly called and that the markers are correctly set as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here are the steps to fix the bug based on the analysis:

1. The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is called incorrectly and the `fillstyle='none'` is not being handled appropriately to make the markers hollow.
   
2. To resolve this issue, we need to update the function to handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly to make markers hollow.

3. The bug causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, leading to unexpected behavior where the markers are not hollow as intended.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check for the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called properly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Check fillstyle for making markers hollow
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter to make markers hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle='none'`.
