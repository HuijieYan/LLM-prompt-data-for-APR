To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called correctly to assign proper values to the variables. Currently, the function is called without any checks or conditionals, which may lead to unexpected behavior. We will modify the function to perform necessary checks before executing `_marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Adding a check for fillstyle
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we explicitly set `_filled` to `False`. This modification ensures that the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is explicitly set to `'none'`.

By making this change, the behavior of the markers with hollow fillstyle should match the expected output provided in the GitHub issue.
