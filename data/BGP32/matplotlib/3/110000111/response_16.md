## Buggy Function Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_recache(self)` within the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function is supposed to recache the marker style properties, but there seems to be an issue with the assignment of properties within the function.
3. The issue seems to be related to not properly updating the `self._filled` property when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
4. To fix the bug, the logic related to the `self._filled` property needs to be adjusted.
5. The bug reported in the GitHub issue is related to the markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This aligns with the identified potential error in the function.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `self._filled` property is correctly updated to `False`. This adjustment will allow the marker to be hollow as expected.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the logic inside the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` property and set the `filled` property accordingly, the bug should be fixed.
