## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes several internal variables of the `MarkerStyle` class and calls a `_marker_function` if it's not `None`.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` while using `ax.scatter()` does not create hollow markers as expected. This suggests that the bug might be related to how the `fillstyle` parameter is handled in the `MarkerStyle` class.
3. The current implementation of `_recache` sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which might be causing the markers not to be hollow as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` parameter is set based on the `fillstyle` provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` class.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` parameter is set based on the `fillstyle` provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` class. This change ensures that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
