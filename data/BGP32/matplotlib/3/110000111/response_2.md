To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the correct marker function is called based on the fillstyle parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the marker should not be filled. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

This correction ensures that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow as expected. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`.
