To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called correctly to update the marker properties based on the provided `fillstyle`. 

The bug in the current implementation is that the `_marker_function` is called without setting up the `self._filled` property to reflect the 'filled' status based on the `fillstyle`, leading to incorrect marker appearance.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version:
- We check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and update the `_filled` property accordingly to make the marker hollow.
- The `_snap_threshold` is set to `float('inf')` to represent infinity.
- The `_joinstyle` and `_capstyle` remain unchanged as 'round' and 'butt' respectively.
- Finally, call the `_marker_function` to refresh the marker properties based on the updates.

This corrected version should now correctly handle the 'fillstyle' parameter and create hollow markers when needed, fixing the issue reported on GitHub.
