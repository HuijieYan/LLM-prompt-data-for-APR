        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = Path(array([[0.0, -1.0], ... [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 79], dtype=uint8))
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

Explanation:
1. The initial bug was related to the incorrect setting of the `_filled` variable. It was set to `True` instead of `False` resulting in filled markers instead of hollow markers. This was causing the issue described in the GitHub problem.
2. To fix this bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

The corrected version now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute as `False`, ensuring that markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is passed as an argument.
