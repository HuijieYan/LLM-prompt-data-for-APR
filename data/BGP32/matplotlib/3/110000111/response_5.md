## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset specific attributes to default values. The bug arises from calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is assigned properly. This leads to an unexpected behavior when trying to reset the marker style attributes.

## Bug Explanation
When the `_recache` function is called without checking if `self._marker_function` is assigned correctly, it results in unintentional function execution. In this case, it doesn't reset the attributes as intended, causing issues with the marker style appearance. The `MarkerStyle` object cannot properly display the markers as hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `self._marker_function` is assigned properly before calling it. If it is not assigned, the function should return without executing it. This ensures that the marker style attributes are reset only when the marker function is available.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By implementing the corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class will function as intended, properly resetting the marker style attributes when needed.
