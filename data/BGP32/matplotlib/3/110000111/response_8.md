Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of certain variables, causing unexpected behavior when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` in MarkerStyle.

The issue arises from the fact that the `_filled` variable is always initialized to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` value provided in MarkerStyle. This leads to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the provided `fillstyle` in MarkerStyle. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`. The rest of the function remains unchanged.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the markers will now behave as expected when using `'none'` fillstyle, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
