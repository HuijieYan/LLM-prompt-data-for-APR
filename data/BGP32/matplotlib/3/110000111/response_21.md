To fix the buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is called correctly when it is not `None`. Additionally, we need to set the correct values for the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter.

Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation of changes:
1. Added condition to set `_filled` based on whether `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.
2. Called `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles setting the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `self._fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that markers can be rendered as hollow when desired.
