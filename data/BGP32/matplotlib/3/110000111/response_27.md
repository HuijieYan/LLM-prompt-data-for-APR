## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for reinitializing certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. It sets default values for various properties like `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, `_filled`, etc.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` for markers does not result in hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`. This bug stems from the incorrect handling of the `_filled` property within the function.

## Error Location:
- The bug occurs in the assignment of `_filled = True` within the `_recache` function, meaning that all markers are being filled instead of being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `_filled` property in the `_recache` function. The `_filled` property is always set to `True`, which results in all markers being filled regardless of the `fillstyle` option specified. This behavior contradicts the expected outcome of having hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` option provided. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve the desired outcome of hollow markers.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check fillstyle and set filled accordingly
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a check for `fillstyle` within the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` property based on the specified `fillstyle`.
- If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` is set to `False` to ensure markers are hollow when rendered.

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now handle the `fillstyle='none'` scenario correctly, addressing the reported bug.
