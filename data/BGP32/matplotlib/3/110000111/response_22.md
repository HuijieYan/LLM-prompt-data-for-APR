## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache some attributes of the marker style.
2. The function resets several attributes and then calls the `_marker_function()` method which seems to be responsible for updating the marker based on the style.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.
4. The bug seems to be with the `_marker_function()` not correctly updating the marker style based on the `fillstyle`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug can be explained by the fact that the expected behavior of creating hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'` is not being implemented correctly by the `_marker_function()` method. This method is responsible for updating the marker based on the style attributes, but it seems to not handle the case of `fillstyle='none'` properly.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_marker_function()` method to properly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'` is set. When `fillstyle='none'`, the marker should be rendered as a hollow marker. We can achieve this by modifying the marker path and drawing only the outline of the marker, leaving the center transparent. 

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If it is, we set `_filled` to `False` which indicates that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, if `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, we set `_filled` to `True` to indicate the marker should be filled. By updating `_filled` based on `fillstyle`, the marker will be rendered correctly as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
