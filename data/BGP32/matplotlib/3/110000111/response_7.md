## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is supposed to initialize the `_filled` variable as `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but it is always setting it to `True`, which causes the markers not to be hollow as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check for `fillstyle` and setting the `_filled` variable based on that check, the corrected function will properly handle creating hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
