## Analysis
The buggy `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to their default values if a marker function is not set. However, the expected behavior, as indicated by the GitHub issue, is that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers which is currently not happening.

## Bug
The bug is that even though the `fillstyle` is intended to be set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter value. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`. If `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```
