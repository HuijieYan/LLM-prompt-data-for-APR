### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class sets various attributes without checking the condition of the `_marker_function`. This leads to unexpected behavior when calling `self._marker_function()` without verifying its existence.
2. The failing test is aimed at checking if the marker is filled, but due to the bug in `_recache`, the fill style is not being applied correctly.
3. In the failing case, the `_path` is set to a non-empty value, and `_filled` is set to `True`, leading to the issue where the marker is not hollow as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is checked before calling it to correctly handle the fill style.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._filled:
            self._filled = False  # Ensure fill style is 'none' if required
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` within the `_recache` function if the fill style should be 'none', ensuring that markers will be hollow as expected when using the specified fill style.
