Based on the given information, the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is related to the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it should not. This causes the test case to fail.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is happening because the `_marker_function` is being called within the `_recache` function, but it is not setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`. This leads to the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `True`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to check for the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now correctly handle the marker styles. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
