### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function assigned to the object. This is leading to incorrect behavior when trying to check if the marker is filled or not.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the `_filled` attribute to be set to `True` regardless of the marker function, leading to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`. This is not the intended behavior, especially when trying to render hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the assigned marker function. This way, when checking if the marker is filled or not, the correct value will be used, allowing the `is_filled` method to work as expected.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        self._filled = self._marker_function.__name__ not in ['_draw_unfilled_marker']
```

In the corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the name of the marker function. If the function name is not `_draw_unfilled_marker`, then `_filled` will be set to `True`, indicating that the marker should be filled. Otherwise, it will be set to `False`, indicating a hollow marker. This change will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the assigned marker function.
