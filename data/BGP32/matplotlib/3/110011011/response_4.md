### Issue Analysis
The issue is related to the MarkerStyle class where when setting the fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected. The failing test asserts that the MarkerStyle object should not be filled, but it fails due to the incorrect behavior in the buggy _recache function.

### Error Location
The issue lies within the _recache function where the _marker_function is called. This can cause unexpected behavior in setting the fillstyle as 'none'.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the _marker_function is being called without ensuring it handles the fillstyle correctly. This results in the markers not appearing hollow when 'none' fillstyle is set.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the _marker_function properly handles the fillstyle parameter, especially when it is set to 'none'. Additionally, we should update the _recache function to handle fillstyle correctly and ensure that it reflects the desired appearance of the markers.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._fillstyle = 'full'  # Ensure fillstyle defaults to 'full'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By explicitly checking and updating the filled attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected version of the _recache function should ensure that when 'none' fillstyle is set, the markers are displayed as hollow as desired.
