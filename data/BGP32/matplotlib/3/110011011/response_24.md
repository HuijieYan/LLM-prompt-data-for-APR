### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly handle the situation where the `_marker_function` attribute is not `None`.
2. The failing test is checking if a marker style object is filled or not, but due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the fill status is not correctly updated.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, which leads to the assertion error in the test case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is correctly updated based on the values provided during initialization.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, when `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. This change ensures that the fill status of the marker style object is correctly handled.

By making this adjustment, the test case should now pass without any assertion errors, and the marker should be displayed as hollow when used with `ax.scatter()` and a fillstyle set to 'none'.
