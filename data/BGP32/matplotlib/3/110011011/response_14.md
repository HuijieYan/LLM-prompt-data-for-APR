The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is attempting to call `self._marker_function()` without checking for its existence or validity. This results in an error when `self._marker_function` is not properly defined, as seen in the failing test message.

### Error Cause:
The failing test is trying to verify if the marker style is not filled using the `is_filled` method. Due to the bug in the `_recache` function, when `self._marker_function` is not initialized or valid, the call to `self._marker_function()` leads to an error, making it impossible to properly set the filled property to false.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` is properly validated before attempting to call it. We will also modify the function to correctly set the filled property based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if self._fillstyle in ['none', 'none']:  # Check if fillstyle is 'none' or 'none' (handle typo)
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the `fillstyle`, we can now properly set the `filled` property of the `MarkerStyle` class based on the input. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
