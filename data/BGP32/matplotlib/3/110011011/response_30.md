### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes of the class instance. It appears that the issue lies in the `_marker_function` method's invocation, which is not correctly leading to the desired behavior of making markers hollow.

When the failing test tries to check if the marker style is not filled as expected after setting `fillstyle='none'`, it fails because the implementation of the `is_filled` method is not properly handling the case of having `fillstyle='none'`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling or missing logic related to `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The `_marker_function` might not be correctly updating the fill status of the marker.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `_recache` is setting the `self._filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter being set to `'none'`. This leads to markers being filled even when they are expected to be hollow based on the provided `fillstyle`.

The failing test in the GitHub issue is a result of this bug. The `is_filled` method probably checks the `self._filled` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled, but that attribute is always set to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic inside `_recache` to reflect the desired behavior based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function` properly updates the fill status of markers if it is responsible for that behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function now properly checks the `fillstyle` before setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.
