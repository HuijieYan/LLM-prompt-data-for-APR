### Fixing the Bug

#### 1. Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes certain attributes including `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. It then attempts to execute the `_marker_function`, which is supposed to define the marker's path, but this is done without any checks or conditions.

The error occurs when trying to determine if `MarkerStyle` is filled or not, and the failing test indicates the problem at the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`, showing that the style is not being correctly set to 'none'.

#### 2. Identifying Potential Error Locations
The issue most likely lies in the assignment of `_filled` to `True` regardless of the selected `fillstyle`.

#### 3. Explaining the Bug
The bug causes the `MarkerStyle` to always be considered "filled" even when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This results in the function `is_filled` returning `True`, leading to the failing assertion in the test case.

#### 4. Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. By ensuring that `fillstyle='none'` results in `_filled` being set to `False`, the issue should be resolved.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the logic to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we can ensure that the correct filled/hollow appearance is applied to the markers as intended.
