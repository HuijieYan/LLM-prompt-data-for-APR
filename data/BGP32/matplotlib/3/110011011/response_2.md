### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is inside the `MarkerStyle` class located in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`.
2. The function is meant to reset certain attributes when called. However, the issue arises when the `_marker_function` is called as a method without checking if it is defined.
3. The failing test is checking whether the marker is filled or not, but due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the marker is always filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter set to `'none'`.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.
5. The corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition in the `_recache` function, the issue with always filled markers should be resolved.
