The bug in the provided function `_recache()` is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without properly checking if it is defined or not. This results in an error during runtime when trying to call an undefined function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is None, then we should skip the function call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional `if self._marker_function` before calling the function, we ensure that the function is only called if it is defined, resolving the runtime error and fixing the bug.

This fix will address the issue posted on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` in `MarkerStyle` did not result in hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter()`.
