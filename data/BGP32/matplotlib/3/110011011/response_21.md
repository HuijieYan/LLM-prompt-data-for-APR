## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that is supposed to modify several attributes based on the current marker style. However, in the buggy implementation, the `self._marker_function()` is called without assigning its result to any variable or checking its return value. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The error message in the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value (`True`). This is likely due to the incomplete or incorrect initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object, causing the `_filled` attribute not to be set correctly.
3. The runtime values indicate that the `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes are being set to default values. However, the `_marker_function` is called but its result is not considered in the attribute assignments. This leads to potentially incorrect state for the `MarkerStyle` object.
4. To fix the bug, the result of `_marker_function` should be assigned to a variable, and based on this result, the attributes should be updated accordingly to reflect the desired marker style.
5. The corrected version below addresses this issue by assigning the result of `_marker_function` to a variable `marker_props` and updating the attributes based on this result during the recache process.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        marker_props = self._marker_function()
        self._path = marker_props.get('path', _empty_path)
        self._transform = marker_props.get('transform', IdentityTransform())
        self._alt_path = marker_props.get('alt_path', None)
        self._alt_transform = marker_props.get('alt_transform', None)
        self._snap_threshold = marker_props.get('snap_threshold', None)
        self._joinstyle = marker_props.get('joinstyle', 'round')
        self._capstyle = marker_props.get('capstyle', 'butt')
        self._filled = marker_props.get('filled', True)
```

In this corrected version, the `_marker_function` result is stored in `marker_props`, which is a dictionary containing the properties of the marker style. The attributes of `MarkerStyle` are then updated based on the values retrieved from `marker_props`, ensuring that the marker style is correctly initialized according to the desired properties.
