The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function` unconditionally without any check or validation. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as seen in the failing test.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `_recache` function initializes multiple instance variables including `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`.
- After initializing these variables, it calls `self._marker_function()` without any condition checking. This implies that this function call is crucial for the correct behavior of the class.
- The failing test asserts that `not marker_style.is_filled()` which means `marker_style.is_filled()` is expected to return `False`.
- The test fails because `self._marker_function()` could potentially set `_filled` to `True`, leading to the failed assertion.

### Fixed version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version above, we added a conditional check before calling `self._marker_function()` to ensure it is only called if it is not `None`, preventing unexpected behavior when the function is not set correctly.

This fix should address the issue in the failing test and align with the expected behavior where `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`.
