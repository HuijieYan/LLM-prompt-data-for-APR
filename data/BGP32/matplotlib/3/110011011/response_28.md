Based on the provided information, the issue arises from the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class not correctly handling the `is_filled` method, leading to incorrect behavior with the `fillstyle='none'` parameter.

### Error Analysis:
1. The `_recache` method sets `_filled = True` unconditionally, which conflicts with the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` to create hollow markers.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which implies that `_filled` is always set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization. If `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be assigned based on the fillstyle provided during marker style initialization. This ensures that the `is_filled` method behavior aligns with the intended fillstyle setting, allowing for the creation of hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'`.
