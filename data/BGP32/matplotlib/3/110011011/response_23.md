### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`, which seems to be the root cause of the issue.
2. The failing test is trying to check if the marker is filled or not after setting `fillstyle='none'`.
3. Looking at the runtime values provided, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` initially. After calling `_recache`, it remains `True`, which is incorrect given the intention to make the marker hollow.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` should make the marker hollow in a scatter plot, but the current implementation is not achieving this.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the default setting of `_filled` as `True` instead of changing it to `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified, the corrected version of the function should now make the marker hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
