The bug in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class causes the `is_filled` method to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`. This leads to the failing test case where the marker is expected to be hollow but is actually filled.

### Issues in the Buggy Function:
1. The `_marker_function` is called without considering the `fillstyle`.
2. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle`. Consequently, the `is_filled` method wrongly returns `True`, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Modify the logic to handle the `fillstyle` appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function ensures that the marker will correctly appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
