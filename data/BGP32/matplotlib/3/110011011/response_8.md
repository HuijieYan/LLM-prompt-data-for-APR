## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class but then calls an undefined `self._marker_function`. This results in an AttributeError when the function `is_filled` is called, as it does not exist in the current implementation. This bug prevents the intended behavior of setting markers to be hollow using `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the call to `self._marker_function()` within the `_recache` function, which is not defined or implemented in the provided code. This undefined function call leads to an AttributeError when trying to check if the marker is filled.

## Fix Strategy
1. Remove the call to `self._marker_function()` since it is not defined or required for the functionality related to marker fillstyle.
2. To address the issue reported on GitHub, ensure that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, markers appear hollow when used in plots.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly reflect the desired behavior when `fillstyle='none'` is set, and the markers will appear hollow as expected.
