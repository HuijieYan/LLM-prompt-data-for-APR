The issue in the buggy function `_recache()` is with the line `self._marker_function()` where the function is being called without checking if it is actually defined. This results in a runtime error when `is_filled()` is called, as the function `_marker_function` is `None` leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before executing it.
2. Update the `MarkerStyle` class to include a method `is_filled()` that returns the `_filled` attribute correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the `is_filled()` method, the function will return the correct value of `_filled` and avoid the error encountered in the test. Now the behavior of `MarkerStyle` will match the expected functionality and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
