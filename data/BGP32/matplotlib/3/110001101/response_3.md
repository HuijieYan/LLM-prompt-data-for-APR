## Correction:

The bug in the `_recache` function is related to the incorrect initialization of the `self._filled` variable. The expected behavior is to set `self._filled` to `False`, but it is currently being set to `True` unconditionally.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers_corrected.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'

        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now correctly set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, satisfying the expected input/output values.
