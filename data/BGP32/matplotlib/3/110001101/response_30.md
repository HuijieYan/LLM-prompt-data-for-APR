The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values if `_marker_function` is `None`. However, the function calls `_marker_function` regardless of its value, potentially causing unintended behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function `_recache` does not check if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it.
- This can lead to unnecessary execution of `_marker_function` even when it is supposed to be skipped.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, ensuring that it is only executed when necessary.
