## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the `_fillstyle` attribute to `'none'` as expected in both cases. This is leading to incorrect behavior in terms of the expected values of the `_filled` attribute at the end of the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add the missing assignment of `_fillstyle` to `'none'` in the function. This will ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` as expected in both cases.

## The corrected version of the buggy function 
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Added line to fix the bug
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_fillstyle` attribute will be correctly set to `'none'`, ensuring that the `_filled` attribute behaves as expected in both cases.
