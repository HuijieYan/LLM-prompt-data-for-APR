The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call a method `_marker_function` without checking if it actually exists. This results in a `NoneType` object being called as a function, causing a runtime error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is a callable object before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Fixed version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` we ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. This prevents the runtime error and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
