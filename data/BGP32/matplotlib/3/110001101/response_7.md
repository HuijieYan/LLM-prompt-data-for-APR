### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing an assignment for the `_filled` attribute based on the expected input values. The expected value for `_filled` in Case 2 is `False` but it is not set in the function. This is causing the bug.

### Fix:
We need to assign the correct value to the `_filled` attribute based on the expected input values. In this case, we should set `_filled = False` before calling the `_marker_function()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
