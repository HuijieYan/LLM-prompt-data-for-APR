There are a few issues in the buggy function `_recache` that need to be addressed:

1. The function is checking if `self._marker_function` is None before executing it. This check should be removed, as the function should always be executed.

2. The function is not setting the correct value for `self._filled`. It should be set to `False` instead of `True`.

With these issues in mind, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly set the `_filled` variable to `False` and always execute the `_marker_function`. This will align the function with the expected behavior.
