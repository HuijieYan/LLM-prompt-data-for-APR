### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize some attributes, then call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. The issue lies in the fact that the function does not properly reset the `_filled` attribute to `False`. This results in the `_filled` attribute remaining `True` even after re-caching.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not resetting the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to explicitly set `_filled` to `False` during the re-caching process. By doing this, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is reset to the correct value.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Reset _filled to False during re-caching
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the line `self._filled = False` in the `_recache` function, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is properly reset to `False` during re-caching, as expected in the test cases.
