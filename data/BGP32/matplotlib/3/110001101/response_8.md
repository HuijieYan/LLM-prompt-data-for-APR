The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `self._filled` variable is not being set to the expected value of `False`. This is causing the function to not behave as expected in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to set the `self._filled` variable to `False` instead of `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The fixed version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `self._filled` to `False`, we ensure that the expected behavior of the function is maintained.
