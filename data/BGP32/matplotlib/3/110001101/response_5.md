### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes certain attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function` method. However, it fails to set the attribute `self._fillstyle` to `'none'` before making the call to `_marker_function`. This leads to a discrepancy in the expected and actual values of `self._filled`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `self._filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, but the expected behavior is to set it to `False` only if `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Since `self._fillstyle` is not being set explicitly in the `_recache` function, `self._filled` remains `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first ensure that `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'` before calling `_marker_function` so that `self._filled` is correctly set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Added line to fix the bug
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the line `self._fillstyle = 'none'` before the check for filling in `_filled`, we ensure that `self._fillstyle` is properly set, and subsequently `self._filled` will be set to `False` as expected.
