### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the condition `if self._marker_function is None`. In the given implementation, regardless of the value of `self._marker_function`, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly setting the value of `_filled` based on the condition `if self._marker_function is None`. This results in the `_filled` attribute always being set to `True`, regardless of the actual value it should have.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the condition.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the condition `if self._marker_function is None`. If `self._marker_function` is None, `_filled` is set to False, otherwise, it is set to True. This change ensures that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated as per the expected behavior.
