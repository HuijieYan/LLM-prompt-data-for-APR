The issue with the current implementation of the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` variable to `False` as expected in the test cases. This is causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable to `False` before calling the `_marker_function()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Update _filled to False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable to `False` before calling the `_marker_function()`, the function now correctly sets the expected value for `_filled` and satisfies the failing test cases.
