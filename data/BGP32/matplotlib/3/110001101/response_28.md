### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. However, it is currently missing an assignment to `self._fillstyle`, which leads to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug causes the `_filled` attribute to always remain `True`, even though it should be reset to `False` when `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
- This leads to incorrect behavior and potential errors when the `MarkerStyle` object is used with the wrong fill style.

### Fix Strategy:
- Add an assignment for `self._fillstyle` to the expected value `'none'` before resetting other attributes to ensure consistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Add this assignment
        self._filled = False  # Reset to False when _fillstyle is 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By including the assignment for `self._fillstyle` to `'none'` and resetting `self._filled` to `False` when `_fillstyle` is `'none'`, the corrected function ensures that the attributes are properly reset as expected.
