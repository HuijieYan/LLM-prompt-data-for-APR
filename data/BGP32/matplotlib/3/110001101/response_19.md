The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the input state. This behavior contradicts the expected values in the failing tests. To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to the correct value based on the input state.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the value of `_fillstyle`, ensuring that the expected values are met in the failing tests.
