The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `self._filled` variable is hardcoded to `True`, but the expected value is `False` in some cases. This discrepancy causes the function to not behave as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `self._filled` variable to the expected value in the second case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle == 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Now, the function correctly sets the `self._filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, fulfilling the expected behavior in all cases.
