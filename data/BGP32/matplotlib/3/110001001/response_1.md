### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` is missing the assignment of the `_marker_function` attribute, which is used to update the marker style. Without this assignment, the function tries to call a `None` object, causing a runtime error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly assigned before calling it. We can modify the `_recache` function to include this assignment as shown below:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the proper assignment of `_marker_function`, the bug should be fixed and the function should work correctly.
