### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly handling the `_marker_function`. It is supposed to check if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, but it is not doing so. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
